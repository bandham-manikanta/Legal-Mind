      "🧠 Answer: Police can conduct a warrantless vehicle search if they have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains evidence. This principle, known as the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment, allows for searches of areas where evidence might reasonably be found, as long as the searches meet the standard of reasonableness under the Constitution.\n",
      "📚 Reasoning: The automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment recognizes that vehicles are mobile and can quickly move evidence out of police reach. As a result, the courts have determined that police should be able to search vehicles without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe that evidence is present. This exception is limited, however, to areas where evidence might reasonably be found. This means that police cannot search the entire vehicle without a warrant, but rather must limit their search to specific areas where evidence is likely to be located. Additionally, all searches, whether with or without a warrant, must still meet the standard of reasonableness under the Constitution. This means that the search must be conducted in a manner that is not excessively intrusive or violates an individual's Fourth Amendment rights.\n"
