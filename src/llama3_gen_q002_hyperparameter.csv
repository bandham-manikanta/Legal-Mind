0.1,0.5,0.09239802649911116,0.8835483193397522,"**Answer:** A police officer can conduct a limited search of a suspect's outer clothing for weapons, known as a protective pat search or frisk, during an investigatory stop when the officer reasonably suspects that the person is about to commit a crime and the search is necessary for the officer's safety and the safety of others.

**Reasoning:** This is based on the principles established by the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio (1968) and reinforced by subsequent cases such as United States v. Peep (8th Cir. 1974) and State v. Gobely (Minn. 1985), as referenced in Context 1. These cases support the notion that if an officer has a reasonable suspicion that a person is about to commit a crime, a limited pat search for weapons is justified to ensure the safety of both the officer and the community. This type of search is considered a lesser intrusion than a full search and is permissible under the Fourth Amendment when the officer's safety is at risk, even if there isn't enough evidence for an arrest.",llama3_gen_q002

**Reasoning:** This is based on the principles established by the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio (1968) and subsequent jurisprudence, which permit a brief, limited search for weapons when an officer has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that a person is involved in criminal activity and the search is justified by concerns for the officer's safety and the safety of others. This is particularly relevant in contexts where the officer believes the suspect might be armed and pose an immediate danger, as highlighted in various legal contexts provided across the given scenarios.",llama3_gen_q002

**Reasoning:** This is based on the principles established by the landmark case Terry v. Ohio, which permits a stop or seizure when an officer reasonably suspects a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime. The protective pat search is justified in the interests of officer and community safety, as seen in cases like United States v. Peep, where a pat search for weapons was deemed reasonable when officers knew the defendant had bragged about shooting a police officer. This approach balances the need for public safety with the individual's Fourth Amendment rights, allowing for a brief, limited search for weapons in situations where there is a reasonable suspicion of imminent criminal activity.",llama3_gen_q002

0.7,0.5,0.13491517237531306,0.8765823841094971,"**Answer:** A police officer can conduct a limited search of a suspect's outer clothing for weapons during an investigatory stop if the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect is armed and dangerous, based on specific and articulable facts, and the search is limited to a pat-down of the suspect's outer clothing.

**Reasoning:** This answer is based on the principles established in the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio (1968), which permits a brief, non-intrusive search for weapons (known as a ""stop and frisk"" or ""pat-down"") when an officer has a reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed and dangerous. This is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, balancing the need for officer safety with the individual's right against unreasonable searches. The key elements are: (1) the officer must have a reasonable suspicion based on specific, articulable facts, (2) the suspect must reasonably appear to be armed and dangerous, and (3) the search must be limited in scope to a pat-down of the outer clothing for weapons. (Contexts 1, 3, and 6 provide relevant background on Terry stops and the balance between officer safety and individual rights.)",llama3_gen_q002

**Reasoning:** This answer is based on the principles established by the landmark case Terry v. Ohio (1968) and reinforced by subsequent jurisprudence. According to Terry, a brief, non-intrusive search for weapons (known as a ""stop and frisk"") is permissible during an investigatory stop if the officer has a reasonable suspicion, grounded in specific and articulable facts, that the suspect is armed and dangerous. This limited search is justified by the need to ensure officer safety and prevent potential harm. Contexts 1, 3, 6, and 18 provide foundational support for this reasoning, discussing the balance between individual rights and public safety, the scope of investigative detentions, and the criteria for reasonable suspicion in the context of searches and seizures.",llama3_gen_q002
0.7,0.9,0.1542410800434597,0.8839866518974304,"Answer: A police officer can conduct a limited search of a suspect's outer clothing for weapons, also known as a pat-down or frisk, during an investigatory stop if the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect is armed and presently dangerous, based on specific and articulable facts, and the search is limited to a pat-down of the suspect's outer clothing to discover weapons.

Reasoning: This answer is based on the principles established in the landmark case of Terry v. Ohio (1968) and reinforced in subsequent jurisprudence. According to Terry, a brief, non-intrusive search for weapons (a frisk) is permissible during an investigatory stop (a Terry stop) if the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed and presently dangerous. This standard balances the individual's Fourth Amendment rights against the need for officer safety during the encounter. The search must be limited in scope to a pat-down for weapons and cannot escalate into a more intrusive search without additional justification, such as probable cause. (Context 1 provides the foundational context for this reasoning, with additional supportive implications from other contexts regarding the balance between individual rights and officer safety during stops.)",llama3_gen_q002
