Thus, unlike those cases involving verbal agreements, we look to extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions \u2014 possibly found, for example, in a plea colloquy \u2014 only when the written contract is ambiguous. Cf United States v. Given, 164 F.3d 389, 396 (7th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). In this context, we have the power to review holding that an unambiguous plea agreement is entitled to great evidentiary weightholding that the district court properly declined to consider extrinsic evidence where the plea agreement was unambiguousholding extrinsic evidence contradicting language in will inadmissible when will is unambiguousholding that a court may consider extrinsic evidence to determine whether a contract is ambiguousholding that extrinsic evidence admissible to determine intent of parties"

State, 905 So.2d 990, 991 (Fla. 3d DCA) (<HOLDING>), review denied, 917 So.2d 193 (Fla.2005); holding that apprendi does not apply retroactively to claims raised in a 2255 motionholding that apprendi does not retroactively apply to 2241 petitionsholding that because apprendi does not apply retroactively neither does blakelyholding that blakely does not apply retroactively to 2255 motionsholding that apprendi does not retroactively apply to 2255 motions"

Furthermore, that a state agency faced with a large judgment against it \"might be compelled to rely on increased state subsidies\" has expressly been rejected by the Third Circuit as insufficient to accord the agency with alter ego status. Bolden, 953 F.2d at 819; see Fitchik, 873 F.2d at 661 (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the thrust of this first holding that 1983 does not override a states eleventh amendment immunityholding that a complaint that fails to meet the pleading requirements does not invoke the statutory waiver of sovereign immunityholding that 1983 does not override states eleventh amendment immunityholding that states appropriation to agency of funds to meet any shortfall does not trigger immunityholding negligence in supervision and evaluation of student in governmental units custody does not trigger waiver of immunity"

In Dep\u2019t of Navy, this court held that collective bargaining was in the public interest, and the union, as the chosen bargaining representative, was the party specifically designated by Congress to further that public interest. In this case, by contrast, Congress has authorized the contracting federal agency and the Department of Labor to safeguard the public interest embodied in the Davis-Bacon Act by giving them the power to enforce the statute.

In his petition, Wilkerson states he filed his motion in February 2001, and, that after the trial court denied relief, he moved for rehearing. Wilkerson claims that the trial court never ruled on the motion for rehearing. At our request, the State filed a response which confirms the filing of the motion for rehearing. In response to Wilkerson\u2019s 2010 motion to hear and rule, the trial judge apparently wrote a memo denying rehearing.

In his petition, Wilkerson states he filed his motion in February 2001, and, that after the trial court denied relief, he moved for rehearing. Wilkerson claims that the trial court never ruled on the motion for rehearing. At our request, the State filed a response which confirms the filing of the motion for rehearing. In response to Wilkerson\u2019s 2010 motion to hear and rule, the trial judge apparently wrote a memo denying rehearing.

The cases examining the intent to preserve the right to appeal typically lack a written plea agreement, however, which is a significant difference from the case now before us. Written plea agreements are contracts, and we interpret them according to general principles of contract law. United States v. Hernandez, 544 F.3d 743, 750 (7th Cir.2008). Thus, unlike those cases involving verbal agreements, we look to extrinsic evidence of the parties\u2019 intentions \u2014 possibly found, for example, in a plea colloquy \u2014 only when the written contract is ambiguous.

The release eligibility date would then be determined by agreement rather than the Range. Thus, the statutory ranges and the corresponding release eligibility percentages would be virtually meaningless, with sentencing structure governed by contract rather than by statute.

Marek erroneously contends that the Court also must consider all of the evidence he presented in his prior postconviction proceedings in an effort to establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (<HOLDING>). Marek overlooks that throughout the extensive holding that to demonstrate a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel petition must establish that the alleged error was prejudicial in factholding that where trial counsel was not ineffective appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise claim of ineffectiveness of trial counselholding that to demonstrate deficient performance a petitioner must show counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed a defendant by the sixth amendmentholding that to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel a defendant must demonstrate that counsel was constitutionally deficient and as a result defendant was prejudicedrecognizing a constitutional claim for ineffective assistance of counsel"

Based on review of virtually all, if not all, reported opinions of federal courts dealing with the 1887 and 1911 versions, this Court has located no opinion where a court utilized it as applicable to any receiver or property manager other than one appointed by a federal court. See, e.g., Investment Registry v. Chicago & M. Elec. Ry. Co., 204 F. 500, 507 (E.D.Wis.1913); In re Kalb & Berger Mfg. Co., 165 F. 895, 896 (2d Cir.1908). With only one exception, this remained true after the statute was revised in 1948. See, e.g., SEC v. Lincoln Thrift Ass\u2019n, 557 F.2d 1274, 1277 n. 1 (9th Cir.1977); Republic Bank of Chicago v.

We have held, of course, that requiring \u201ctorture or depravity of mind\u201d does not solve the vagueness problem. Requiring only torture, however, does. See Maynard v.

Coe says that because Tennessee\u2019s waiver practice has not been consistent in cases with similar circumstances, it cannot serve as the basis for a procedural bar. The state responds by citing numerous eases that establish waiver, and it has the better of the argument. Coe\u2019s eases are mostly either adverse, or too old to constitute current \u201cstrict and regular\u201d practice.

The first are those actions that are brought in an individual capacity for a personal wrong. See Hunter v. Old Ben Coal Co., 844 F.2d 428, 432 (7th Cir.1988)(<HOLDING>).

We agree with the State\u2019s concession, however, that this memo does not constitute a properly filed written order. See State v. Wagner, 863 So.2d 1224 (Fla.2004) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we grant the petition and remand holding that signed court minutes are not proper ordersholding that orders overruling claims of privilege and requiring disclosure are immediately appealable as collateral ordersholding that orders remanding an action to a federal agency are generally not considered final appealable ordersholding that remand orders are also appealable orders under 28 usc 1291recognizing that orders denying motions to reopen are treated as final orders of removal"

We have carefully reviewed each argument asserted on appeal, and for the foregoing reasons, the judgment, sentence, and forfeiture of the district court are AFFIRMED. 1 . In his initial brief, Duncan made this Ap-prendi-type argument only with respect to the drug type issue, and not with respect to the other two enhancements referenced in any of the briefs, i.e., the firearm and role enhancements. Accordingly, he is not entitled to have this Court entertain the argument with respect to those other two enhancements. See United States v.

CONCLUSION \u00b6 21 For these reasons, we vacate the superior court\u2019s order granting Progressive\u2019s motion and dismissing the complaint. This matter is remanded for further proceedings. CONCURRING: PATRICIA K. NORRIS, Presiding Judge and PATRICIA A. OROZCO, Judge. 1 . The complaint names George Pop as the defendant. Duncan has not amended the complaint to substitute the Estate of George Pop for George Pop. Progressive, however, has not contested the propriety of the complaint and it has proceeded as though the Estate of Pop is a named defendant. Accordingly, for purposes of this decision, we assume that the complaint is sufficient as against Pop's estate. See Pargman v.

In order to exercise its discretion fairly, a district court needs flexibility in deciding whether to reduce a fee request and, if so, by how much. B. In the instant case, the defendants\u2019 challenge to the amount of time spent by Gross tests the outer limits of the specificity requirement. Although the issue is a close one, we hold that the challenge meets this requirement. We also hold, with less difficulty, that the challenge to the fee award requested by McGahen was raised with sufficient clarity. However, we hold that the district court erred by reducing the fee request for Gross\u2019s law clerk, because it was never challenged by the defendants. Cf. Missouri v.

Duration of Seizure The fourth McArthur factor considers whether the length of the seizure was reasonably related to the law-enforcement interest at stake. Scmgineto-Miranda accounts for this factor as part of its totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, see supra note 7.
