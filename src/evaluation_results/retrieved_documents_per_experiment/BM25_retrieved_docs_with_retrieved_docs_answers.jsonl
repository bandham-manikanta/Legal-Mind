In Mississippi criminal cases, this generally means that the court will qualify enough jurors to ensure the defendant and the state can exercise their challenges and still have the required number for the trial (typically 12 jurors for felony cases).","COMBINED_RETRIEVED_DOCS":"error in the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. This assignment of error is without merit. II. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE JURY WAS SELECTED \u00b6 7. Robinson assigns error to the trial court\u2019s method of jury selection. Robinson\u2019s only claim rests on a vague recitation of Rule 4.05(2) of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court without any additional argument or citation to authority in support thereof. Robinson maintains a full panel of accepted jurors was not tendered to him after the State exercised its first round in the jury selection. Robinson is incorrect and misinterprets the selection procedure outlined in URCCC 4.05(2). Under URCCC 4.05(2) a full panel of jurors, meaning twelve, are tendered by the State after electing to exer , 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (<HOLDING>), neither of which are applicable to the holding that generally an unsworn statement by counsel is not evidence in the context of a batson hearingholding that evidence of the same name and that the former conviction was in same city and same court as the present case and the fact that the defendant did not offer any testimony to rebut the prima facie evidence of identity was sufficient to establish identityholding that probation does not constitute a sentenceholding that a defendants confirmation of a psrs findings does not waive a challenge on appeal where there is no conceivable strategic reason for not objecting to a sentence at a higher offense levelholding that racial identity between the objecting defendant and the excluded jurors does not constitute a relevant precondition for a batson challenge & \n\nmatter illustrates the impossibility of an adequate appellate review. During voir dire, the State inquired whether any of the prospective jurors or members of their families had experienced drug addiction problems, and it appears from the transcript that several answered affirmatively. Unfortunately, they are not identified by name or juror number. This is critical because Mr. McKenzie alleged that the State improperly exercised a peremptory challenge on the sole African-American member of the jury panel. The gist of Mr. McKenzie\u2019s argument was that the reason advanced by the State to sustain its challenge, although appearing race neutral, was pretextual. See Melbourne v. State, 679 So.2d 759 (Fla.1996). The Assistant State Attorney expressed concern that the juror seemed d 1994) (<HOLDING>). As did the Florida Supreme Court in Delap v. holding that defendants have a right to be present at voir direholding that when the purpose of the request is to compare the testimony of jurors but no such comparison was made at the trial level a court need not provide a free voir dire transcriptholding that trial minutes were not sufficient substitute for transcript of voir dire and could not afford meaningful review when both sides exercised peremptory challengesholding that the selection of the jury constitutes part of a public trialholding that missing portions of transcript of voir dire did not entitle the defendant to a new trial for murder because the alleged errors in jury selection were harmless as a matter of law & \n\nclerk\u2019s practice of almost always granting deferrals to jurors who requested them introduced a substantial element of voluntariness into jury service, and meant that the pool of K jurors consisted of individuals who had decided for various reasons not to serve at the time that their names were drawn from the divisional qualified wheels. As the former Fifth Circuit explained, \u201cThat the introduction of predilections of prospective jurors affects the random nature of the selection process cannot be gainsaid. Surely a district would be in substantial violation of the statute [JSSA] if it selected all its jurors by randomly drawing names from the qualified wheel and allowing those selected to opt in or out at will.\u201d Id.; see also United States v. Branscome, 682 F.2d 484, 485 (4th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). Arguably, then, when the clerk almost always holding the connection is an elementholding that use of volunteer jurors introduced an impermissible subjective element into jury selectionrecognizing that observations made during a psychiatric examination contain a subjective elementholding that a jury instruction directing the verdict on one element deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination on every element of the charged offense and thus constituted structural errorholding that knowledge element could not be deemed in favor of plaintiff where defendant objected to the omission of that element from the jury charge & \n\nprovides: Rather, upon a particularized showing supporting a reasonable belief that underrepre-sentation in the jury pool or the venire exists as the result of practices of systematic exclusion, the court must make a reasonable effort to accommodate the defendant\u2019s relevant requests for information designed to verify the existence of such underrepre-sentation and document its nature and extent. Gause I, supra, 959 A.2d at 685 (quoting People v. Jackson, 13 Cal.4th 1164, 56 Cal.Rptr.2d 49, 920 P.2d 1254, 1268 (1996)). In our view, this \"reasonable belief\u201d standard raises a whole host of questions but supplies very few answers. And, to add yet another layer of complexity, the division majority appeared to somehow qualify its endorsement of California\u2019s already confu 23 (6th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Shapiro, 994 F.Supp. 146, holding that defendants right to discovery was satisfied by inspection of master lists and the relevant demographic data about the general pool from which the grand jurors were selected and thus defendants were not entitled to the names addresses and demographics of the individual grand jurors who returned indictments against themholding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding that right was available in grand jury proceedingsholding that the prosecuting attorneys failure to instruct grand jurors on the record of the elements of the relevant criminal offenses warranted dismissal of the indictment without a showing of prejudiceholding that racial discrimination in selection of grand jurors compelled dismissal of indictment & \n\nto credit and what reasonable inferences to draw from that evidence. For example, the panel opinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski\u2019s assailant fled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he heard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police. Instead, the panel held that \u201cno rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski\u2019s screams.\u201d O\u2019Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 302. Although it would be entirely permissible for a jury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying the Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between competing reasonable inferences in this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>).

None of these individuals were ultimately empaneled: five were excused for cause because they stated they could not be fair and impartial, one was stricken by the defense using a peremptory challenge, and one was not selected. See State v. Rackley, 2000-NMCA-027, \u00b6 9, 128 N.M. 761, 998 P.2d 1212 (explaining that \u201c[t]he jury selection process, including the excusal of jurors for cause, insures that a defendant is tried before an impartial jury\u201d). Finally, Defendant had two remaining peremptory challenges at the conclusion of jury selection and has not offered an explanation as to why she did not exercise those challenges. See State v. Isiah, 1989-NMSC-063, \u00b6 29, 109 N.M. 21, 781 P.2d 293 (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds by State v. holding that a white defendant can object to the exclusion of minority jurors through the use of peremptory challengesholding that a defendants exercise of peremptory challenges is not denied or impaired when the defendant chooses to use a peremptory challenge to remove a juror who should have been excused for causeholding that is not the fact that a jury is all white or all black that violates batson rather it is the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to strike jurorsholding that the defendant was precluded from asserting error where the defendant had used all of his peremptory challenges and did not ask for moreholding that where a defendant does not use all of his or her peremptory challenges the defendant may not complain of prejudice for failure to dismiss prospective jurors & \n\nIt\u2019s a rather unusual circumstance, but I\u2019ve heard it before. Obviously, it\u2019s not unusual for participants in a trial to watch the jury, but we want to be sure that the jury is not made uncomfortable. So if I\u2019m correct that the regular attendees have been members of the family or friends of the defendants, I would appreciate counsel commenting to them when and as appropriate that we don\u2019t want to make the jurors uncomfortable, and what\u2019s actually a lot more interesting about a trial is what goes on in the well of the court and from the witness stand as opposed to the jury. So I share that with you just so you can convey the court\u2019s mild concern that the jurors not be made uncomfortable. It\u2019s nothing more than that. Okay? J.A. 915-16.

This Court agrees that the Koenigs waived any claim of juror bias by not advising the Court of these allegations at a time when the Court could have done something about them. This Court conducted voir dire to find out whether any member of the jury panel recognized any of the defendants or had provided goods or services to Coastal. One member of the panel was excused due to his familiarity with the defendants. None of the jurors acknowledged any relationship or familiarity before they were empaneled. Waiver has been found where juror misconduct was only alleged, as in the Koenigs\u2019 case. See, e.g., United States v. Dean, 667 F.2d 729, 730, 734 (8th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). Waiver has also been found where there was holding that where possible juror misconduct is brought to the trial judges attention he or she has a duty to investigate and to determine whether there may have been a violation of the sixth amendmentholding that it was not constitutionally permissible for the state to respond to defendants invocation of his statutory right to appeal by bringing a more serious charge against him prior to the trial de novo holding that litigants have a duty to disclose their objection to a prospective juror by promptly bringing the matter to the attention of the trial courtholding that although this court affords broad discretion to the district court in determining the type of investigation necessary to determine juror bias the district court must provide the defendant a meaningful opportunity to prove the sameholding that the defendant by not bringing his knowledge of possible juror bias to the attention of the district court prior to verdict waived his right to a new trial & \n\none of the central issues in this case \u2014 if not the central issue in this case \u2014 is whether that agreement extends to Google\u2019s current use of Digital Envoy\u2019s technology.

(Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter.

The justification for detaining appellant was markedly enhanced when Officer Chih learned (before taking him to the show-up) that appellant had recently arrived at the apartment (making it more likely that he was out in the neighborhood at the time of the robbery). Assessing the totality of these circumstances, the trial court properly avoided the \u201csort of divide-and-conquer analysis\u201d in which appellant engages. Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. 744. It did not err in concluding that the police acted reasonably in commanding appellant not to make any sudden moves, in patting him down to check for weapons, and in detaining him until the show-up procedure was complete. See Adams v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, 146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 32 L.Ed.2d 612 (1972) (<HOLDING>); Womack v.

As noted above, the officer who frisked Terry did so not because he believed Terry had committed a crime, but because he believed Terry was going to do so. Accordingly, if an officer reasonably suspects a person is about to commit a crime, a protective pat search is warranted in the interests of officer and community safety. United States v.

Many of these states simply cited a case from the federal circuit that covers the state to support their approach to this issue. {33} We disagree with the reasoning of the Seventh and Fifth Circuits and the state courts that follow them because it ignores the scope requirement of the second-prong of the Terry test, which our case law has consistently recognized as appropriate to analyze traffic stops. As we said in Werner, an officer\u2019s actions during the \u201cinvestigatory detention must be reasonably related to the circumstances that initially justified the stop.\u201d 117 N.M. at 317, 871 P.2d at 973; see, e.g., Taylor, 1999-NMCA-022, \u00b6 20, 126 N.M. 569, 973 P.2d 246 (<HOLDING>). We feel the cases relied upon by the Seventh holding that police officers are entitled to conduct an investigatory stop of a motorist if they have reasonable suspicion that the motorist has committed a traffic violationholding that where police officers had stopped a vehicle because they suspected that the motorist was intoxicated irrespective of whether the deputies were justified in detaining the motorist after he showed no signs of intoxication and even if they had not after approaching the motorist observed conditions raising a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot they were entitled to ask the motorist for permission to search his vehicleholding that defendant was unreasonably seized under fourth amendment when officer detained him to ask questions unrelated in scope to the reasons that justified the initial traffic stopholding that for purposes of determining whether the roadblock worked a fourth amendment seizure the controlling considerations are whether 1 the motorist was meant to be stopped by the physical obstacle of the roadblock and 2 the motorist was so stoppedholding that any questions an officer asks of a stopped motorist must be reasonably related to the circumstances which justified his initial stop & \n\nthe appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Consequently, we affirm the convictions. Affirmed. 1 . In ruling on the propriety of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, the appellate court considers the evidence introduced at the suppression hearing and at trial. See, e.g., Beasley v. Commonwealth, 60 Va.App. 381, 385 n.1, 728 S.E.2d 499, 501 n.1 (2012). The Court views that evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below, in this case the Commonwealth. E.g., id. 2 . As Land approached, the appellant \"jump[ed] out ... of the car.\u201d The officer \"instructed him to get back into the vehicle,\u201d and the appellant complied. 3 . The appellant\u2019s assignment of error also notes that Detective Fraser observed the traffic inf 258, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 2407, 168 L.Ed.2d 132 (2007) (<HOLDING>). 5 . The appellant cites no controlling or holding that like burglary car theft is a crime that often involves the use of weapons and other instruments of assault that could jeopardize police officer safety and thus justifies a protective frisk under terry to ensure officer safetyholding that it is reasonable that a police officer at the scene of an investigation will not let people move around in ways that could jeopardize his safety and discussing the various ways an officer may limit such movementholding that police officer did not exhibit reckless disregard for safety and wellbeing of others by negligently causing auto accident where officer looked both ways at intersection even though view was partially blockedholding that when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that illegal drugs are in the vehicle the officer may in the absence of factors allaying his safety concerns order the occupants out of the vehicle and pat them down briefly for weapons to ensure the officers safety and the safety of othersholding officer may search vehicle for weapons if officer has reasonable belief based on articulable facts that officer or another may be in danger & \n\nto justify briefly stopping individuals to question them \u201cabout their citizenship and immigration status ... but any further detention ... must be based on ... probable cause.\u201d Id. at 881-82, 95 S.Ct. 2574 (emphasis added) (citing Terry, 392 U.S. at 29, 88 S.Ct. 1868); see also id. at 884 (\u201c[Tjhe Fourth Amendment ... forbids stopping or detaining persons for questioning about their citizenship on less than a reasonable suspicion that they may be aliens\u201d). Guided by this Supreme Court prece-' dent, we have also required that immigration officers have reasonable suspicion to briefly stop individuals to question them regarding their immigration status and probable cause for any further arrest and detention. See, e.g., United States v. Mendez-de Jesus, 85 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>); Lopez v. Garriga, 917 F.2d 63, 69 (1st holding that passenger who attempts to walk away from a legal traffic stop cannot be detained absent reasonable suspicion of dangerous or criminal activityrecognizing that brignoniponce stands for the principle that an individual may not be briefly detained for questioning about citizenship absent reasonable suspicion that the person is an illegal alienholding that where an alien was ineligible for a visa as a matter of law his citizenship was illegally procured and subject to revocationrecognizing that an officer must have a reasonable articulable suspicion that the person has been is or is about to be engaged in criminal activity to frisk an individual for weapons and must have probable cause to conduct a further seizureholding that absent probable cause to arrest a police officer may approach an individual to conduct a brief investigatory stop when the officer has a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal conduct is afoot & \n\nclear error in this factual finding. The district court accordingly determined that Agent Woodruffs additional questioning of Chacon and Carrillo was not objectively reasonable because it did not conform to the justifying purpose of the stop\u2014determining the citizenship status of persons traveling through the Sierra Blanca checkpoint. Id. at *5-*7. The district court applied this court\u2019s decision in Portillo-Aguirre, a case involving the same checkpoint, the same Border Patrol agent and a similar factual scenario. In Portillo-Aguirre, this court held that where a border patrol agent has completed the immigration purpose of a stop, questioning that unduly prolongs the duration of the stop may be improper under the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Portillo-Aguirre, 311 F.3d at 657 (<HOLDING>). The district court\u2019s legal determination, holding that an officer has reasonable suspicion to conduct traffic stop even when his suspicion that a law has been violated is based on a reasonable mistake of lawrecognizing that police officer may stop a suspect if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afootholding that if an agent does not develop reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before the justifying purpose of a checkpoint stop has been accomplished he may not prolong the stopholding that reasonable suspicion is required to prolong a traffic stop after the purpose for which the investigatory stop was instituted has been accomplishedholding that an officer can stop an individual if the officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity is underfoot & \n\nwas found to have retained any privacy in the room after his eviction, the degree of privacy retained would not be significant under the totality of the circumstances. Additionally, while a hotel room may differ slightly from an in-home situation, Defendant and Nishimura still had the opportunity to hide weapons in the room just as they would have in a home. Because Nishimura was tasked with packing her belongings, the officers believed it necessary to secure the area from any danger posed to them. The Government argues that in the instant case, it would have been unreasonable for Special Agent Nutter to have left the drawer unsearched and jeopardized the safety of all present should Nishimura have gained access to a loaded gun. See United States v. Flippin, 924 F.2d 163 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Defendant counters that, here, a search for holding that the opening of a makeup bag was justified when a woman had grabbed the bag when the officer turned away had resisted it being taken from her the bag felt heavy her companion had been armed the previous day and the officer and individual were aloneholding the opening and inventory of a shoulder bag was reasonable despite the possible alternative of securing the bag as a wholeholding that when fleeing felon tossed a mesh bag weighing four or five pounds toward the officer the officer would have been justified if he fired at that moment out of fear that the bag might knock his firearm out of his hand but that he was not justified in firing after bag hit him and fell to the ground without injuring him and suspect turned and ranholding that search of shoulder bag was not authorized by search warrant for apartmentholding an officers reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed was sufficient justification for seizure of suspects makeup bag and exigent circumstances justified the subsequent warrantless search of the closed bag & \n\na white BMW. Appellant was not driving a white BMW at the time he was stopped. In fact, Sergeant Kasper could not identify any characteristic that Appellant had in common with Powell aside from his race, a trait that is shared by all African-American males in the City of Wilkes-Barre. \u00b6 11 \u201cDriving while black\u201d is not among the violations identified in the Motor Vehicle Code. Because the officer\u2019s identification of Appellant was predicated solely upon a vague racial description, we agree with Appellant that articulable and reasonable grounds for the stop did not exist. Consequently, the stop was invalid and all evidence flowing therefrom should have been suppressed as fruits of the unlawful stop. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 543 Pa. 612, 618-620, 673 A.2d 915, 918-919 (1996) (<HOLDING>); Commonwealth v. Whitmyer, 542 Pa. 545, holding that trial court properly suppressed evidence where officer did not possess articulable and reasonable grounds to suspect that defendant violated motor vehicle code the officer did not see defendant drive erratically commit a traffic violations or engage in any conduct indicating that he was under the influence of alcoholholding officer may search vehicle for weapons if officer has reasonable belief based on articulable facts that officer or another may be in dangerholding that a police officer may stop a driver where the officer has a reasonable and articulable suspicion regarding the commission of a civil traffic violationholding police officer had probable cause to believe defendant was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcoholholding that the arresting officer did not have probable cause to stop the defendant for obstructing traffic because there was no evidence of intent to impede or hinder traffic where the vehicle was only briefly stopped in the roadway and the officer approaching the vehicle from behind did not have to stop or drive around the defendants vehicle & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); see also State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 430, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, this Court has held that [\u0430] holding that juveniles request for parent is invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that a suspects invocation of the right to remain silent must be unequivocal to require that police questioning ceaserecognizing two aspects to assertion of fifth amendment rights 1 a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand request was made for an attorney and 2 the request was for assistance with a custodial interrogation not for subsequent hearings or proceedingsholding a juveniles request to speak to a probation officer is not a per se invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that an unequivocal invocation of the fifth amendment right to counsel must be presented in a manner that a reasonable police officer under similar circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for the presence of an attorney & \n\nargues that the trial court erred in denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because under these facts the search could not be justified as a search incident to arrest where the police had a preplanned intention to arrest him and search the car for investigation of other crimes. He also contends that the search was illegal because the items removed from the car (videotapes, computer disks, and a briefcase) were taken to a remote site (the police department) and \u201csearched\u201d at a later time. Pugh is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his postconviction claims unless (1) the motion, files, and records in the case conclusively show that he is entitled to no relief, or (2) the motion or a particular claim is legally insufficient nt v. State, 765 So.2d 903 (Fla. 5th DCA 2000) (<HOLDING>). It is not clear from this record why Pugh\u2019s holding police incident to arrest of occupant of automobile may search entire passenger compartment of vehicleholding that although search of passenger compartment was legal search of trunk was notrecognizing that a search incident to a lawful arrest permits a law enforcement officer to conduct a warrantless search of a container located in the area of the arrestees immediate controlholding that after making an arrest of the driver of a vehicle the police may search the passenger compartment of the vehicleholding that search of golf bag was not legal as search incident to arrest because it was not in passenger compartment of vehicle or otherwise within arrestees immediate control & \n\nsituation.\u201d Id. at 396-97. Nevertheless, the applicable standard is an objective one: \u201c[T]he question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d Id. at 397. In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him. This search revealed that Wilke degree of force is necessary, gratuitous acts against a person who has been seized might violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. Phelps v. Coy, 286 F.3d 295, 297, 301-02 (6th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Santos, 287 F.3d at 853 (explaining that holding that suspect was not in custody when officer handcuffed him for officer safety while transporting him to police stationholding that defendant was arrested when the police officer took physical custody of him by grabbing his arm and returned him to the hotel for detention thererecognizing the necessity of analyzing officer coys use of force against phelps in segments where coy arrested phelps placed him in handcuffs took him to the police station for booking and then beat him after he raised his leg in a manner that coy perceived to be a threat to another police officerholding the defendant was not under arrest when police asked him to go to the station and then offered him a ride because he did not have transportationholding that police executed an illegal arrest when they took a teenage suspect from his home and brought him in handcuffs to the police station for questioning & \n\n(citing Supreme Court cases noting the permissibility of limitations on speech, privacy, and self-incrimination protections where a citizen works for a government agency). As noted below, such limitations have been expressly considered when ascertaining the exercise of a right of intimate association. Here, the FBI\u2019s conduct regulations limited certain conduct on government property, including cohabitation or sleeping in a room at the FBI Academy other than one to which the NAT is assigned. (See Def.\u2019s Ex. 1 at 23.) A regulation that may implicate certain aspects of relationships between fellow NATs is rationally related to the government interest of instilling and maintaining a certain code of conduct.

If Boswell had authority over the case, whether joint or sole, then he had authority to consent to its search. We conclude that, bas that authority to consent to a search of property does not necessarily translate into authority to search specific containers. See Welch, 4 F.3d at 764 (\u201cThe shared control of \u2018host\u2019 property does not serve to forfeit the expectation of privacy in containers within that property.\u201d). However, in the cases in which we have held that there was not actual or apparent authority for a third party to consent to a search we have found that there was some fact that made it unreasonable for the officer to believe that the third party had authority over the container. See, e.g., id. at 764-65 (<HOLDING>). Here, Boswell\u2019s statement that he did not holding that it was unreasonable to believe that womans boyfriend had authority to consent to the search of her purse even though he had authority to consent to the search of the car in which it was keptholding that it was objectively reasonable for the police to conclude that the general consent to search the respondents car included consent to search a bag within that carholding that search of defendants purse which he carried was authorized by a warrant to search his personholding that the defendants consent to allow the officer to search her purse by way of holding it open for the officer was for consent to a limited view of the purses interior not to surrender possession for an unrestricted search and thus the officer exceeded the scope of the defendants consentholding that the question of whether police had a reasonable basis for finding that a third party had authority to consent to search is a question of law & \n\nCamacho Every citizen has a Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force during lawful arrests. See Kopec v. Tate, 361 F.3d 772, 776-78 (3d Cir.2004). \u201cViolation of the Fourth Amendment requires an intentional acquisition of physical control\u201d over the plaintiff. Brower v. County of Inyo, 489 U.S. 593, 596, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989). An excessive force claim under the Fourth Amendment requires that the police act \u201cthrough means intentionally applied\u201d to secure physical control of the plaintiff. Id. at 597, 109 S.Ct. 1378. The acquiring of physical control, or seizure, need not occur in the manner originally intended by the police, but it must result from volitional police activity performed for the purpose of seizing the plaintiff. Id. at 599, 109 S.Ct. 1378 (<HOLDING>); In re City of Phila. Litig., 158 F.3d 711, holding that the admission of evidence obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure is subject to a harmlesserror analysisholding that no seizure occurred where the defendant initially stopped in compliance with a police officers order but then drove off quickly before the police officer could reach the suspects carholding that evidence obtained by improper search or seizure is inadmissibleholding that a seizure results whenever an individual is stopped by the very instrumentality set in motion or put in place in order to achieve that resultholding that probable cause alone justifies a warrantless search or seizure of a vehicle lawfully parked in a public place & \n\nbetween investigative detentions and custody are legion. Thus, to discuss the issue here, it is necessary to use that investigative detention\/custody framework. Nevertheless, the use of the term investigative detention when discussing the Fifth Amendment should be interpreted as a non-custodial encounter under Miranda rather than a Fourth Amendment stop under Terry. 27 .

Knox, 839 F.2d 285, 296 (6th Cir.1988) (Jones, J., concurring) (concluding \"since a valid Terry seizure is, by definition, not a \u2018full seizure\u2019 \u2014 a term synonymous with \u2018arrest\u2019 \u2014 a person properly seized on reasonable and articulable suspicion for a brief investigatory detention could never be considered \u2018in custody\u2019 so long as the scope and duration of the Terry stop do not exceed h Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). 29 . If custody and investigative detention holding defendant was in custody under miranda while being detained under terryholding police officer knew that miranda rights are required to be given only to individuals who are in custody and although giving miranda warnings to a detainee may not automatically convert a terry stop into an arrest it is evidence that the nature of the detention has grown more seriousholding a defendant was not in custody for purposes of miranda after he consented to go to police headquartersholding miranda inapplicable because defendant not in custodyholding that defendant was not in miranda custody during knock and talk interview at his residence & \n\ncause to believe there is contraband somewhere in the car, but he does not know exactly where, he may search the entire car as well as any containers found therein\"). When the officer found the open container and removed it from the console, he was lawfully positioned to observe the methamphetamine, pipe, and digital scale when they came into plain view with removal of the bottle that had been sitting on top of them. The drug-related items were found in plain view during a valid warrantless search. They were lawfully seized. Cf. Harris v.

The focus, thus, was on \"prior conviction,\u201d not on what offenses the imprisonment \"resulted\u201d from. However, as we note, we do not need to rule on this question here. 3 .

Michigan, 501 U.S. 957, 994-95, 111 S.Ct. 2680, 115 L.Ed.2d 836 (1991) rejected the argument that a term of life imprisonment constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. See United States v. Fragoso, 978 F.2d 896, 903 (5th Cir.1992); see also Harmelin, 501 U.S. at 994-95, 111 S.Ct. 2680 (\u201cSevere, mandatory penalties may be cruel, but they are not unusual in the constitutional sense.\u201d). Lopez\u2019s Fifth Amendment argument is similarly without merit. See generally Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 230, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); accord United States v. Robinson, 344 Fed.Appx. 936, 940-41 (5th Cir.2009) (per mriam) (<HOLDING>). Finally, we have rejected the argument that a holding that impeachment by use of prearrest silence does not violate fifth or fourteenth amendmentsholding that exclusion of testimony as collateral and of speculative relevance did not violate defendants sixth and fourteenth amendment rightsholding that even if the minimum mandatory exceeds the statutory maximum the court must impose the minimum mandatoryholding references to a defendants lack of remorse violate the fifth eighth and fourteenth amendmentsholding that application of statutory mandatory minimum in 841b1a does not violate defendants fifth and fourteenth amendment rights & \n\nentities like GasPlus. See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>).

Although it was the defendant\/debtor that filed the notice of appeal, the appeal is considered to be the continuation of a proceeding \"against the debtor,\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1). See, e.g., Crowe Grp., Inc. v. Garner, 691 So.2d 1089, 1089 (Fla. 2d DCA 1993); Ingersoll-Rand Fin. Corp. v. Miller Mining Co., 817 F.2d 1424, 1426 (9th Cir.1987), 2 . U.S. Const, art.

We therefore conclude that Congress in tended for district court review to be contingent on an initial consideration of an application by the Secretary. See Saccacio v.

We find that the analysis set forth by Johnson is much more compelling. Because the 1997 Amendments do not impose a mandatory minimum sentence, see infra, petitioner\u2019s reliance on Smith is misplaced. Likewise, Meeks does not apply to this case, because it dealt with sentencing statutes and not parole guidelines. See generally Newland, 714 N.Y.S.2d at 631-32 (<HOLDING>). We agree that it is reasonable to interpret holding that an amendment passed two years into a 10year automatic extension period was not effective until the 10year extension period expired and stating that to hold otherwise would render the extension provision meaninglessholding that extension of a federal grand jurys term was within the discretionary powers of the district courtholding that the extension of meeks by the smith court was inappropriateholding that an amendment of restrictive covenants passed during the running of an automatic 10year extension period was not effective until the end of the 10year extension periodholding that a district court may not construe an untimely notice of appeal as a motion for extension of time & \n\nfor ten years and public policy forbids an attack based upon informalities and irregularities in the procedure which led to the adoption of the ordinance, when ... property owners affected by it have conformed to its provisions, and have fixed their status accordingly.\u201d (alterations, internal quotation marks, and citation omitted)). 11 .

Legros, 529 F.3d 470, 474 (2d Cir.2008). Contrary to Garcia\u2019s assertion, the application of a base offense level increase by the district court without jury findings does not violate Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Judicial factfinding that results in an offense level increase under the Guidelines, which are now advisory, see United States v.

The result is the same regardless whether our review is de novo or for plain error. According to the Court, Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury.

The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v.

The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\nAs the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals observed in Serrano, To what extent the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination bars the nonevi-dentiary use of immunized testimony is a difficult question. Neither Murphy [v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964)] nor Kastigar addressed this question, and lower courts have disagreed on the issue.

In addition to the guidance provided by the Supreme Court, several circuits have allowed equitable tolling based on mental illness. The First Circuit has established that mental incapacity is a suitable basis upon which to equitably toll a statute of limitations. See Mel\u00e9ndez-Arroyo v. Cutler-Hammer de P.R., Co., 273 F.3d 30, 39 (1st Cir.2001) (remanding for factual inquiry into whether plaintiffs mental state warranted equitable tolling); Nunnally, 996 F.2d at 5 (<HOLDING>); Oropallo v.

The relatively few courts that have addressed whether equitable tolling may be applied to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(e)(1) are virtually unanimous in holding that it may not. E.g., Roost v.

Blake argues that because Farrington commissioned the Harrigan map, that map constituted a representation by Farrington. However, commissioning another to create a map is not in itself a representation for equitable estoppel purposes. Rather, a commissioned map or document constitutes a representation in equitable estoppel where a party uses the document to induce another party to act. See, e.g., Slagle v. United States, 809 F.

First, RICO\u2019s statutory scheme resembles the EPCA more than the RCRA. Both RICO and the EPCA stand alone in grappling with a broad social issue, whereas the RCRA had a closely related statute on which the Court in Meghrig relied heavily. Second, as in both Porter and Mitchell, the government brought the suit rather than a private party like the Meghrig plaintiff, and Porter makes clear that district courts may have \u201ceven broader and more flexible\u201d equitable powers where the public interest is involved, 328 U.S. at 398, 66 S.Ct. 1086. This point has particular traction if the government is the only party that may seek equitable relief under RICO. See Religious Tech. Ctr. v.

V. Beazer challenges on two grounds the court\u2019s entry of judgment against it and in favor of Agrico on Agrico\u2019s equitable indemnification claim. First, Beazer contends that under controlling .South Carolina law, equitable indemnification lies only between parties having a contractual or special relationship that did not exist between Beazer and Agri-eo. Second, Beazer contends that equitable indemnity does not lie in favor of a party that itself is at fault in causing the injury for which indemnification is sought and that here Agrico was so at fault. We disagree on both points and find no error in this part of the court\u2019s judgment. Judgment was entered only for litigation costs incurred by Agrico in defending against Dent\u2019s 22, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1982) (<HOLDING>).

Taylor advances two arguments for why its payments from Advent came from funds held. in constructive trust. r First, Taylor claims that the payments came from wrongfully diverted Coastal funds which Advent held in constructive trust for Coastal\u2019s benefit. This claim is without merit. Under California law, Taylor has no right to seek the imposition of a constructive trust on Coastal\u2019s behalf. Sobel Bldg. Dev. Partners v. Broach (In re Sexton), 166 B.R. 421, 425 (Bankr.N.D.Cal.1994) (<HOLDING>). Second, Taylor claims that the payments came recognizing constructive trust as appropriate equitable remedyholding plans suit against law firm for constructive trust was a suit for appropriate equitable reliefholding that under california law a constructive trust may be sought only by the equitable owner of the trust res not by a creditor of the equitable ownerholding that the statute of limitations cannot bar appellants claim that a constructive trust should be imposed because a constructive trust is an equitable remedy and therefore not subject to the statuteholding that the beneficiary of a trust was not the real party in interest regarding rights owned by the trust & \n\nwe hold that it is not subject to an assertion of equitable estop-pel. As its name implies, equitable es-toppel embraces the notion that a party should not be permitted to profit by asserting rights against another when that party\u2019s own inequitable conduct has lulled the other into action or inaction detrimental to its position. See Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health & Rehab. Servs. v. S.A.P., 835 So.2d 1091, 1096-97 (Fla.2002) (citing State ex rel. Watson v. Gray, 48 So.2d 84, 87-88 (Fla.1950)). The doctrine has been most commonly held to preclude a defendant from raising a statute of limitations defense when the defendant\u2019s false representations mislead the plaintiff into failing to file suit within the limitations period.

Two caveats must accompany the League court\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute\u2019s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 351-52, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989) (<HOLDING>).

Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, it is not sufficient to state that because back pay involves monetary relief, it is necessarily legal in nature.

As a result, a Caldwell violation may be established where a technically accurate statement describing the state appellate review process nonetheless \u201cmisled the jury to minimize its role in the sentencing process.\u201d Driscoll v. Delo, 71 F.3d 701, 713 (8th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Given the limited nature of the Delaware holding that under the alabama death penalty statute because the judge did not consider the jurys recommendation the statute which forced the jury to sentence the defendant to death whenever aggravating circumstances existed was not unconstitutionalholding that the fact that a judge had ruled against the defendant is not a basis for finding the judge prejudicedholding that a defendant was not entitled to a relief under section 2255 when he asserted that the sentencing judge who was not the trial judge was influenced by the sentence imposed by the trial judge on a codefendantholding that private individuals who conspired with judge could be sued even though judge could notholding that prosecutor had violated caldwell by emphasizing that the trial judge could disregard the jurys recommendation of death even though no state judge had in fact ever done so & \n\nthe trial court erred when it failed to invoke the equitable principle of \u201csubrogation\u201d and declare that, to the extent MECO pays Subcontractors, either voluntarily or involutarily, MECO should be entitled to the security held by Subcontractors, mainly, the Subcontractors\u2019 mechanics\u2019 liens.

Quoting the Supreme Court, the panel instructed that: [I]n cases of bankruptcy, many incidental questions arise in the course of administering the bankrupt estate, which would ordinarily be pure cases at law, and in respect of their facts triable by jury, but, as belonging to the bankruptcy proceedings, they become cases over which the bankruptcy court, which acts as a court of equity, exercises exclusive control. Thus a claim of debt or damages against the bankrupt is investigated by chancery methods. Id. at 1503 (quoting Katchen v.

Simple excusable neglect is not sufficient. Moreover, a petitioner must diligently pursue his federal habeas claims; a claim of insufficient access to relevant law, such as AEDPA, is not enough to support equitable tolling. Id. (internal citations omitted). Mr. Bisner has not shown that any of the three circumstances discussed in Gibson, or any similar circumstances, exist. And the reasons Mr. Bisner offers for equitable tolling are simply inadequate. See id. (<HOLDING>); Marsh v. Soares, 223 F.3d 1217, 1220-21 (10th holding that aedpas statute of limitations is subject to equitable tolling only when an inmate diligently pursues his claims and demonstrates that the failure to timely file was caused by extraordinary circumstances beyond his controlholding that the general equitable tolling doctrine is read into every statute of limitationsholding petitioners alleged ignorance of aedpas statute of limitations is insufficient to warrant equitable tollingholding statute of limitations period defined in 28 usc 2244d is subject to equitable tollingholding that ignorance or misunderstanding of the law would not toll the running of the statute of limitations & \n\nagreement\u201d that \u201cachieved [plaintiffs] objective of obtaining injunctive relief to make [defendant\u2019s hotel] accessible\u201d).

The Ninth Circuit has held that an ADA plaintiff is a prevailing party if she: (1) \u201cachieve[s] a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d; and (2) that alteration is \u201cjudicially sanctioned.\u201d Jankey v. Poop Deck, 537 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir.2008). The second requirement can be met in many ways, including when a party enters into a legally enforceable agreement with the defendant. Barrios v.

The contract does not confer title upon him. He obtains that by the deed. It confers only the right to call for the legal title, to enforce a specific performance of the contract of sale. Accordingly, legal title to real property does not pass until a conveyance is made by deed; equitable title to the real property, however, passes to the purchaser at the time of sale. See, e.g., Annon v. Lucas, 155 W.Va. 368, 185 S.E.2d 343, 351 (1971) (<HOLDING>). In the absence of a true trustee-beneficiary holding that trespass to try title is the method for determining title to real propertyholding that a constructive trust is imposed in order to prevent injustice and that such a trust may be imposed when the circumstances show that it would be inequitable for the holder of legal title to retain the propertyholding that debtor as grantor and trustee of a trust that held legal title to the property held a sufficient equitable interest in the property to claim it as exempt homestead where she resided on the property prepetition with the intent to maintain it as her primary residenceholding that the legal title holders to real property held it in constructive trust for the equitable title holder who was entitled to the real property based on an earlier contractholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real property & \n\nat any time after an action for equitable distribution has been filed and prior to the final judgment of equitable distribution, enter orders declaring what is separate property and dividing part of the marital property between the parties.

Lower courts generally allow hearsay evidence during capital sentencing if it has sufficient indicia of reliability, though some courts require confrontation rights when testimonial statements are involved.","COMBINED_RETRIEVED_DOCS":"life and death for Fields. Beyond Officer January\u2019s and Tichenor\u2019s testimony, the list goes on and on. III. Conclusion Sherman Lamont Fields was sentenced to death based on testimony that he was never able to confront. That is precisely the evil that the Confrontation Clause was meant to protect against. That troubling fact cannot be remedied by categorizing the testimony as speaking to selection as opposed to eligibility factors. The jury\u2019s difficulty in agreeing on a sentence and the number of mitigating factors found highlight how artificial that distinction can be. I would find that the Confrontation Clause applies to capital sentencing as it is structured under the FDPA and remand this case for resentencing. 1 . Compare Proffitt v. Wainwright, 685 F.2d 1227, 1254 (11th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Mills, 446 F.Supp.2d 1115, holding that the right to crossexamine adverse witnesses applies to capital sentencing hearingsrecognizing that the federal rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing hearingsholding that the confrontation clause applies only to trials and not to sentencing hearingsholding no right to crossexamine in grand jury proceedingsholding that the right applies at capital sentencing in particular & \n\nCourt also found that the cause of the delay was the government\u2019s failure to follow up on its proposed plea offers and Holub\u2019s failure to communicate his rejections of the offers to the government. Ibid. The Court further found that Holub had not been prejudiced by the delay and that the government had no history of delaying trials in that area. Id. at 30. For those reasons, the Court held that dismissal without prejudice was appropriate. Its holding is not an abuse of discretion. VII. Next, the defendants challenge their sentences on various grounds. One of Wiley\u2019s contentions\u2014that hearsay introduced at the sentencing hearing violated his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment\u2014 was disposed of by our decision in United States v.

United States, 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). In Bruton, the Supreme Court held that the defendant was deprived of his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment when his codefendant\u2019s post-arrest confession, which incriminated the defendant, was admitted at their joint trial. In reaching its decision, the Court acknowledged that there was no recognized exception to the hearsay rule before it. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 128 n.3, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 480 n.3, 88 S. Ct. at statements admissible because there was sufficient indicia of reliability). Moreover, defendant was able to confront and cross-examine Rinaldi, who testified about the statements.

The best practice is for attorneys to make both objections when applicable. The failure to do so in this case is not particularly egregious; because the trial court concluded that the testimony was not hearsay, it seems unlikely that the trial court would have sustained an objection based on the Confrontation Clause. Regardless, we agree with the State that Officer Thompson\u2019s testimony was not \u201ctestimonial hearsay,\u201d the type of hearsay barred pursuant to the Confrontation Clause. See Davis v.

Huether also has prior experience with law enforcement \u2014 he was arrested after being questioned by law enforcement in Montana. At a minimum, these factors sh cord here supports the district court\u2019s decision declining to suppress the evidence. Moreover, the record shows Huether, without hesitation, answered the questions relating to the materials in his computer. B. Confrontation Clause Huether contends the district court erred in admitting testimony from Agent Erickson, which repeated the conclusions of a report prepared by those at NCMEC, and testimony from Agent Helderop concerning the hard drives\u2019 and compact discs\u2019 origin. Huether did not raise this issue in the district court; accordingly, we re , 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (<HOLDING>). According to Huether, Agents Erickson\u2019s and holding that any confrontation right is found in the fourteenth amendments due process clause not the confrontation clause of the sixth amendmentholding forensic laboratory experts statement that substance was cocaine is testimonial for sixth amendment confrontation clause purposesholding that the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial hearsayholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statementsholding that bureau of criminal apprehension bca laboratory report identifying a substance as cocaine was testimonial and implicated defendants right to confrontation & \n\n254 S.W.2d at 1011. Though DeToto\u2019s affidavit does not explicitly state that Roberts refused to provide an affidavit, we believe the affidavit implicitly makes this contention through DeToto\u2019s statement that he had spoken with Roberts and that Roberts had denied making the statements. 36 . Because we have found, based on the reasoning already discussed in this section, that appellant\u2019s affidavits are not deficient, we need not address whether appellant\u2019s affidavits are sufficient on some other basis. More specifically, we need not consider whether Roberts\u2019 alleged statements to Clinton are admissible through Clinton because they constitute an admission by party-opponent. See Tex.R.

CPPA With respect to appellant\u2019s CPPA claims, this court has previously addressed the question whether the CPPA applies to landlord-tenant relations. See Gomez v. Independence Mgmt. of Delaware, Inc., 967 A.2d 1276, 1286 (D.C.2009) (<HOLDING>). In Gomez, we found that although the Council holding that apprendi does not apply retroactivelyholding that the cppa does not apply to landlordtenant relationsholding that the confrontation clause does not apply to the sentencing hearingholding that 1447c does not apply to counselholding that title ii does not apply to the states & \n\ndisagree.

This Court in Globe v. State, 877 So.2d 663 (Fla.2004), addressed a Confrontation Clause issue and held that the clause was not implicated where Globe and his codefendant, Busby, speaking together to a law enforcement officer, gave a joint taped statement in which they admitted killing a fellow inmate and where the tape was played at trial. The Court reasoned thusly: We have previously recognized that admissions by acquiescence or silence do not implicate the Confrontation Clause. See Nelson v. State, 748 So.2d 237 (Fla.1999); see also United States v. Kehoe, 310 F.3d 579, 590-91 (8th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 2112, holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were madeholding that an absent witnesss statements are admissible under the confrontation clause only where the declarant is unavailable and only where the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamineholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statementsholding that any confrontation right is found in the fourteenth amendments due process clause not the confrontation clause of the sixth amendmentholding that the confrontation clause did not guarantee the defendant the right to crossexamine a speaker whose statements were imputed to the defendant as adoptive admissions of a party opponent & \n\nprejudice by his counsel\u2019s failure to submit jury instructions as he did not demonstrate that there was an instructional error or that there was a reasonable probability of a different result had his counsel submitted jury instructions. Moreover, in light of the aggravating circumstances in this ease - the emotional harm to the victim, that the molestation occurred over a long period of time, the exploitation of children other than the victim, Liska\u2019s pri- or felony convictions for child molestation and motorcycle theft, and Liska\u2019s long history of taking pornographic pictures of nude boys - it is unlikely that Liska\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to present additional mitigating evidence, if indeed there was any, was prejudicial. See Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 836 (9th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); Pizzuto, 280 F.3d at 968-69 (holding that holding that apprendi does not apply to state capital sentencing schemes where judges are required to find certain aggravating circumstances before imposing a death sentenceholding that the cause and prejudice standard applied to defendants failure to object to his career offender classification at sentencingholding that prejudice was not shown where there was overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that where the aggravating circumstances are overwhelming it is particularly difficult to show prejudice at sentencing due to the alleged failure to present mitigation evidencerecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\n3553(e)[,] asserting the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government; or (2) the defendant meets the \u201csafety valve\u201d criteria set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u2019 Otherwise, post-Booker sentencing courts lack discretion to depart below relevant statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d In this case, the gov 606, 2008 WL 946065 (5th Cir.2008) (noting that alleged violations of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment are subject to harmless error analysis). 4 .

We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling and thus deny relief on this issue. Psychological Mitigation Evidence In Spann v. State, this Court held: Mitigating evidence must be considered and weighed when it is contained anywhere in the record, to the extent it is uncontroverted and believable. This requirement applies with equal force when the defendant asks the court not to consider mitigating evidence .... (Citation omitted.) The sentencing court must \u201cexpressly evaluate in its written order each mitigating circumstance proposed by the defendant.\u201d 857 So.2d 845, 857 (Fla.2003) (quoting Rogers v. State, 783 So.2d 980, 995 (Fla.2001)); see also Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis in original). Where a trial court holding that the trier of fact must be allowed to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidenceholding that defendants relatively minor participation in the crime is a mitigating factor that sentencer must considerholding that sentencing scheme that permitted a limited range of mitigating evidence was unconstitutional because the eighth and fourteenth amendments require that the sentencer not be precluded from considering as a mitigating factor any aspect of a defendants character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than deathholding for a unanimous court that sentencer in capital case must consider an extensive list of nonstatutory mitigating factorsholding that a sentencer may not refuse to consider as a matter of law any relevant mitigating evidence & \n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which was decided a few days before Wade\u2019s guilty plea, prevented the district court from enhancing her sentence based on facts not found by a jury. The district court overruled the objection, calculated a sentencing range of 18 to 24 months based on the total loss amount, recognized the advisory nature of the Guidelines, and sentenced Wade to 18 months imprisonment. Wade appeals, arguing that the district court violated the \u201cconstitutional\u201d holding of Booker and violated her right to due process by treating the Guidelines as advisory in sentencing her for conduct that occurred pre-Booker. We review Wade\u2019s constitutional challenges to her sentence de novo. See United States v. Mashek, 406 F.3d 1012, 1016 (8th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). If the sentence passes those challenges, we holding that confrontation clause claims are reviewed de novoholding that a legal conclusion on a motion to suppress is reviewed de novoholding that a circuit courts entry of summary judgment is reviewed de novoholding that legal challenges to a district courts sentence continue to be reviewed de novo postbookerholding that we review constitutional challenges de novo & \n\nargument is that because these factors restate the factors charged in the indictment, they are not \u201cadditional non-statutory aggravators.\u201d United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 321 (4th Cir. 2003) (emphasis added). Defendant urges the Court to interpret the Fourth Circuit\u2019s use of the word \u201cadditional\u201d to mean \u201ca factor unrelated to the Defendant\u2019s crime of conviction.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that the FDPA expressly permits juries to consider statutory aggravators as well as \u201cany other aggravating factor for which notice has been given.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592(c). In other words, the FDPA empowers jurors to consider nonstatutory ag-gravators that are appropriately noticed. Accordingly, the Court rejects Defendant\u2019s argument that allowing 689, at *6 (Ala.

The Court reasoned that \u201cthe co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule [Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) ] is firmly enough rooted in our jurisprudence that, under this Court\u2019s holding in Roberts, a court need not inde1 pendently inquire into the reliability of such statements.\u201d Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775. Brist is therefore correct that the Court has rejected Bour-jaily\u2019s underlying reasoning by now requiring courts to conduct a separate Confrontation Clause analysis for out-of-court \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, even when the statements at issue otherwise satisfy a firmly-rooted hearsay exception. See, e.g., Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2540, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (<HOLDING>); Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 holding that confrontation clause issues are subject to harmless error analysisholding confrontation clause violations subject to harmless error analysisholding that certificates of analysis produced by forensic scientists who conducted a chemical analysis of drugs seized from the defendant are subject to confrontation clause challenge wjhether or not they qualify as business or official recordsrecognizing that statements admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule may be inadmissible when tested against the confrontation clause because confrontation clause analysis differs from hearsay rule analysisholding that admission of business records does not violate the confrontation clause under roberts & \n\nof the crime for which the sentence is being imposed. I think that is different. I think that is different in its thrust and effect; and accordingly, it is not to be applied in this case because to do so would be increasing the punishment for a crime in violation of the ex post facto prohibition in the Constitution. Neither the government nor Mr. Nichols has directly taken issue with this ruling, but it has been raised in the brief of the amici who were present at and took part in the sentencing proceedings. Amici argue that MVRA is not punitive in nature and therefore does not implicate the ex post facto prohibition. The government also suggests we can apply the MVRA, but Mr. Nichols takes the opposite view relying on United States v. Siegel, 153 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (11th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>) (citing holdings or dicta of the Second, holding that retroactive application of mvra does not violate the ex post facto clause because restitution is not a criminal punishmentholding that the ex post facto clause prohibited retroactive application of the mvra because before the mvra became effective the victim and witness protection act authorized but did not compel district courts to order restitutionholding that application of guidelines did not violate the ex post facto clause because rico offense was a straddle crime that continued before and after the effective date of the guidelinesholding ex post facto clause barred application of mvra to defendant whose criminal conduct occurred before the effective date of the statuteholding that the ex post facto clause has no application to deportation & \n\nDefendants \u2014 making it a likelier reference to the other Defendants who were on trial. The Government notes that the Court in Gray suggested \u201c[m]e and a few other guys [beat the victim]\u201d as an alternative to the improper redaction in the phrase \u201c[m]e, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys [beat the victim].\u201d 523 U.S. at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151. But the language \u201ca few other guys\u201d is less specific than \u201cothers\u201d as stated at trial, especially when coupled with Alexander\u2019s identification of \u201cthe other individuals\u201d as the four other Defendants just a few minutes earlier in Hodous\u2019s testimony. Another issue implicates the Confrontation Clause. The analyses in Richardson, Gray, and Vasilakos assume the presence of a limiting instruction. See, e.g., Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (<HOLDING>). Here, no limiting instruction was given to holding that where a defendants name is replaced with a neutral pronoun as long as identification of the defendant is clear or inculpatory only by reference to evidence other than the redacted confession and a limiting instruction is given to the jury there is no bruton violationholding that when all references to the defendant in a eodefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the clause was not violated by a redacted confession with a proper limiting instructionholding that when all references to the defendant in a codefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the confession did not violate the confrontation clause because it was redacted to eliminate not only the defendants name but any reference to his or her existence & \n\nbuy. Agent Snedeker and Pope discussed in detail the location of the drug buy, the price, the quantity, and the availability of drugs for future purchase. Considering these factors, the statements made by Pope to Agent Snedeker were not testimonial in nature. Therefore, it is immaterial whether the declarant was unavailable or whether the defendant had an adequate opportunity to cross examine the declarant. Furthermore, the statements made by Pope to Agent Snedeker fall outside the long- rt intended to overrule its precedent regarding the admissibility of co-conspirator statements. Any ambiguity regarding the admissibility of co-conspirator statements in the wake of Crawford has been firmly resolved by the Fourth Circuit. See United States v. Sullivan, 455 F.3d 248, 258 (4th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Canady, 139 holding statements by coconspirator nontestimonial and thus admissibleholding testimony admissible as showing context of relationship with coconspirator prior to conspiracyholding that bruton does not apply to nontestimonial codefendant statementsholding that voluntary statements to police initiated by witness are not interrogation and therefore are nontestimonialholding that driving records were nontestimonial & \n\nthat when he interviewed Lewis she never mentioned anyone besides Slovik throwing pool balls, but she did state that Featherstone pushed Slovik to the ground and then kicked him, and that Buckley-Stoffel and Featherstone did not plan to inform the police about either that or the parking lot fight. 4 . After briefing, oral argument, and publication of an opinion in this case, the State argued for the first time in a petition for rehearing that Slovik did not sufficiently raise a Confrontation Clause argument in state court proceedings. Moreover, Slovik apparently cannot return to state court to raise a Confrontation Clause claim because he failed to raise the argument in his original state habeas petition. See In re Clark, 5 Cal.4th 750, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729, 760 (1993) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, Slovik is no longer subject to holding that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to review the weight of evidence holding that district court must resolve all claims for relief premised on alleged constitutional violations which are raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus whether habeas relief is granted or deniedholding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that absent justification for the failure to present all known claims in a single timely petition for writ of habeas corpus successive andor untimely petitions will be summarily deniedholding that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to review the weight of evidence & \n\n"}

The plain language of this statute allows plaintiffs who successfully bring suit under RICO to recover costs and attorney\u2019s fees. It does not, however, provide a remedy for defendants who successfully defend against a RICO suit. Although Hunt argues that case law compels us to find in his favor, the two cases he cites have nothing to do with a defendant receiving costs or fees under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). See Brandt v.

Thus, the criminal defendants\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights weigh heavily in favor of a stay to avoid prejudice to the other civil parties, especially The Hartford. See Holden Roofing, Inc., 2007 WL 1173634, at *1 (finding that if depositions were permitted in a civil case related to a pending criminal ease, a significant portion of questions posed to the defendants would likely result in the defendants asserting their Fifth Amendment rights, which weighed heavily in favor of a stay). The civil action should also be stayed because Hoeffner, a criminal defendant, seeks discovery as a civil plaintiff. As a matter of equity and public policy, a criminal defendant may not institute a civil action to obtain discovery relating to the criminal case. See Campbell, 307 F.2d at 487 (<HOLDING>); see also Agran v. City of New York, 95 Civ. holding that liberal civil discovery procedures are not a back door to information otherwise beyond reach under the criminal discovery rulesrecognizing that while summary judgment is improper if the nonmovant is not afforded a sufficient opportunity for discovery it is the nonmovants responsibility to inform the district court of the need for discovery by filing an affidavit pursuant to rule 56f of the federal rules of civil procedure or filing a motion requesting additional discoveryholding discovery rules apply to civil forfeiture proceedingsholding that discovery under the federal rules of civil procedure is broad in scope and freely permittedholding that a discovery exception to a statute of limitation applies only to the discovery of facts not discovery of the law & \n\nSome of the prerequisites for review by extraordinary writ are arguably met here. The district court\u2019s order brings about a serious intrusion into Vidrine\u2019s privacy and his mental and emotional health, and the question presented is a novel issue of importance affecting privacy interests and the contours of the psychotherapist-patient privilege. In addition, the district court\u2019s use of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35 was likely a \u201cclear abuse of discretion.\u201d E.g., Schlagenhauf, 379 U.S. at 109-12, 85 S.Ct. 234. Vidrine did not put his mental or physical health \u201cin controversy\u201d as a disputed merits issue, Fed.R.CivP. 35(a)(1); rather, his mental health is only relevant to whether he may be made to sit for a deposition, cf, e.g., Schlagenhauf, 379 U.S. at 118-19, 121, 85 S.Ct. 234 (<HOLDING>); Acosta v. Tenneco Oil Co., 913 F.2d 205, 209 holding that rule 35 does not permit sweeping examinations of a party who has not affirmatively put into issue his own mental or physical condition by asserting his mental or physical condition either in support of or in defense of a claim and that mere relevance to the case is insufficientholding that a medical impairment is deemed severe when alone or in combination with other medically determinable physical or mental impairments it significantly limits an individuals physical or mental ability to do basic work activitiesholding that emotional distress requires a showing of either physical symptoms or mental illnessholding that evidence of an impaired mental condition that does not rise to floridas definition of insanity is not admissibleholding testimony about plaintiffs mental and physical state before treatment by physician was relevant & \n\nfor access services they admitted to ordering and receiving. Plaintiffs now argue that the court erred in finding that \u201cnone of defendants subscribed to plaintiffs\u2019 switched access services by submitting an Access Order as prescribed in the tariffs\u201d and in failing to consider issues of material fact that may establish that TNCI, Global Crossing, and Sprint are liable under the constructive ordering doctrine. The court will consider plaintiffs\u2019 second contention first. STANDARD The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not mention motions to reconsider. The Eighth Circuit has instructed courts to consider such motions either under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b). Sanders v. Clemco Indus., 862 F.2d 161, 168 (8th Cir.1988); see also Schoffstall v. Henderson, 223 F.3d 818, 827 (8th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Broadway v.

Defendants filed a Suggestion of Mootness [Doc. # 77] on June 6, 2000. Attached is the Affidavit of David C. Lanier. Mr. Lanier is the registrar at UNC, and he testifies that Ms. Jennings has graduated from UNC. (Lanier Aff. \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs have not responded. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), courts can look beyond the pleadings to determine a matter on standing. Smith v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 290 F.3d 201, 205 (4th Cir.2002). Only Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) converts to a summary judgment when additional evidence is examined. Id. 5 . If preemption is found, Plaintiffs will be precluded from suing officials in their individual capacities under Title IX. See Kinman v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist., 171 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir. 1999) (<HOLDING>). 6 . The Supreme Court recognizes that Federal holding title ix does not support an action against official in an individual capacityholding that in a bivens action service upon employee in his official capacity does not amount to service in his individual capacityholding that a claim for damages exists in an action to enforce title ixholding that a claim for retaliation does not lie under title ixholding that the doctrine of qualified immunity does not protect a government official who is sued in an official capacity under title vii because title vii does not impose personal liability & \n\nfactors, the Burnet court relied on Snedigar, which had in turn relied on Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. 223. The Snedigar court\u2019s holding (with the Burnet court\u2019s deletions italicized) is as follows: We . . . hold that when a trial judge chooses one of the harsher remedies allowable under CR 37(b), the reasons for that choice should he clearly stated on the record. We further hold that when the most severe sanction of default or dismissal is ordered, it must be apparent from the record that the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed, and whether it found the Associated Mortgage due process factors [of willfulness and substantial prejudice] to be present. 53 Wn. App. at 487 (emphasis added); Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. at 228-29 (<HOLDING>). The Burnet court also cited a line of cases holding that a trial court had the authority to impose a default judgment as a sanction for violating a rule 16 scheduling order pursuant to rule 37b2 stating we agree with the basic premise that a default sanction can under certain circumstances be an appropriate response to a violation of a rule 16 order after all the express terms of rule 37 permit a trial court to impose sanctions when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discoveryholding that district courts order granting motion for default judgment was erroneous because a default judgment cannot be entered until the amount of damages has been ascertained holding that a postjudgment contempt sanction for refusal to obey orders whether it is characterized as a civil or a criminal sanction is immediately appealable as a final order under 1291recognizing that courts have discretion to exclude evidence as a sanction for violation of a discovery orderholding that the sanction of a default judgment authorized by cr 37b2c is a harsh remedy which should only be granted where there has been a willful or deliberate refusal to obey a discovery order which refusal substantially prejudices the opponents ability to prepare for trial & \n\nJudge Byrd\u2019s July 13, 2007 order, imposing sanctions under Super. Ct. Dom. Rel. R. 11 for his filing of the 2007 Complaint for Custody. The sanctions against both Upson and Merkle were imposed in the form of an attorney\u2019s fee award to Wallace, who proceeded pro se in both matters. We address the two appeals together because both require the resolution of a common issue: whether a trial court can impose a sanction of attorney\u2019s fees, pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent power or pursuant to Super. Ct. Dom. Rel. R. 11, to be awarded to an attorney appearing pro se as a litigant. We hold that it cannot. Sanctions Under Superior Court Domestic Relations Rule 11 Super. Ct. Dom. Rel. R. 11 sanctions are available when a \u201cpleading, motion, or other paper\u201d that is sig 3d 1365, 1375 (Fed.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). We are persuaded by the foregoing authorities holding that a defendant proceeding pro se is bound by same rules as party represented by counsel and a court cannot allow pro se litigant lower standard of performanceholding that the language of fed rcivp 37 a rule that allows for sanctions regarding discovery violations does not allow a pro se lawyer to receive fees for his own timeholding that a motion for rule 37 sanctions is dispositiveholding that new jersey rule patterned on fed r civ p 11 precludes a pro se attorney litigant from receiving attorneys fees because such fees are not actually incurredholding that california rule modeled almost word for word on rule 11 of the federal rules of civil procedure does not allow a pro se attorney litigant to recover sanctions in the form of an award of attorneys fees & \n\nonly relies on a self-serving affidavit. Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (stating that \u201csummary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition\u201d). The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nnot under Rule 21 but Rule 42(b) and effects merely a \u201cseparation of claims in an action in which multiple parties have been joined.\u201d) (emphasis omitted). The confusion that can arise from loose talk of \u201cseverance\u201d where in fact only a separation of claims has occurred, together with the impact the distinction can have on appellate jurisdiction, occasionally has provoked judicial frustration. See Spencer, White & Prentis, Inc. v. Pfizer, 498 F.2d 358, 359 (2 d Cir.1974) (speaking of the \u201ctangle of Rules 21, 42(b) [and] 54(b)\u201d). In the context of removal to federal court in diversity jurisdiction, the mere fact that an order of a state court purports to have \u201csevered\u201d claims generally is insufficient to make a case removable. See Nolan v. Boeing Co., 919 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v. Unijax, Inc., 625 F.2d 54, 56 holding that diversitydefeating parties were not severed from a case so as to permit removal to federal court where article 1038 of the louisiana code of civil procedure pursuant to which the severance was made authorizes separate trials rather than a true severanceholding the lumpsum payment of a severance benefit to be evidence of lack of an administrative schemeholding that a plan providing severance pay for reduction in work force simply did not contemplate the effect of a sale of a business on the availability of severance payholding that severance pay policy was part of employment contractholding that death qualification of jury is not of itself grounds for severance of a noncapital defendant & \n\nparty subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest. A \u201cnecessary\u201d party must be joined if feasible \u2014 if they are \u201csubject to service of process\u201d and would \u201cnot deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 19(a). If a court determines that a party is not \u201cnecessary\u201d under Rule 19(a), \u201cjoinder, as well as further analysis, is unnecessary.\u201d Local 670, et al. v. Int\u2019l Union, et al., 822 F.2d 613, 618 (6th Cir.1987). The burden is on the moving party to establish that a party is necessary for purposes of Rule 19(a). Marshall v. Navistar Intern. Transp. Corp., 168 F.R.D. 606, 611 (E.D.Mich.1996); 5C Charles A. Wright and Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1359 (3d ed.2013) (<HOLDING>). \u201cThe moving party may satisfy this burden holding that a motion to continue a hearing on a postjudgment motion was ineffective to extend the period for the trial court to rule on the motion absent the express consent of the partiesholding that the burden is on the plaintiff to allege facts sufficient to establish jurisdictionrecognizing burdenrecognizing that the burden is on a party making a rule 12b7 motion to establish that missing parties are necessary or indispensable to the actionholding that the burden is on the plaintiff & \n\nIn addition, to the extent Olmstead has argued that the court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because he was proceeding without counsel, a defendant\u2019s pro se status in civil litigation generally will not excuse mistakes he makes regarding procedural mies. See McNeil v.

An aggrieved party, including a criminal defendant, remains free to seek enforcement of the terms of a release in civil court.

As a general matter, a \u00a7 1983 action may be brought in either a state or federal forum. Thus, conceivably, concurrent state and federal jurisdiction could exist over the Marcuses\u2019 damages claim. In the present case, however, the state action is criminal in nature and was initiated by the State of Pennsylvania in its criminal court. Pennsylvania law makes no provision by which the Marcuses could raise their \u00a7 1983 claim in a state criminal forum. See Hutchins v. Commonwealth, Pa.

Courts apply the harmless error standard when the overall charge, taken as a whole, fairly presents the law, and the jury's decision likely was not affected by the specific misinstruction. This is assessed under the Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18 (1967), standard in constitutional cases.","COMBINED_RETRIEVED_DOCS":"instruction notes that if the defendant is not also charged with malice murder, the words in parentheses should be omitted. See id. In this case, although Appellant was not indicted for malice murder, the trial court included the parenthetical words in its jury instruction on felony murder. The court also charged that if the jury found that Appellant was \u201cguilty of the offense of murder with malice af n that the State had to prove malice aforethought for Appellant to be found guilty of felony murder made it harder for the State to make its case, since malice aforethought is not an element of felony murder (although it is not inconsistent with that crime). Instructional errors that could only benefit a defendant are harmless. See Sanders v. State, 283 Ga. 372, 375 (659 SE2d 376) (2008) (<HOLDING>); Brown v.

Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v.

State, 599 So.2d 1362, 1364 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992), the court held that a jury instruction based on Faison was not applicable when a charge alleges false imprisonment. The Chaeld court held: This so-call Faison instruction must be given upon the defendant\u2019s request whenever the state charges kidnapping with the intent to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony under \u00a7 787.01(l)(a)2. It has no application when the charge alleges that the defendant kidnapped the victim with any of the other specific intentions identified in \u00a7 787(l)(a)l, 3 or 4. See Bedford v. State, 589 So.2d 245, 251 (Fla.1991) (<HOLDING>). Because the Faison instruction is implicated holding that the fatal injury to a murder victim may be considered as satisfying the bodily injury component of the capital felony of kidnapping with bodily injuryholding that defendant charged with conspiracy to manufacture marijuana and possessing marijuana with intent to distribute was not entitled to specific buyerseller instruction even though support for such instruction existed because court gave a complete instruction reciting all the elements of conspiracyholding that a defendant charged with kidnapping with the intent to inflict bodily harm upon or terrorize the victim is not entitled to a faison instructionholding that the first amendment prohibits criminal sanctions for true statements made with an intent to inflict harmholding that life sentence imposed for kidnapping with bodily injury of 14yearold victim was not cruel and unusual punishment even though bodily injury was slight given circumstances attendant upon offense & \n\nthat? (Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter.

There was no prose-cutorial holding almost any improper argument may be cured by an instruction to disregardholding improper admission of extrinsic evidence may be cured by adequate limiting instructionholding an error re garding the element of a crime may be cured through further instruction to the juryholding that a jury instruction directing the verdict on one element deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination on every element of the charged offense and thus constituted structural errorholding omission in the jury instruction of element of offense requires a new trial & \n\nof the sudden emergency instruction, was appropriate considering the trial court\u2019s finding that the situation lacked spontaneity. Id. In the case before us, a jury could find that a vehicle suddenly spinning out of control immediately ahead of defendant-driver created a spontaneous reaction not necessarily present when vehicles are stopped in the road ahead of a driver who is able to see the stopped vehicles before the collision. Based upon our de novo review, we conclude that the rear-end collision instruction amounted to harmless error and that the sudden emergency jury instruction was correctly given. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred in granting the motion for new trial. See Lieberman v. Bliss-Doris Realty Associates, L.P., 819 A.2d 666, 673 (R.I.2003) (<HOLDING>). Conclusion We vacate the order of the holding that trial judge should have granted new trial rather than judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the judge could not know in what order the jury reached its inconsistent verdictsholding that a motion to intervene filed after final judgment should have been grantedholding that the presentation of a new theory does not constitute the presentation of a new issue on which a jury trial should be granted as of right under rule 38bholding that where jury has been properly instructed counsel is not ineffective for failing to object to an instructionholding new trial should not have been granted because jury was properly instructed & \n\nin their closing arguments and may advance all legitimate arguments and draw logical inferences from the evidence. See McArthur, 801 So.2d at 1039^40. Moreover, prosecutors in specific are not limited to a robotic presentation on behalf of the State. See Diaz v. State, 797 So.2d 1286, 1287 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). However, \u201c[a] criminal trial is a neutral arena wherein both sides place evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration; the role of counsel in clos ing argument is to assist the jury in analyzing that evidence, not to obscure the jury\u2019s view with personal opinion, emotion, and nonrecord evidence.\u201d Ruiz, 743 So.2d at 4. Unfortunately, prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument is neither a new nor fading phenomenon. See, e.g., Crew v. State, 146 So.3d 101, 111 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014) (<HOLDING>); Freeman v. State, 717 So.2d 105, 106 (Fla. holding that the cumulative effect of the prosecutors comments which as seen above are welldocumented errors denied appellant a fair trialholding that cumulative effect of multiple errors worked to deprive defendant of fair trial although some errors standing alone would be subject to plain error review and others might be harmlessholding that although neither of the trial courts errors when considered in isolation were necessarily sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial the cumulative effect of the errors created sufficient prejudice to deny defendant a fair trialholding that plain error is the appropriate standard of review when a defendant objects to a prosecutors comments at trial does not move for a mistrial and then on appeal argues that the comments deprived him of a fair trialholding that a number of errors may be deemed harmful in their cumulative effect & \n\npretrial proceedings, Defendant was repeatedly advised of the risks he faced by choosing to proceed without counsel. Nevertheless, Defendant unequivocally maintained throughout the proceedings, orally and in writing, that he wished to represent himself. Defendant argues that certain technical errors, specifically a typographical error in the indictment and the prosecutor\u2019s initial misstatement of the maximum sentence at the arraignment, render his conviction invalid. Without a showing of prejudice, these errors do not constitute grounds for reversal. See United States v. Romero, 640 F.2d 1014, 1015 (9th Cir.1981). Defendant has not demonstrated prejudice; the technical errors were promptly corrected. See Garland v. Washington, 232 U.S. 642, 645-46, 34 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed. 772 (1914) (<HOLDING>).

Moreover, in light of the aggravating circumstances in this ease - the emotional harm to the victim, that the molestation occurred over a long period of time, the exploitation of children other than the victim, Liska\u2019s pri- or felony convictions for child molestation and motorcycle theft, and Liska\u2019s long history of taking pornographic pictures of nude boys - it is unlikely that Liska\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to present additional mitigating evidence, if indeed there was any, was prejudicial.

Lockhart v. List, 542 Pa. 141, 148, 665 A.2d 1176, 1179 (1995) (<HOLDING>). \u00b6 12 For all of the foregoing reasons, I holding that unless an erroneous instruction was unlikely to have changed the result of the trial a reviewing court cannot say that giving the instruction was harmless errorholding that in reviewing a jury instruction this court must review the entire instruction and look at all the evidence on the record to determine whether there was error and whether that error prejudiced the complaining partyholding that when no objection was made to jury instruction evidence to support finding based on instruction should be assessed in light of the instruction givenholding that it was not error for the court to give a substantive new instruction to the jury after deliberations began where the instruction was given in court with the defendant and his counsel presentholding that a court reviewing an informal adjudication must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment & \n\nis sufficient\u201d (citation and punctuation omitted)). From her testimony, we know that Ms. Wright and Martin were on the floor in the den when they \u201cstarted to have sex.\u201d Under ordinary circumstances, the phrase, \u201cstarted to have sex,\u201d can imply foreplay in anticipation of penetration. However, under the extreme circumstances described by Ms. Wright, who wa pite the evidence of rape described above, the jury was unauthorized to find that a rape had occurred because Ms. Wright did not report the rape early in her interactions with investigators. We find this argument unpersuasive for four reasons. First, a rape conviction is not unauthorized under the law simply because the victim chooses not to report the rape immediately. See Watson v. State, 235 Ga. 461, 463 (2) (219 SE2d 763) (1975) (<HOLDING>). Second, the jury might well have considered holding that a letter written by a thirteenyearold victim two years after her alleged rape was admissible reasoning that the issue of the twoyear delay was one of credibility not admissibilityholding that a delay in reporting an alleged rape goes to the victims credibility which is solely a jury questionholding proximate cause almost always a question solely for the juryholding that the thirteenyearold victims twomonth delay in reporting her rape is explained by and completely consistent with the all too common circumstances surrounding sexual assault on minors fear of disbelief by others and threat of further harm from the assailantholding issues of fact in dispute are solely for the jury & \n\nuntil April 1998 the deadline for serious and severe nonattainment areas to submit their attainment demonstrations. See 64 Fed.Reg. at 70,398. Because not all SIPs contain MVEBs and because of the delay in the submission and approval of attainment demonstrations that do contain such budgets, it is entirely possible that some nonattainment areas subject to the conformity requirements may not have in place an approved SIP containing a MVEB. While the Clean Air Act generally contemplates that conformity determinations will be made by reference to approved SIPs, the Act simply does not address how conformity determinations should be made in the absence of an approved SIP with an adequate motor vehicle emissions budget. See Environmental Def. Fund v. EPA, 167 F.3d 641, 650 (D.C.Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). It therefore cannot be said that the EPA\u2019s holding that the statutory definition of motor vehicle is not controllingrecognizing that use of the then approved shotgun instruction would be improper if it coerced jury into agreement or unduly hastened their considerationrecognizing that language approved by the court may raise questions if incorporated in a jury instruction in a case with different factsholding that the sensible and popular understanding of what a motor vehicle accident entails necessarily involves the motor vehicle being operated as a motor vehicle recognizing that section 7506 does not dictate how conformity should be determined if no approved sip exists or if the approved sip contains no adequate motor vehicle emissions budget & \n\noffense of attempt\u00e9d second-degree murder based on knowing merely that one\u2019s conduct will cause serious physical injury, the giving of the instruction was reversible error. Ontiveros\u2019s conviction must therefore be reversed. CONCLUSION \u00b6 20 We reverse Ontiveros\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial. Because of this disposition, we do not reach the sentencing issue raised by Ontiveros. CONCURRING: G. MURRAY SNOW, Presiding Judge and DONN KESSLER, Judge. 1 . The offense of attempted second-degree murder under \u00a7\u00a7 13-1001(A)(2) and -1104(A)(2) does not, contrary to Ontiveros\u2019s argument, require an intent to cause death. The culpable mental state of knowingly causing the death of another is sufficient under \u00a7 13-1104(A)(2). Cf. State v. Nunez, 159 Ariz. 594, 769 P.2d 1040 (App.1989) (<HOLDING>). The requirement of acting knowingly, however, holding that conspiracy to commit murder is not lesserincluded offense of firstdegree murderholding that fetus was not a human being for purposes of attempted firstdegree intentional homicide and firstdegree reckless injury statutesholding that a jury could not be instructed that attempted murder can be committed knowinglyholding that attempted firstdegree murder may be committed knowingly or intentionallyholding that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to argue based on the first districts decision in montgomery that the standard attempted manslaughterbyact instruction was fundamentally erroneous where betts was charged with attempted firstdegree premeditated murder and convicted of the necessary lesserincluded offense of attempted seconddegree murder & \n\nguilty\u201d was reasonable, and thus, trial court properly instructed jury to continue deliberating). 36 See OCGA \u00a7 17-9-40 (\u201cA verdict may be amended in mere matter of form after the jury have dispersed; but, after it has been received, recorded, and the jury dispersed, it may not be amended in matter of substance, either by what the jurors say they intended to find or otherwise.\u201d); Groves, 162 Ga. at 166 (\u201cThere must be the unanimous assent of the entire twelve jurors before there is a legal verdict. When it develops that such is not the fact, there is no verdict. If the jury has not dispersed, they should be sent to the jury-room, with the direction to consider the case for the purpose of reaching an agreement on a verdict.\u201d); Handley v. McKee, 8 Ga. App. 570, 573 (3) (70 SE 94) (1911) (<HOLDING>); see also Ballard v. Turner, 147 Ga. App. 584, holding that where the meaning of the jurys verdict was not clear in light of the trial courts jury instructions the court of appeals erred in directing entry of judgment for respondent the case should have been remanded to the trial judge who was in the best position to pass upon the question of a new trial in light of the evidence his charge to the jury and the jurys verdictholding that verdict returned by jury should have been received and recorded and that trial court erred by granting a continuance after jury returned its verdict applying the principle announced in merchantsbank of macon 7 ga at 200 4 that a verdict shall be considered as published eo instanti in which it is handed to the plaintiffs counsel or other person directed by the court to receive it emphasis omittedholding that trial court erred in granting plea in bar as to murder when prior to receipt and publication of fact that jury could not reach a verdict on murder count jury had indicated in notes to the trial court that it had acquitted defendant of murder and holding that there was no verdict until it was received and published in open courtholding that after court dismissed case at plaintiffs request notwithstanding the fact that jury had deliberated upon the case and indicated that it had reached a verdict there was no case pending in court on which a verdict could be predicated and the information which the judge got from an inspection of the petition handed to him by the foreman of the jury was information which he received as an individual and not as a judge of the court and further holding that despite violation of defendants right to receive the verdict that was purportedly reached the writing incorporated in the bill of exceptions as a verdict of the jury was in law no verdict because it was not received in court and published as required by law and was instead entirely extraneous and extrajudicialholding that when determining prejudice under the objective test relevant considerations include 1 whether the extrinsic evidence was received by the jury and the manner in which it was received 2 whether it was available to the jury for a lengthy period of time 3 whether it was discussed and considered extensively by the jury 4 whether it was introduced before a jury verdict was reached and if so at what point during the deliberations and 5 whether it was reasonably likely to affect the verdict considering the strength of the governments case and whether the governments case outweighed any possible prejudice caused by the extrinsic evidence & \n\naward, do not justify overturning that award. Instead, only \u201cutterly irrational\u201d legal conclusions will be cognizable; \u201c[i]n these circumstances the appropriate standard of review is whether the construction of the contract presents such an egregious mistake that it amounts to an arbitrary remaking of the contract between the parties.\u201d 277 Cal.Rptr. at 714. Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v. Mid States Port Auth., 242 Kan. 683, 751 P.2d 122, 127 (1988) (<HOLDING>); Runewicz v. Keystone Ins. Co., 476 Pa. 456, holding that an award of arbitration cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or the facts if the award is within the scope of the submission and the arbitrators are not guilty of the acts of misconduct set forth in the statute the award operates as a final and conclusive judgment and however disappointing it may be the parties must abide by itholding that manifest disregard of the law is one of the very unusual circumstances in which a federal court can set aside an arbitration awardholding that errors of law without accompanying fraud or misconduct not enough to set aside arbitration awardholding that the trial court was without authority to set aside entry of default on motion to set aside default judgmentrecognizing that a trial court can set aside verdict & \n\nthe Court deems the \u00a7 523(a)(9) claim to have been tried by the consent of parties, and the Court will therefore consider whether this debt should be excepted from discharge under either \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(6) or (a)(9). Wood also cited \u00a7 523(a)(2) in her complaint, however, Wood has never argued this theory applied under these facts. The Court considers any claim by Wood under this Code section to have been abandoned by Wood. 8 . Assuming a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words, and to give additional context and flavor to this discussion, a photo of the subject truck, admitted in evidence in this action, is appended to this decision. 9 . In contrast, the Fifth Circuit has endorsed the use of an objective test. Miller v. J.D. Abrams Inc. (In re Miller), 156 F.3d 598, 603 (5th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>) 10 . Recall, Jury Instruction No. 16 provides: holding that there must be proof of both a willful act and malicious injury to establish nondischargeability under section 523a6holding that the debtors knowing act of failing to obtain workers compensation insurance so that the employer owed an employee a debt after the employee suffered a workplace injury was not the sort of willful and malicious injury required for nondischargeability under 523a6 because it cannot not be said that the employer intended for the employee to suffer a fall or that there was an unbroken chain of events leading from the employers intentional act to the employees physical injuryholding that either objective substantial certainty or subjective motive meets the supreme courts definition of willful injury in 523a6holding that 523a6 requires the actor to intend the injury not just the act that leads to the injuryholding that a mere deliberate or intentional act that causes injury is not sufficient to establish willfulness in the context of 11 usc 523a6 & \n\nlittle mitigating weight in tijis case. \u00b6 47 Appellant further contends the trial court erred when it failed to regard the giving of a felony murder instruction at trial as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance. We disagree. This court has held that a felony murder instruction \u201cmay be mitigating where there is some doubt as to a defendant\u2019s specific intent to' kill.\u201d State v. Henry, 189 Ariz. 542, 552, 944 P.2d 57, 67 (1997). Appellant\u2019s actions in savagely beating and strangling the victim to death, however, undermine any argument that he did not intend to kill the victim. Moreover, the jurors unanimously found Appellant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder as well as felony murder, indicating that they found\" intent to kill. See Atwood, 171 Ariz. at 648-49, 832 P.2d at 665-66 (<HOLDING>). We therefore conclude that the giving of a holding that when the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of premeditated and felony murder a jury instruction on unanimity is irrelevantholding that reversal of conviction for felony murder was required where jury failed to find the defendant guilty of the underlying felony as essential element of the felony murder offenseholding that where both firstdegree and felony murder were possible bases for a murder conviction a jury instruction that suggested the jury could rely on felony murder as the predicate offense for a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder was improper because under arizona law a conviction for conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder requires a specific intent to killholding that the eighth amendment requires finding that a felony murder defendant killed or attempted to killholding that the giving of a felony murder instruction is not a relevant mitigating circumstance when the defendant acted alone to kill the victim & \n\nfaked left syndrome accident. On appeal, the Estate concedes that the instruction is a correct statement of the law and that it was not covered by other instructions. However, the Estate contends that the instruction was not supported by the evidence in the record because the alleged sudden emergency was the faked left syndrome and the faked left syndrome does not apply to the accident in question. As discussed supra, no evidence was presented to support the applicability of the faked left syndrome, and the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony regarding the faked left syndrome. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by instructing the jury regarding sudden emergency. See, e.g., Collins v. Rambo, 831 N.E.2d 241, 249 (Ind.Ct.App.2005) (<HOLDING>). We address the ramifications of this abuse of holding trial court erred by instructing jury that employer would be liable under burk if plaintiff showed improper motive was a factor in the decision to discharge him rather than a significant factorholding that defendant failed to plead sufficient facts and instructing the trial court to dismiss the plaintiff from the caseholding that sudden emergency is an affirmative defense which must be specifically pleadholding that trial court erred by instructing jury regarding sudden emergencyholding that trial court erred in instructing the jury on unavoidable accident when no evidence supported its submission & \n\nthe prosecutor referred not once but twice to the Supreme Court\u2014 both mentioning \u201cautomatic review\u201d and that the interrogatory to be completed by the jurors also \u201cgoes to the Supreme Court.\u201d We are unwilling to treat lightly the prosecutor\u2019s pointed references to appellate review of this crucial decision. Statements, like those made by the prosecutor here, \u201ccan be literally true but quite misleading by failing, for example, to disclose information essential to make what was said not misleading.\u201d Sawyer, 881 F.2d at 1285. As a result, a Caldwell violation may be established where a technically accurate statement describing the state appellate review process nonetheless \u201cmisled the jury to minimize its role in the sentencing process.\u201d Driscoll v. Delo, 71 F.3d 701, 713 (8th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Given the limited nature of the Delaware holding that under the alabama death penalty statute because the judge did not consider the jurys recommendation the statute which forced the jury to sentence the defendant to death whenever aggravating circumstances existed was not unconstitutionalholding that the fact that a judge had ruled against the defendant is not a basis for finding the judge prejudicedholding that a defendant was not entitled to a relief under section 2255 when he asserted that the sentencing judge who was not the trial judge was influenced by the sentence imposed by the trial judge on a codefendantholding that private individuals who conspired with judge could be sued even though judge could notholding that prosecutor had violated caldwell by emphasizing that the trial judge could disregard the jurys recommendation of death even though no state judge had in fact ever done so & \n\n72 S.Ct. 93, 95, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951) (\"Over and again this Court has emphasized that the mandate of the [Fourth] Amendment requires adherence to judicial processes. Only where incident to a valid arrest, or in 'exceptional circumstances,\u2019 may an exemption lie, and then the burden is on those seeking the exemption to show the need for it.\" (citations omitted)). 3 .

Appellant Kenneth Dana Brewton, by and through his counsel David L. Dunagin, moves this court for leave to file a belated brief. Brewton\u2019s brief was due in this court on October 14, 2008. After no brief was filed, the State filed a motion to dismiss on December 8, 2008. Thereafter, Brewton tendered his brief and filed the instant motion requesting to file the belated brief. We will accept a criminal appellant\u2019s belated brief to prevent an appeal from being aborted. See Brown v. State, 373 Ark. 453, 284 S.W.3d 481 (2008) (per cu-riam). However, good cause must be shown to grant the motion. See Strom v. State, 356 Ark. 224, 147 S.W.3d 689 (2004) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Here, Brewton accepts full responsibility and holding that failure to brief an argument constitutes waiverholding an appellate brief may serve as a notice of appealholding issues not raised in appellate brief are waivedholding failure to brief argument constitutes waiverholding that appellate counsels admitted failure to timely file the brief constituted good cause to grant motion for belated brief & \n\n859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir.1988). When considering a motion to dismiss, a court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept well-pleaded facts as true. Columbia Natural Resources Inc. v. Tatum, 58 F.3d 1101, 1109 (6th Cir.1995). Thus, a court may not grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based upon its disbelief of a complaint\u2019s factual allegations. Id. A court, however, need not accept as true conclusions of law or unwarranted factual inferences. Morgan v. Church\u2019s Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides that, \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud ..., the circumstances constituting fraud ... shall. be stated with particularity.\u201d See generally Begala v.

For that reason, appellant\u2019s fourth issue cannot be sustained. Therefore, we overrule appellant's fourth issue. 4 . Bell and Baptist assert relevant questions which a jury would have to consider and would necessitate an expert's opinion: for example, (1) whether the decision to use an arterial line was within the appropriate standard of care; (2)what are the appropriate procedures for an arterial line insertion; (3) what other possible medical causes could exist; (4) what should have been the appropriate medical treatment or intervention?

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

Or, once the mortgage is avoided and preserved for the benefit of the estate, the Trustee might himself seek its reformation in state court. But what the Trustee cannot do in a Chapter 7 case is use the Bankruptcy Code to change the terms of an avoidable mortgage. Reformation of the 2007 Mortgage is reserved to the parties to that mortgage and\/or the state court. For these reasons, approval of the Compromise in the form offered is not possible. Nor can the Court fashion its own remedy for liquidating the estate\u2019s interest in the 2007 Mortgage in lieu of the Trustee\u2019s judgment. See In re Central Illinois Energy, L.L.C., 406 B.R. 371 (Bankr.C.D.Ill. 2008) (<HOLDING>). C. Debtor\u2019s Motion to Abandon Section 554(b) holding that because the alleged settlement was never approved by the court under rule 9019 the settlement agreement was unenforceableholding that a settlement agreement is not a court order and therefore a violation of the settlement agreement would not subject a party to contemptholding that the plaintiffs lawsuit which was filed despite a general release in the parties settlement agreement constituted a material breach of the settlement agreementholding that a settlement agreement in which the parties failed to agree upon the terms of a release was unenforceableholding that a bankruptcy court cannot rewrite an agreement and by doing so approve terms that differ from those to which the parties agreed in evaluating a proposed settlement or compromise under rule 9019 the court must accept or reject the agreement as presented & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\n344, 354 (1910) (noting that it is the prerogative of the civil courts to determine the meaning and legal effect of civil contracts). An aggrieved party, including a criminal defendant, remains free to seek enforcement of the terms of a release in civil court. Our criminal courts are permitted to take note of these agreements in deciding whether to order restitution and in what amount, but these agreements in no way preclude a criminal court from ordering restitution when appropriate under statute. Id. In essence, the Haltom court upheld a restitution order in the amount of the victim\u2019s medical expenses and lost earnings even though the victim had also received $100,000 \u2014 the limit of Haltom\u2019s policy\u2014 from Haltom\u2019s insurer. See also Crawford v. State, 770 N.E.2d 775, 781 (Ind.2002) (<HOLDING>). We are mindful, however, that elementary holding that restitution is a criminal penalty that negates the imposition of prejudgment interestholding civil restitution judgment that was originally imposed as part of a criminal sentence nondisehargeableholding that imposition of punishment is a judicial functionrecognizing criminal forfeiture as an aspect of punishmentholding that civil settlements have no bearing on decisions of criminal punishment and imposition of a restitution order is a form of punishment and part of a criminal sentence & \n\n(7)(f) or other discovery under N.D.R.Crim.P. 16, but the defendant is not under obligation to do so. The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v. Anderson, 303 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1981) (<HOLDING>). The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\nto as a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d in which we look to the record of conviction, including the indictment, plea, verdict, and sentence (or any other documents admissible under the federal regulations to prove a criminal conviction, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.41 (1995)) to determine whether the actual offense of which the alien was convicted qualifies as a crime of violence. See Ye v. INS, 214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000); Solorzano-Patlan v. INS, 207 F.3d 869, 875 (7th Cir.2000); Wadman v. INS, 329 F.2d 812, 814 (9th Cir.1964); see also Pichardo-Sufren, 21 I. & N. Dec. 330, 334 (BIA 1996)(en banc). The courts have emphasized that it is not what the alien did, but the crime of which he was convicted, determined by the record of conviction, that is dispositive. Ye v. INS, 214 F.3d at 1133 (<HOLDING>); In re Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I. & N. Dec. 323, holding that once the statute is found to be divisible the court must look to the charging papers and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual crime of which defendant was convicted was a crime of violence but emphasizing that the court is not to examine the particular facts underlying the convictionholding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16holding that a district court may not rely on a charging document without first establishing that the crime charged was the same crime for which the defendant was convictedrecognizing that a court may look to the charging document in making a crime of violence determination but only where the statute provides disjunctive methods of committing the offense and the court needs to determine which of the statutory alternatives is involved in the particular caseholding that courts should look to the statutory definition of the crime charged rather than the actual facts of the individuals prior conviction to determine whether the crime qualifies as a violent felony under the acca & \n\nand acceptance of responsibility as mitigating factors. See Sensback, 720 N.E.2d at 1164-1165. 2. Lack of Criminal History Page argues that the trial court gave no weight to his lack of criminal history. We disagree. The trial court recognized Page\u2019s lack of criminal history as a miti-gator but discounted the value of this miti-gator. Specifically, the trial court stated, \u201cThe court finds as mitigating circumstances that he has some criminal history, arguably it\u2019s not significant, but a weapons charge and another pending crime of violence along with these three crimes of violence, I don\u2019t think the mitigators are worth much.\u201d Transcript at 34. Page asks us to review the weight given to this mitigating factor for abuse of discretion, which we cannot do. See Anglemyer, 868 N.E.2d at 491 (<HOLDING>). B. Aggravators Page appears to argue that the holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave aggravating factors considerable weightholding that the relative weight or value assignable to aggravating and mitigating factors properly found is not subject to review for abuse of discretionholding that a trial courts weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors will not be disturbed absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretionholding that trial court retains wide discretion to apply or reject mitigating and aggravating factors as well as to interpret meaning of individual factors and its determination must be upheld absent abuse of discretionholding imposition of the death penalty proportionate where the trial court found two aggravating circumstances ccp and contemporaneous murder two statutory mitigating factors and a number of nonstatutory mitigating factors & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N.

Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\ndecision to waive his right to counsel. 3 . Our concurring colleague, Judge Katzmann, disagrees with our characterization of the quoted language as dictum. In his view, the Supreme Court would not have vacated the state judgment of conviction if it had not been satisfied that Faretta knowingly exercised his right to self-representation; thus, the Court\u2019s discussion of what constitutes a \"knowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of the right to counsel \u201cwas essential to its conclusion that Faretta\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\u201d Infra at 566. We are not convinced. Given Faretta's recognition of a constitutional right to represent oneself, the Court might well have vacated the state conviction and remanded the case even without a finding of a valid waiver of the right t 1984) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Medina, 944 F.2d holding that for a trial judge to accept a defendants guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary violates the defendants constitutional rightsholding that right to challenge factual basis is waived by guilty pleaholding that factual basis inquiry is one way of satisfying the constitutional requirement that a guilty plea be voluntary and intelligent but it is not mandated by due processholding that a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal chargeholding that due process requires state courts to make an affirmative showing that a guilty plea is intelligent and voluntary & \n\nordinarily defer to the legislature\u2019s stated intent, only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.\u201d Id. at 92, 123 S.Ct. 1140 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). The New Mexico Constitution also prohibits the state legislature from enacting ex post facto laws or bills of attainder, see N.M. Const., Art. 2 \u00a7 19, and analyzes ex post facto claims under the same framework, see State v. Druktenis, 135 N.M. 223, 233, 86 P.3d 1050 (N.M.Ct. App.2004). In Smith, the Supreme Court considered the ex post facto implications of an Alaskan sex registration statute that is similar in many ways to NMSORNA. See id. at 235, 86 P.3d 1050 (citing Smith, 538 U.S. at 103-04, 123 S.Ct. 1140) (<HOLDING>). Alaska\u2019s law was designed to apply recognizing the applicability of the mcdonough standard to federal criminal proceedingsrecognizing the presumptions applicability to federal statutesrecognizing the applicability of rule 9b under such circumstancesrecognizing the applicability of the smith analysis to nmsornarecognizing applicability of discovery rule & \n\noriginal intended purpose requirement. Indeed, two of the words, \u201crepair\u201d and \u201crefurbish,\u201d lend themselves most naturally to an interpretation that an item will retain its originally intended purpose. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1923 (2002) (defining \u201crepair\u201d as \u201cto restore by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken\u201d (emphasis added)); id. at 1910 (defining \u201crefurbish\u201d as \u201cto make as if new\u201d); see also In re Mallo, 774 F.3d 1313, 1321 (10th Cir.2014) (recognizing that we interpret words using their ordinary and common meanings). And there is nothing about any of the other three words, \u201cresold,\u201d \u201cdonated,\u201d and \u201creused,\u201d that excludes an original intended purpose requirement. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s at 672 (defining \u201cdonate\u201d as \u201cto make 05) (<HOLDING>). But see Tebbetts v. Whitson, 956 P.2d 639, holding that a superior court can adjudicate a child as a child in need of aid based on the acts of just one parentholding a fetus is not a child person or individual for purposes of criminal prosecution under the reckless injury to a child statuteholding that an outofwedlock childs pending claim for retroactive child support was nondischargeable in bankruptcy because a debt for child support arises upon the birth of the child and that the fact that no court had yet ordered the debtor to support the child does not take the debt outside the scope of 11 usc 523a5holding that statute defining prostitution of a child as inducing a child to perform sex acts through the use of coercion threat or intimidation or in exchange for money can reasonably be construed in two different ways one which does not require a commercial transaction and one that does and turning to the legislative history for guidanceholding an unborn child is not a child for purposes of criminal prosecution of mistreatment of a child & \n\nfactor seven, the relative bargaining power of the parties, weighs against a finding that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily made the waiver. An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin. Servs. Co., 191 F.Supp.2d at 814 (<HOLDING>). Consequently, Bank of America failed to meet holding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntaryrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding under similar facts as a matter of law that a knowing and voluntary waiver of powells right to a jury trial has not been demonstratedholding waiver of right to counsel not voluntary and knowing when defendant terminated counsel and requested another attorney but the trial court would allow delay and appointment only upon waiver of speedy trial right & \n\nadvice and an immigration judge ordered him removed to Jamaica, where he has resided ever since\u2014separated from much of his family, including his parents and his daughter, and from the country he had called home for most of his life. Then, in 2010, the Supreme Court offered Newman a ray of hope. In Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010), it held that defense attorneys provide inadequate representation when they fail to advise their clients about the likely deportation consequences of pleading guilty. Armed with that decision, Newman filed a petition for a writ of coram nobis, which provides a means of collaterally attacking a conviction when the person is no longer in custody. See United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954) (<HOLDING>). Newman argued that a writ was appropriate recognizing that under the common law applications for writs of error coram nobis were civil in characterholding that district court had jurisdiction to consider claims under the all writs actrecognizing the all writs act gives federal courts authority to issue writs of coram nobis to correct fundamental errors in criminal proceedings where the person is no longer in custodyholding that this court has authority in appropriate circumstances to issue writs under all writs act 28 usc 1651aholding that removal to federal court was proper for claims asserted under all writs act & \n\ncrime of violence under the elements clause. As a result, there is no need to reach the constitutionality of Section 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s residual clause. See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]f a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter.\u201d). The determination of whether a predicate offense is a crime of violence under the elements clause is not made on the facts of the specific allegations against a defendant, but is instead made categorically based on the elements of the offense. See Aguilar v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the United States, 663 F.3d 692, 695 (3d Cir. 2011) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Butler, 496 Fed.Appx. 158, holding that sexual assault of a child qualified as crime of violence under 18 usc 16holding that the categorical approach applies to the identical definition of crime of violence in 18 usc 16holding that the categorical approach applies to 924cholding dui causing serious bodily injury is not a crime of violence under 18 usc 16holding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16 & \n\nchallenge a vehicle search from passenger standing to seek suppression of evidence discovered in a vehicle as the fruit of an unlawful stop, detention, or arrest.\u201d). Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Because there is no evidence in this case holding that plain error review is appropriate unless there is some evidence that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of a particular argumentholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nfactors, the Burnet court relied on Snedigar, which had in turn relied on Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. 223. The Snedigar court\u2019s holding (with the Burnet court\u2019s deletions italicized) is as follows: We . . . hold that when a trial judge chooses one of the harsher remedies allowable under CR 37(b), the reasons for that choice should he clearly stated on the record. We further hold that when the most severe sanction of default or dismissal is ordered, it must be apparent from the record that the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed, and whether it found the Associated Mortgage due process factors [of willfulness and substantial prejudice] to be present. 53 Wn. App. at 487 (emphasis added); Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. at 228-29 (<HOLDING>). The Burnet court also cited a line of cases holding that a trial court had the authority to impose a default judgment as a sanction for violating a rule 16 scheduling order pursuant to rule 37b2 stating we agree with the basic premise that a default sanction can under certain circumstances be an appropriate response to a violation of a rule 16 order after all the express terms of rule 37 permit a trial court to impose sanctions when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discoveryholding that district courts order granting motion for default judgment was erroneous because a default judgment cannot be entered until the amount of damages has been ascertained holding that a postjudgment contempt sanction for refusal to obey orders whether it is characterized as a civil or a criminal sanction is immediately appealable as a final order under 1291recognizing that courts have discretion to exclude evidence as a sanction for violation of a discovery orderholding that the sanction of a default judgment authorized by cr 37b2c is a harsh remedy which should only be granted where there has been a willful or deliberate refusal to obey a discovery order which refusal substantially prejudices the opponents ability to prepare for trial & \n\n"}

While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla.

The commentary in Collier on Bankruptcy suggests that the addition of \"actual fraud\u201d simply clarifies the limited scope of the fraud exception: The addition of the words \u201cor actual fraud\u201d probably makes no change in the law as it existed prior to enactment of the [Bankruptcy Act of 1978] because false pretenses and representations were construed to mean acts involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong....

These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit.

In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree.

It is irrelevant what else Platt might have learned through further diligent investigation after 1999 about UL\u2019s misrepresentations or intent to deceive Platt and others regarding the Cadet heaters\u2019 safety, because in 1999 Platt already knew that UL\u2019s prior representations about the heaters\u2019 safety were false, and that knowledge was sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations for fraud under California law.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>).

Because materiality is a mixed question of fact and law for the jury, Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 512-15, 115 S.Ct. 2310, a court may only decide the issue, as a matter of law, when no reasonable juror could find materiality on the evidence presented, cf.

Pross, 303 S.E.2d at 890. The United States Supreme Court has also employed a similar rule of statutory construction when interpreting whether the United States is included as a \u201cperson\u201d within federal legislation: Since, in common usage, the term \u201cperson\u201d does not include the sovereign, statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it. But there is no hard and fast rule of exclusion. The purpose, the subject matter, the context, the legislative history, and the executive interpretation of the statute are aids to construction which may indicate an intent, by the use of the term, to bring state or nation within the scope of the law. United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604-05, 61 S.Ct. 742, 743-44, 85 L.Ed. 1071 (1941) (<HOLDING>). Employing the above standards, we are holding that a plaintiff may state a claim under the sherman act for a defendants enforcement of a patent procured by fraud on the pto where the plaintiff alleges deliberate fraud and the other elements of a monopolization claim under section 2 of the sherman actholding that the government is liable under the ftca in the same respect as a private person under the law of the place where the act occurredholding that plaintiffs complaint failed to state a claim under section 1 of the sherman actholding that the use of the words any person was insufficient under the ordinary dignities of speech to authorize an action by the federal government for treble damages under the sherman actholding treble damages under the civil theft statute are punitive & \n\nso accommodating. See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a) (\u201c... the trustee, with the court\u2019s approval, may employ ...\u201d); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b) (\u201cThe trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease ... \u201d); and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a) (\u201c... the trustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume or reject ... \u201d). As a consequence, courts have been left in these many instances to figure out for themselves what they are to consider. Their response, though, has frequently been limited to only the adoption of some vague standard that in turn is exemplified by some equally vague phrase. Take, for example, the different measures that courts have offered in connection with Section 363(b) sales. Section 363(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code governs the present dispute and provides (Bankr.D.Del.1987) (<HOLDING>); In re Charlesbank Laundry Co., 37 B.R. 20, 22 holding that the duty of good faith and fair dealing is a contractual dutyholding that duty of good faith and fair dealing did not extend to thirdparty claimantholding that benefiting fiduciary must show he acted in good faith and that transactions were fair and equitableholding that a sale must be both fair and reasonable in price and made in good faithholding that the transaction must be fair and equitable and in good faith & \n\nstandard to be applied, therefore, it would provide an additional basis for concluding that the Government Defendants are not arrangers under \u00a7 9607(a)(3). 278 . Carson Harbor objects that the Partnership Defendants' motion is based on new arguments that were not raised in their initial motion for summary judgment in 1997. It asserts the court should refuse to consider these arguments because they should have been raised in the initial motion. The Partnership Defendants\u2019 position has changed materially because of the prior proceedings in this case. All but one of the claims against these defendants has now been dismissed. Accordingly, the court finds that it is appropriate to consider any new arguments raised in the motion. See F.D.I.C. v. Kooyomjian, 220 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). 279 .

Accordingly, we deny the petition for review and uphold the Board\u2019s decision. A. Adverse Credibility Determination The Immigration Judge denied Petitioner refugee status primarily because she found that he was not credible. After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that substantial evidence supports this adverse credibility determination.

Sixth, the IJ commented that it was \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that Suntharalinkam had testified during the hearing that he was hospitalized for some ten days following his release from detention, whereas his asylum application did not mention hospitalization and instead only referred to medical treatment that he received at that time. The IJ\u2019s concern is unfounded, as in fact there is no \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between the application and Suntharalinkam\u2019s testimony that can legally form the basis of an adverse credibility decision. An adverse credibility finding cannot be based on petitioner providing testimony that is more detailed than the information presented in the asylum application. See Singh v. INS, 292 F.3d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). Here, there is no contradiction between the holding that a failure to corroborate ones testimony with supporting evidence cannot form the sole basis for an adverse credibility determinationholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding that an adverse credibility finding can be based on materially different asylum claims in an airport interview and petitioners subsequent testimony before the ijholding that an adverse credibility determination cannot be based on trial testimony that is more detailed than the applicants initial statements at the airportholding that in the absence of an adverse credibility determination the court must accept petitioners testimony as true & \n\n125 (2d Cir.2006), no reasonable fact-finder would have been compelled to credit the explanation he offered, see Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). These inconsistencies went to the heart of Petitioner\u2019s claim as they related to the medical care he received for his alleged beatings. See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir.2008). Since the only evidence that Petitioner was likely to be persecuted or tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination precludes success on his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005); cf. Ramsameachire v.

We decline to consider Petitioner\u2019s challenge holding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that defeat of asylum claim on credibility grounds does not necessarily preclude relief on a cat claimholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding it improper to deny cat relief based on adverse credibility finding where objective documentary evidence establishes likelihood of tortureholding that a negative credibility finding for the purposes of an asylum claim does not preclude relief under cat where documented country conditions corroborate a claim of torture & \n\n\u201d id. at 1281 (quoting Compact art.

Two caveats must accompany the League court\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute\u2019s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 351-52, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989) (<HOLDING>). Under the Compact, an EIS needs to include holding that an eis must consider the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided by discussing possible mitigation measuresrecognizing that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense a party must plead and proveholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleadedholding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by a true inconsistencyholding that perfunctory description of mitigation measures was inadequate & \n\nv. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148 (2d Cir.2006), to challenge the BIA\u2019s consideration of the underlying adverse credibility determination is misplaced. In Paul, we held that the BIA abused its discretion by denying a motion to reopen based on changed country circumstances, where, despite an adverse credibility finding, the IJ had explicitly credited the movant\u2019s assertion regarding his religious affiliation that would likely result in persecution. Id. at 152-55. Here, unlike in Paul, the IJ did not find any aspect of petitioner\u2019s testimony credible, and the BIA reasonably relied on this general adverse credibility finding (along with other evidence) to find that petitioner did not adequately establish her religious affiliation. See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 143, 146-49 (2d Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Because petitioner\u2019s assertion of ineffective holding that speculation and conjecture cannot support an adverse credibility findingholding that inconsistencies in the aliens statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility findingrecognizing that omissions of details may be an insufficient basis for upholding an adverse credibility findingholding a general adverse credibility finding may justify a decision to reject other claimsholding that history of dishonesty can support an adverse credibility finding & \n\nevidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B).

This jurisdiction stripping provision remains holding that ij properly based adverse credibility finding on omission in asylum application where omitted fact went to the heart of the asylum claim citation omittedholding that because the ij denied an asylum application as untimely we lacked subjectmatter jurisdiction to review the final order of removal as it pertained to the asylum claimholding that a properly filed motion to reopen is a prerequisite to the filing of a new asylum application when the petitioner is under a final removal orderholding that it was within the discretion of the bia to deny a motion to reopen because it was not accompanied by an asylum applicationholding that when an ij issues a decision granting an aliens application for withholding of removal without a grant of asylum the decision must include an explicit order of removal designating a country of removal & \n\nadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d); Yanqin Weng v.

Although we generally afford particular deference to an IJ\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor, Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005), we have never held that a demeanor finding alone is substantial evidence sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination, see Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 453 F.3d 99, 109 (2d Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>); see also Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, 357 F.3d holding that this court can be more confident in its review of observations about an applicants demeanor where they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimonyholding that the agency may rely on a lack of corroborative evidence where an applicants testimony is not otherwise credibleholding that an ij may not use general information contained in a state department report to discredit specific testimony regarding an applicants personal experienceholding that conviction can be supported solely by circumstantial evidenceholding that an adverse credibility determination cannot be based on trial testimony that is more detailed than the applicants initial statements at the airport & \n\nInstead, the BIA found him ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT on the merits. Because the BIA did not order Fajardo-Alvarez removed based upon his offense and made a determination on the merits, we have jurisdiction to review the decision. See Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 931, 936-37 (9th Cir.2005). However, we lack jurisdiction to consider this petition on the merits. Fajardo-Alvarez failed to exhaust the critical issue of credibility in his appeal to the BIA, notwithstanding the IJ\u2019s clear and unambiguous findings regarding adverse credibility. See Barron v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore have no basis to consider Fajardo-Alvarez\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT. See Zara v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 927, 931 (9th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). PETITION DENIED. ** This disposition is not holding where withholding of removal and cat claims were based on the same discredited testimony the bia properly concluded the adverse credibility finding was fatal to all claimsholding that when the asylum withholding of removal and cat claims are based on the same factual predicate a credibility ruling necessarily forecloses relief in eachholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that petitioners failure to exhaust the adverse credibility finding precluded this court from having jurisdiction to consider her claims of asylum withholding of removal and catholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibility & \n\nHor v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 497, 501-02 (7th Cir.2005). An applicant seeking withholding of removal \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating that loss of life or freedom is more likely than not\u201d if she returned to her home country, Kobugabe, 440 F.3d at 901, but an applicant\u2019s credible testimony can sustain this burden of proof without corroboration, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). On the other hand, an IJ may find an applicant\u2019s testimony incredible if she \u201cfails to present certain foundational evidence.\u201d Balogun v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 492, 502 (7th Cir.2004). While these two concepts can become easily conflated, they are distinct. Essentially, an IJ may disbelieve an applicant because she fails to provide corroborating evidence, and subsequently deny her claim. See id.; Zaid 630 (7th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Though the IJ may have implicitly found that holding that where the ij finds the petitioner to be credible his testimony must be acceptedholding an ij must to address a petitioners explanation for inconsistencies to rely upon them as the basis for an adverse credibility findingholding that an ij failed to make explicit credibility finding when he made passing remark that he disbelieved applicants testimonyholding substantial evidence supported the denial of cat relief where the petitioners cat claim was based on the same testimony the ij found not credible and the petitioner pointed to no other evidence that the ij should have consideredholding that an ij made an explicit credibility when the ij found testimony not credible based on several enumerated inconsistencies & \n\nin the best position to discern the impression conveyed by the witness, and because the IJ\u2019s finding of non-responsiveness was supported by the record, the IJ reasonably found that Li\u2019s demeanor undermined her credibility. See Zhou Yun Zhang, 386 F.3d at 73. Similarly, the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Li was \u201chesitant and vague\u201d when asked to describe her mother\u2019s practice of Falun Gong. The record reflects that Li\u2019s testimony on this topic was \u201cspare\u201d and that the IJ attempted to \u201cprobe for incidental details.\u201d Jin Shui Qiu v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 140, 152 (2d Cir.2003). Because the IJ\u2019s finding also included her perception of Li\u2019s demeanor, it serves as an adequate basis for an adverse credibility finding. See Jin Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 426 F.3d 104, 114 (2d Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Additionally, the IJ reasonably found that it holding that history of dishonesty can support an adverse credibility findingholding that in the absence of an adverse credibility determination the court must accept petitioners testimony as trueholding that the record did not support the agencys adverse credibility finding in the absence of additional probingholding that speculation and conjecture cannot support an adverse credibility findingholding that inconsistencies adequately support the administrative law judges alj adverse credibility finding & \n\nis not wholly and immediately foreclosed; rather, the Court's inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded''). GINSBURG, Circuit Judge, concurring: We have held that actions based upon denial of security clearance do not merely fail to state a claim, but are beyond the reach of judicial review. See Bennett, 425 F.3d at 1001 (\u201cBecause the authority to issue a security clearance is a discretionary function of the Executive Branch and involves the complex area of foreign relations and national security, employment actions based on denial of security clearance are not subject to judicial review\u201d); Ryan, 168 F.3d at 524 (<HOLDING>); Krc, 905 F.2d at 395. That a plaintiff makes holding that denial of the opportunity to work overtime is an adverse employment action sufficient to make out a prima facie case under title viiholding an adverse employment action based on denial or revocation of a security clearance is not actionable under title viiholding that denial of a bonus was not an adverse employment actionholding that a verbal threat of being fired is not an adverse employment action for purposes of title viiholding that termination is an adverse employment action & \n\nevidence and must uphold the decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. Tekle v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008). We affirm. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility finding. Singh testified that he drove a taxi from 1998 to 2000 as his full-time job and was arrested a third time after driving militants in his taxi. In his application for redetermination of custody status, however, he stated that he was a farm worker during this period. When questioned about the inconsistency, Singh was evasive and nonresponsive. Because Singh provided inconsistent statements regarding the circumstances of his third arrest, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported. See Kohli v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1061, 1071 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Because Singh failed to establish eligibility holding that inconsistencies in the aliens statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility findingholding that minor discrepancies that do not involve the heart of the asylum claim are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility findingholding that ijs adverse credibility was not supported by substantial evidence where there were significant communication and translation problems during the asylum hearing and the discrepancies at issue were not crucial to petitioners claimholding that minor discrepancies in the date of an aliens graduation from high school as compared to the date of a beating did not justify an adverse credibility findingholding adverse credibility finding was supported based on discrepancies between aliens testimony and statements regarding a police detention & \n\nasylum application, but we find it doubtful that the DHS would deny asylum to the victim of a politically motivated, two-week detention filled with deliberate, vicious beatings but grant it to a similar applicant with additional nonlethal electrical shocks; pain is pain, whether inflicted with or without technological sophistication. Giday, 434 F.3d at 552. The discrepancies regarding Captain Azote\u2019s assassination, with the exception of those dealing with the motivation for the killing, are similarly unimportant. If Azote was killed for his association with Adekpe, it suggests that the government would likely kill Adekpe too, if given the chance, regardless of whether Azote was killed on a Monday or Saturday, walking or jogging. Kllokoqi v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 336, 341-42 (7th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Finally, the IJ found it unreasonable that holding that the date of the federal indictment not the date of the state arrest was the triggering date for the speedytrial actholding that minor discrepancies that do not involve the heart of the asylum claim are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility findingholding that minor discrepancies in the date of an aliens graduation from high school as compared to the date of a beating did not justify an adverse credibility findingholding adverse credibility finding was supported based on discrepancies between aliens testimony and statements regarding a police detentionholding that inconsistencies in the aliens statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility finding & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N. LaSalle, 190 B.R. at 585 (noting \u201cthe lack of any clear standard for determining the fairness of a discrimination in the treatment of classes under a chapter 11 plan\u201d and that \u201cthe limits of fairness in this context have not been established\u201d). Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\nexplanation that any such discrepancy was a result of miscommunication with his lawyer. See Majid,i v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Hariyanto argues that he corrected the error regarding his religion with the asylum officer during his asylum interview, but he failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA and the Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief; we therefore decline to consider this issue. See Lin Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007) (describing the issue exhaustion requirement as an \u201caffirmative defense subject to waiver\u201d). The adverse credibility finding was also based on Hariyanto\u2019s failure to submit sufficient evidence corroborating his claim. See Biao Yang v.

We also think the IJ was within the bounds of reasonable adjudication in discounting Kaur\u2019s testimony that she was raped at the police station. The police conduct was heinous if the testimony is believed, and it is understandable that the female petitioner may have been reluctant to discuss such a degrading experience if it occurred. In light of the overall credibility problems with the testimony of Singh and Kaur, however, we cannot say that the IJ was compelled to accept Kaur\u2019s statements about the incident at the police station without some corroboration. See Esaka v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 1105, 1110 (8th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>).

We agree that there is substantial evidence in the record for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination against Zou and for the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Zou asylum. We have carefully considered all of Zou\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Those arguments and supporting materials raised for the first time in this court without being properly presented to the IJ or the BIA cannot be considered; our jurisdiction is limited to the evidence in the record.

Because Congress has explicitly provided for suits against the IRS for refunds only if the claimant files a complaint within two years of the agency\u2019s decision to deny a refund claim, courts do not have jurisdiction to entertain challenges brought later.

While the Court understands that, for purposes of res judi-cata, each patent is distinct, there is undoubtedly no question here as to whether the '505 and '418 patents are independent of the four patents involved in the 2006 Maryland action. Thus, the issue here is not one of res judicata; rather, it is whether StemCells subjected itself to the jurisdiction of this Court when it filed a prior suit against Neuralstem with respect to related patents, involving the same parties, and arising out of the same transaction or same nucleus of operative facts. See Gen. Contracting & Trading Co. v. Interpole, Inc., 940.F.2d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>).

The phrase \u201ctransacting any business\u201d (R.C. 2307.382[A][2]) has been interpreted very broadly by Ohio courts. Schneider v. Gunnerman (Aug. 24, 1998), Fayette App. Nos.

Our conclusion that the D\u2019Oench doctrine has not been preempted by statute is reinforced by an examination of Motorcity\u2019s argument that \u00a7\u00a7 1821(d)(9)(A) and 1823(e)(1) are inapplicable because Motorcity repaid its loan to Southeast before the FDIC was appointed receiver.

Because it repaid its note, Motorcity argues that there is no longer any specific asset to which the alleged oral agreements relate. See Murphy v.

A suit seeking a writ of habeas corpus, although admittedly somewhat of a hybrid, is considered civil in nature. See Santana v. United States, 98 F.3d 752, 754 (3d Cir.1996). Accordingly, by operation of \u00a7 76(a), as of October 1, 1991 the District Court of the Virgin Islands was divested of jurisdiction to consider petitions for writs of habeas corpus under territorial habeas corpus law.

Co., 416 F.3d 214, 223 (3d Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the case returned to holding that the one year limit applies only to removals based on something other than the initial pleading that is only to removals pursuant to the second paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding that a writ of summons alone can no longer be the initial pleading that triggers the 30day period for removal under the first paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding other paper must be unequivocally clear and certain to start the time limit running for a notice of removal under the second paragraph of section 1446bholding that removal under the second paragraph of 1446b did not apply and defendants therefore had removed outside of the thirty day time period triggered at the time of service of the complaintholding that an initial pleading triggered the thirtyday time limit for removal under 1446b because it sets forth on its face express allegations as to the monetary amount of damages & \n\nbecause the notice of appeal mentioned both the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Plaintiffs action and the district court\u2019s decision denying Plaintiffs Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for relief from that decision, we have jurisdiction to review both of those decisions. See Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). See generally Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (construing pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings liberally). In his appellate brief, however, Plaintiff also challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny his later-filed Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration. Because Plaintiff never filed a separate notice of appeal from that denial, we have no jurisdiction to consider it. See Bowles v. Russell, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (<HOLDING>); see also Stouffer v. Reynolds, 168 F.3d 1155, holding that the 30day notice of appeal requirement is mandatory and jurisdictionalholding timely notice of appeal under fed rapp p 4a is jurisdictionalholding time for filing notice of appeal under rule 8002 is jurisdictionalholding that timeliness of filing of notice of appeal is a jurisdictional issueholding that the appeal was timely filed because federal rule of appellate procedure 4a provides inmates with sixty days to appeal the denial of a 2255 motion & \n\nargues that because the suicide exclusion in the supplemental policy lacks the specific phrase \u201cwhether sane or insane\u201d it is not a valid defense to coverage. PL\u2019s Mem in Supp. at 19. ERISA has no bearing on this question of validity as suicide exclusions fall under the so-called \u201cinsurance exception\u201d to ERISA preemption and accordingly are governed by state law. See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Mass., 471 U.S. 724, 742 n.18, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985) (\u201cNearly every court that has addressed the question has concluded that laws regulating the substantive content of insurance contracts are laws that regulate insurance and thus are within the scope of the insurance savings clause.\u201d); Hoeflicker v. Cent. States. Se. & Sw. Areas Health Welfare Fund, 644 F.Supp. 195, 199 (W.D.Mo.1986) (<HOLDING>). Because no Virginia case has directly holding that a law which regulates what terms insurance companies can place in their policies regulates insurance companiesholding that a suicide exclusion regulates insurance and therefore falls within the insurance savings clauseholding that plaintiff could recover medical fees not actually paid by the insurance company pursuant to an insurance contractholding that notice and a hearing were required before the commissioner of insurance could require an insurance company to change its definition of at fault in order to secure approval of an increase in insurance ratesholding that a policy with an excess other insurance clause provides no coverage until a policy with a pro rata other insurance clause is exhausted & \n\nas to the reliability of the general theory and techniques of DNA profiling are valid under the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Daubert, and hold that in the future courts can take judicial notice of their reliability. If new techniques are offered, however, the district court must hold an in limine hearing under the Daubert standard as set out above. The fact that we have taken judicial notice of the reliability of the technique of DNA profiling does not mean that expert testimony concerning DNA profiling is automatically admissible under Daubert. A number of courts have required that the trial court further inquire into whether the expert properly performed the techniques involved in creating the DNA profiles. See People v. Castro, 144 Misc.2d 956, 545 N.Y.S.2d 545 (Sup.Ct.1989) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Two Bulls, 918 F.2d 56, 61 holding that the admissibility of expert testimony was governed by state lawholding that admissibility conditioned on a finding that the expert properly performed the protocols underlying dna profilingholding that the burden of laying the proper foundation for the admission of the expert testimony is on the party offering the expert and admissibility must be shown by a preponderance of the evidenceholding that there was no ineffective assistance for failing to hire a dna expert because the defenses theory was that the defendants dna was planted so the dna evidence would not seem to be an issuerecognizing that in prior decisions the court had used the term inconclusive to mean that dna evidence did not exclude an individual but clarifying that in the future the term inconclusive would be used only when a dna sample does not contain enough dna to draw a conclusion dna is degraded or for other reasons a dna test yields no results or the examiner draws no conclusion & \n\nDistrict Court Approval). No mention is made of conditional discharge or deferred sentencing in these forms, and no form indicates the possibility of being found not guilty or of having the charges dismissed for any one of the myriad other reasons that can result in dismissal. {12} Nonetheless, because of the ubiquitousness of the language that a defendant must be informed of the permissible range of sentences, see Boykin v. Ala., 395 U.S. 238, 245 n. 1, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), Petitioner claims that his plea was involuntary because the officer did not advise him that he could appear in court and request a deferral of the prosecution or a deferred sentence. As a result, Petitioner claims he has \u201can absolute constitutional right to withdraw his -56 (Fla. Dist.Ct.App.1985) (<HOLDING>); see also People v.

See ECF No. 42. 5 . Plaintiffs selectively quote this blog post in the FAC, but the Court takes judicial notice of the entire document, which is available at http:\/\/blog.linkedin.com\/2009\/03\/27\/how-to-report-abusive-behavior-on-linkedin\/, because the document has been incorporated by reference into the FAC. See infra Section II.C. 6 . In addition, Plaintiffs attach two judicial documents (an order and a complaint) to their Request for Judicial Notice, though they do not explicitly request judicial notice of these documents. See ECF No. 25-2, Exs. E-F. The Court takes judicial notice of these documents. See Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., 375 F.3d 861, 866 n. 1 (9th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). 7 . Defendants, in a footnote, move to strike recognizing that a court may take judicial notice of court filings and other matters of public recordholding that undisputed matters of public record are proper subjects for judicial noticeholding that another courts decision is a proper subject of judicial noticeholding that the existence of prior convictions are typically matters of public record of which the trial court can take judicial notice without violating the defendants right to due processholding that courts may take judicial notice of sec filings that are matters of public record & \n\n759 N.E.2d at 518; Saje Ventures II, 748 P.2d at 814. 9 See, e.g., Trustees of Cent.

District Court, 63 Nev. 249, 256-57, 167 P.2d 648, 651 (1946) (explaining that void judgments are always subject to collateral attack), overruled on other grounds by Poirier v. Bd. of Dental Examiners, 81 Nev. 384, 404 P.2d 1 (1965), overruled on other grounds by Pengilly v. Rancho Santa Fe Homeowners, 116 Nev. 646 to involuntary dismissal under NRCP 41(e), the jurisdictional implications of an NRCP 41(e) violation recognized above closely accord with the collateral effects of a voluntary dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(a)(1). See Marques v. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, 286 F.3d 1014, 1018 (7th Cir. 2002) (<HOLDING>); see also Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 holding that plaintiffs were entitled to vacate final order of dismissal as void when they did not receive the motion for dismissal or notice of the hearing on the order until after the dismissal was enteredholding that a dismissal on limitations grounds is a judgment on the meritsholding that a default judgment was not void because the bankruptcy court that entered the judgment had proper jurisdiction over the party seeking reliefrecognizing that a judgment on the merits entered after a plaintiff has filed a proper fed r civ r 41a1 notice of dismissal is voidholding that a notice of appeal is timely when filed before final judgment is entered by the district court & \n\ndate. Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim. The Walker court noted that Rule 9 was inapplicable, and held that \u201cit is enough in pleading a conspiracy to merely indicate the parties, general purpose, and approximate date, so that the defendant has notice of what he is charged with.\u201d Id. The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy. Walker, 288 F.3d at 1007; see also, Hoskins v. Poelstra, 320 F.3d 761, 764 (7th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). The other cases cited by Sanchez are also holding that more than notice to a defendant is requiredholding that a complaint under section 1983 must contain more than naked improbable unsubstantiated assertions without any specificsholding that a person alleging a conspiracy to violate constitutional rights must do more than simply aver that a conspiracy existedholding that complaint alleging a conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his civil rights cannot survive motion to dismiss based on conclusory allegations of conspiracy which are not supported by references to material factsrecognizing that ryan cannot be read to require that a complaint alleging conspiracy under 1983 contain more than notice of time scope and parties involved & \n\nthe divorce judgment, i.e., that a jurisdictional defect appeared on the face of the record. See Walker, supra. Thus, we reject any contention that the trial court lacked any evidence on which to base its finding that the father had failed to properly register the divorce judgment. The father next argues that the trial court, for a variety of reasons, erred in setting aside the 2006 modification judgment; however, the father appealed only the March 28, 2011, judgment, which dismissed only the petition for a rule nisi and the petition to modify the divorce judgment filed on August 6, 2009. We, therefore, cannot consider any arguments addressed toward the propriety of the judgment setting aside the 2006 modification judgment. See Landry v. Landry, 42 So.Sd 755, 757-58 (Ala.Civ.App.2009) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, because the trial court relied holding that the appellate court should have construed the notice of appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment as an attempt to appeal from the underlying judgmentholding that notice indicating the appeal was from summary judgment order was insufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction to reach appellants challenge to earlier order compelling arbitrationrecognizing that an appellants failure to properly file a notice of appeal as to a particular judgment prevents an appellate court from obtaining jurisdiction to review that judgmentholding that when an appeal is properly taken from an underlying judgment the court of appeals has discretion to review a subsequent order denying a motion to vacateholding the trial court was without authority to dismiss an appeal on the ground that the amount of the judgment required the appellant to file an application for discretionary review & \n\nthe facts are called adjudicative facts. 2 Kenneth S. Brown, et al., McCormick on Evidence at 385. The Railroad Commission conducted a five day hearing where the parties were represented by counsel and witnesses testified to the circumstances concerning Heritage\u2019s application to drill the 22-3 well. After the contested evidentiary proceeding, the Commission made its findings of fact and conclusions of law and executed a final order prohibiting the drilling of the 22-3 well. The final order and its accompanying PFD were duly published and are matters of public record. As such, the trial court erred in refusing to take judicial notice of the published order and PFD of the Railroad Commission. See Office of Pub. Util. Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm\u2019n of Texas, 878 S.W.2d 598, 600 (Tex.1994)(<HOLDING>) . However, because of the cumulative nature of recognizing that the court may take judicial notice of its own docketholding court of appeals erred in refusing to take judicial notice of published puc orderholding that the court of appeals erred by failing to take judicial notice of readily determinable facts contained in a published puc orderholding that cjourts may take judicial notice of facts not subject to reasonable disputeholding that the court of appeals may not overrule modify or withdraw language from a previously published decision of the court of appeals & \n\nindicia of fraud to create inquiry notice as a matter of law in Betz, UL was engaged in endorsing products for reasonably safe consumer use, and its listing of the Cadet heaters as safe, in combination with the 1999 recall, was sufficient to give Platt notice that UL\u2019s prior assurances of the heaters\u2019 safety were potentially false. It is irrelevant what else Platt might have learned through further diligent investigation after 1999 about UL\u2019s misrepresentations or intent to deceive Platt and others regarding the Cadet heaters\u2019 safety, because in 1999 Platt already knew that UL\u2019s prior representations about the heaters\u2019 safety were false, and that knowledge was sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations for fraud under California law. See Hamilton Materials, 494 F.3d at 1206-07 (<HOLDING>) (citation omitted). These cases demonstrate holding that a defendant is not entitled to relief from default judgment because notice to an attorney of filing of motions and orders is constructive notice to the client even when the client did not have actual noticeholding that the cause of action accrued on the date of saleholding in a civil rico case based upon predicate acts of mail and wire fraud that the plaintiff must plead a material misrepresentation of fact that was calculated or intended to deceive persons of reasonable prudence and comprehension and that the plaintiff relied upon that material misrepresentation to establish the fraud statutes requisite scheme to defraudholding that a plaintiff need not have notice of the defendants specific intention to deceive before the fraud action accrued all that is relevant is that a reasonable person would have been on notice of a potential misrepresentationholding that notice to supervisor is notice to city & \n\nUnited States v.

Matthews and Owens, to the contrary, actually received notice within weeks of the adoption. The DEA sent three letters to Matthews and four letters to Owens via registered mail (signed and certified return receipts are in the record), and the DEA posted notice of the forfeiture online for 30 days. See, e.g., In re $20,000 in U.S. Currency, 523 Fed.Appx. 322, 323 (6th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>); United States v. King, 442 Fed.Appx. 212, 213 holding that because the property owner argued only a theory of taking that was no longer a valid theory property owner did not demonstrate his entitlement to reliefholding that because the state failed to properly file the complaint the district court lacked jurisdiction to proceed to trialholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he was given sufficient notice of the administrative forfeiture proceeding through certified mailholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he received notice and failed to properly file a claimholding that the biological father was not entitled to notice of adoption proceeding where he failed to properly legitimate his child & \n\npresented for our consideration concern attorney\u2019s fees and costs and whether the trial court erred in failing to reserve jurisdiction over the charging lien filed by the Former Wife\u2019s counsel. We affirm the amended final judgment with the following exception. The Former Wife raises several arguments regarding the propriety of the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction her challenge to the award because, not only is the amended final judgment ambiguous regarding entitlement, the trial court reserved jurisdiction to determine the amount of fees to be awarded. Because the amount has not been determined, that portion of the amended final judgment is nonfinal and nonappealable. See McIlveen v. McIlveen, 644 So.2d 612, 612 (Fla. 2d DCA 1994) (<HOLDING>); see also Zuberer v. Zuberer, 28 So.3d 993, holding dismissal without prejudice to refile a facially sufficient motion is a nonappealable nonfinal orderholding that an order granting a motion or application to compel arbitration is nonappealable because it is not listed in the uaa arbitration provision and because it is not a final orderholding that although the trial courts failure to determine amount of fees does not render underlying order nonfinal the fee award itself is not reviewable until the amount is determinedholding that an order that determines only the right to attorneys fees without setting the amount is a nonappealable nonfinal orderholding that the dismissal of a complaint ordinarily is a nonfinal nonappealable order since amendment generally is available while dismissal of the entire action ordinarily is final & \n\n"}

Appellant contends sufficient corroborating evidence established the reliability of the proffered statements and, thus, that the trial court erred in excluding them. We hold the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the testimony of the hearsay declarant\u2014appellant\u2014was unavailable. Because appellant had complete control over his own availability as a witness, we hold that he failed as a matter of law to prove his testimony was unavailable, and we conclude the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the statements was not error. See Perry v.

The other defendants later joined in this motion. 4 . Although we reach the same result as the trial court, we do so taking a different route. \"Ordinarily, an appellate court will not affirm a summary judgment by ruling on a ground not ruled upon by the trial court.\u201d Thomas v. City of Annapolis, 113 Md.App. 440, 450, 688 A.2d 448 (1997); see also Gresser v. Anne Arundel County,-Md.-, -, -A.2d - (No. 20, Sept. Term, 1997, slip op. at 9, filed Jan. 28, 1998). \"If the alternative ground is one as to which the trial court had no discretion, however, summary judgment may be affirmed.\u201d Thomas, 113 Md.App. at 450, 688 A.2d 448; see also Maryland Cas. Co., 100 Md.App. at 357-58, 641 A.2d 924 (<HOLDING>). In this case, the trial judge would have had holding where an appellate court affirms trial courts grant of summary judgment on a particular ground the appellate court need not discuss the remaining groundsholding that an appellate court may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground appearing in the record even if the circuit court did not rely on itholding that the trial court may not grant summary judgment on a ground not raised in the motionholding that if the trial court would have had no discretion to deny summary judgment on an alternative ground the appellate court can on that alternative ground sustain the order granting summary judgmentholding that trial court may not grant summary judgment on ground not presented by movant in writing & \n\nease \u2014 at least not in the first instance. It is up to the Board, not ' the courts, to make labor policy. See Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers v. NLRB, 736 F.2d 1559, 1566 n. 5 (D.C.Cir.1984) (\u201cBecause requiring unions ... to have full time organizers present during each labor campaign raises serious questions of labor policy, it is an issue for the Board, not the courts, to settle.\u201d). Moreover, it is irrelevant that the court agrees with the Board\u2019s decision: \u201cWe emphasize that we harbor no disagreement with the Board\u2019s policy choices. We ask only for a clear statement of what those choices and the reasons for them are.\u201d Sullivan Industries, 957 F.2d at 905 n. 12; cf. Securities & Exchange Comm\u2019n. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94-95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462-63, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we remand this ease to the Board holding that court can affirm administrative order only on grounds on which agency relied and noting that the orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustainedrecognizing that this court may affirm summary judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the motion justiceholding that a motion for administrative reconsideration which congress did not order the agency to entertain which the agency dismissed in relevant part on procedural grounds and which the petitioner filed over sixty days after the agency acted cannot effectively extend retroactively the thirtyday period congress specified for judicial review petitionsholding we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record even those not relied upon by the district courtholding where movant asserts several grounds in support of its summary judgment motion and the trial court does not specify the grounds on which judgment was granted the reviewing court can affirm the judgment if any of the grounds are meritorious & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\nthe warrant. Rather, according to the trial court, the express terms of the warrant \"through inadvertence\u201d did not permit as extensive a search as was actually conducted. Thus, it appears the actual basis for the trial court's ruling was that the search exceeded the scope of a valid warrant. 3 . We do not here address the question of whether an appellee may raise an argument in defense of the lower court\u2019s judgment when that argument was not presented in the lower court. We do note, however, that our previous opinions on that question have been somewhat inconsistent. See, e.g., Buehner Block Co. v.

Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (stating that \u201csummary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition\u201d). The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\n. Appellants' own testimony at trial confirms that they experienced various health problems with the dairy herd in 2004, in addition to the unusual fluctuations in milk production which Appellants do not dispute. See supra note 6. We therefore accept the trial court's findings concerning the timing and nature of the property damage sustained by the dairy herd. As the Superior Court admirably noted, it is not the role of an appellate court to reweigh the evidence. 13 . The Superior Court\u2019s discussion of the multiple trigger theory of liability in Consulting Engineers was central to its trigger of coverage analysis in that case, and therefore carries precedential value given this Court\u2019s adoption of that court\u2019s opinion. See Commonwealth v. Tilghman, 543 Pa. 578, 673 A.2d 898, 904 (1996) (<HOLDING>). 14 . Even if we agree with Appellants that holding that notwithstanding the above and beyond language on the disposition form the discussion at resentencing revealed that the trial court understood its obligation to and its intent to give the defendant credit for time servedholding where an appellate court affirms trial courts grant of summary judgment on a particular ground the appellate court need not discuss the remaining groundsholding that appellant waived the issue on appeal by not raising it in its opening brief even though the lower courts decision was based on that pointholding that the trial court had no jurisdiction to modify its final order more than 30 days after its final judgmentholding that when this court per curiam affirms on the basis of the lower courts opinion it not only signals agreement with the result but also with the rationale employed in reaching its final disposition on matters essential to its holding & \n\nwas appropriate. 23 .

In Fullilove, the Court was faced with holding of fragmented court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest groundsrecognizing that this court may affirm summary judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the motion justiceholding where movant asserts several grounds in support of its summary judgment motion and the trial court does not specify the grounds on which judgment was granted the reviewing court can affirm the judgment if any of the grounds are meritoriousholding that when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taking by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest groundsholding of the court is the position taken by member who concurs in the judgment on the narrowest grounds & \n\nproceed, the parties agreed to seek further guidance from the family court. Husband sought that guidance, and Judge Cate provided it. The pricing scheme Judge Cate established did not conflict with the minimum listing price of $225,300 set by the divorce decree and complied with the goals set out in the parties\u2019 subsequent agreement. In light of Wife\u2019s failed attempt to sell the home for $274,000, a lower initial listing price with small periodic reductions is a reasonable approach to severing this remaining tie between Husband and Wife. Accordingly, the family court did not err. To the extent Wife requests \u201creimbursement for maintaining the marital property,\u201d this issue is unpreserved because she failed to raise it to the family court. See Chastain, 381 S.C. at 306, 672 S.E.2d at 114 (<HOLDING>). IV. Remaining Issues Wife further argues the holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate reviewholding that an issue was not preserved for appellate review because appellants trial objection does not comport with the issue he raised on appealholding an issue not raised to the family court is not preserved for appellate reviewholding that an appellate court cannot consider an issue that was not preserved for appellate reviewholding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review & \n\nit effectively reduced the rate of future benefit accruals. Foot Locker submits that the version of ERISA in effect at the time of the challenged notice did not require such disclosure, that any deficiency was cured by subsequent summary plan descriptions, and, in any event, that Osberg\u2019s \u00a7 204(h) claim is time-barred. Here, we need not determine whether Osberg\u2019s \u00a7 204(h) notice claim is either timely or valid because \u00a7 204(h) does not, in any event, afford him the remedy he seeks, i.e., a pension benefit calculated under the cash balance plan but \u201cwith an opening balance equal to the value of the retirement annuity he had already earned under the old formula.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 5. See 10 Ellicott Square Court Corp. v. Mountain Valley Indem. Co., 634 F.3d 112, 125 (2d Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>). This is because insufficient notice in recognizing this court may affirm for any reason supported by the recordholding that we may affirm a district court if its holding was right for any reasonrecognizing that the court of appeals can affirm a grant on summary judgment on any basis made apparent by the recordrecognizing that this court may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record quotation omittedrecognizing ability to affirm for any reason that finds support in record & \n\nthat would arise if we were to affirm a removal order on a ground introduced only on appeal and not raised or litigated below, see Alvarez-Santos v. INS, 332 F.3d 1245, 1252 (9th Cir.2003), the government\u2019s argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of our review. Whatever the grounds on which Al Mutarreb might have been found removable, only one was charged. We have no power to affirm the BIA on a ground never charged by the Service or found by the IJ. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (noting that a \u201ccourt is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate and proper basis\u201d not relied on by the agency); see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Nor do we accept the government\u2019s contention holding that when an ij issues a decision granting an aliens application for withholding of removal without a grant of asylum the decision must include an explicit order of removal designating a country of removalholding proof of possession of stolen goods is sufficient evidence to sustain conviction for theftholding that term order of removal does not include aliens ineffective assistance of counsel claim concerning attorneys actions taken after order of removal becomes finalholding that the defendants prior drug conviction for simple possession did not constitute a controlled substance offense because the plain language of 4b12b requires that the prior conviction involve possession with intent to distributeholding that an aliens prior possession conviction cannot sustain the removal order because it was not alleged in the nta & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nfraud claim on its findings that Chandler\u2019s claim for money from the gas and oil severance tax and from the \u201cburned out school\u201d money was based on a void contract. In its order, the trial court found \u201cthat plaintiff [Chandler] would not be able to assert fraud based upon a fraudulent inducement to enter into a contract to pay a portion of revenue monies since the former has been determined to be a void contract as against public policy.\u201d In light of our holdings in parts I, II, and III, we conclude that the reasoning given by the trial court in support of the summary judgment on the fraud claim was incorrect. The question then becomes whether the summary judgment can be sustained on any other grounds. See Lowe v. East End Memorial Hosp. & Health Centers, 477 So.2d 339 (Ala.1985) (<HOLDING>). After reviewing the record and the holding that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court is limited to the grounds raised in the motionholding that a trial court can only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgmentholding summary judgment must be upheld if it is proper on any groundsholding that on appeal a summary judgment ruling will be upheld if it can be sustained on any grounds even if the trial court gave an incorrect reason for its rulingholding that a trial courts ruling on a motion for new trial will be upheld if it is correct on any applicable legal theory even if the court articulated an invalid basis & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v. Thompson, 710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983))); McRae v. United States, 420 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nalso claims that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument concerning his prior convictions. According to defendant, the State\u2019s comment was improper in that it called attention to the fact that his prior convictions were of the same crime with which he was charged here. Defendant waived this argument. In order to preserve an error for review, a defendant must both object to the alleged error at trial and renew the objection in his written posttrial motion. People v. Hunter, 331 Ill. App. 3d 1017, 1029 (2002); People v. Bennett, 304 Ill. App. 3d 69, 71 (1999). In this case, defendant failed to preserve this error for review because he did not object to the State\u2019s comment at the time it was made and he abandoned his posttrial motions. See Land, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 256 (<HOLDING>). Defendant claims that any failure to object holding that failure to file a postjudgment motion on alleged error of law relating to ruling on exception to the statute of frauds that was committed for first time in the judgment waives any objection to that ruling and that in the absence of any other formal objection the issue is not preserved for appellate reviewholding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate reviewholding that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court is limited to the grounds raised in the motionholding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the failure to obtain a ruling on a motion for new trial waives the issues raised for appellate review & \n\n21, 2012, supplement and treated that supplement as a Rule 60(b), Ala.

Noll, 47 So.3d 275, 278-79 (Ala.Civ.App.2010) (<HOLDING>); (3) it was untimely because it was not filed holding that where a court considering a rule 12b6 motion relies on matters outside the pleading the motion must be treated as a rule 56 motion for summary judgmentholding that motion to dismiss cannot be treated as summary judgmentholding that a rule 12b6 motion to dismiss should be treated as a motion for summary judgment when plaintiffs counsel relied upon facts outside the four corners of the complaint during oral argument of the motionholding that a motion that alleged rule 60b1 grounds could not be treated as a rule 60b6 motion in the absence of allegations of aggravating circumstancesholding that when ruling on a motion under rule 60b1 the trial court is not required to make written findings of fact unless a request is made & \n\nWhen Asbill initially entered the hotel\u2019s office, Cruel was the only employee present, which represented to third parties that she was in charge. Asbill testified that Patidar told him that he could leave the papers with Cruel or that he could come back. Patidar similarly testified that he told Asbill it was up to him whether to leave the papers. Under these facts, we find that Patidar knowingly permitted Cruel to exercise authority to accept service of process and further find that his manifestations to Asbill indicated that Cruel had such authority. For these reasons, we hold that evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that Cruel was authorized to accept service. Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 583, 560 S.E.2d 624, 631 (Ct.App.2001) (<HOLDING>). II.

Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000) (internal quotations omitted). A motion to dismiss may only be granted where the allegations fail to state any claim upon which relief can be granted. See Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.1997). Dismissal is warranted \u201cif it is certain that no relief can be granted under any set of facts which could be proved.\u201d Klein v. General Nutrition Cos., Inc., 186 F.3d s Brennan and its progeny too broadly. Specifically, Hartford asserts that where a dispute centers on whether a particular policy provision is contrary to a constitutional, legislative or administrative mandate, the controversy may be subject to judicial review. See, e.g., Warner v. Continental\/CNA Ins. Cos., 455 Pa.Super. 295, 688 A.2d 177, 181 (1996) (<HOLDING>). In view of this exception, Hartford maintains holding that where a contract containing an arbitration clause is challenged as unconscionable those disputes should first be resolved by an arbitratorrecognizing general rulerecognizing exception to general rule that disputes arising under contract with valid arbitration clause are referred to arbitratorholding that an arbitrator not a federal or state court will resolve questions concerning validity in the first instance when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contractholding defenses concerning the contract as a whole must be referred to ah arbitrator while defenses to the arbitration provision itself are considered by the court & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa.

Nothing in Green\u2019s EEOC charge related to incidents of harassment, nor did anything mention the dates on which they occurred. Because the facts alleged in Green\u2019s EEOC charge form cannot be said to encompass a hostile work environment claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that his claim was therefore procedurally deficient. See Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 466 (explaining that a Title VII complaint may encompass only the kinds of discrimination like or related to the allegations contained in the EEOC charge).

Boumehdi v. Plastag Holdings, LLC, 489 F.3d 781, 788 (7th Cir.2007). To satisfy the third prong, Wheeler must demonstrate that Antonacci\u2019s behavior was both objectively and subjectively offensive. Rhodes v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 359 F.3d 498, 505 (7th Cir.2004). Wheel er\u2019s August 2007 complaint to Stobba provides sufficient evidence that she was subjectively offended by Antonacci\u2019s comments, and Brady does not claim otherwise. See Hostetler v. Quality Dining, Inc., 218 F.3d 798, 807 (7th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Courts look to several factors to determine holding that plaintiffs allegations of loosely related actions that she perceived to be hostile to her based on her race are insufficient to meet the heavy burden required to prove hostile environmentrecognizing that a jury reasonably could find based on an employees complaints to a superior that the employee perceived her environment as hostileholding that supervisors routine vulgar references to plaintiff could not support a hostile work environment claim because plaintiff was unaware of the comments and to show that he or she perceived the environment as hostile a title vii plaintiff must at least have been aware of those commentsholding that a viable hostile work environment claim requires an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusiveholding that the fact that the offensive material was not directed specifically at the plaintiff does not as a matter of law preclude a jury from finding that the conduct subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her sex & \n\non any of her claims against Legg Mason. Based on this disposition on the merits, the Court need not reach Defendants\u2019 additional arguments concerning timeliness, administrative exhaustion, and the effect of the release of liability. Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. #49] is granted. The Clerk is directed to close this case. IT IS SO ORDERED. 1 . See, e.g., Rogers v. Apicella, 606 F.Supp.2d 272, 284-85 (D.Conn.2009). 2 . Sacco brings discrimination claims under both Title VII and New York State Human Rights Law. Because claims under both statutes are analyzed under the same framework, Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000), the claims will be grouped together here. 3 . See Petrosino v. Bell Atlantic, 385 F.3d 210, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). \"The critical issue\u201d in such a case \"is holding that the plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies and it does not matter that the plaintiff was using state law as the vehicle to press her assertionholding that a single offensive racist comment was not sufficient to establish a hostile work environmentholding that referring to a female colleague as dancing girl or call girl ignoring her except to comment on her appearance and another female employees quitting because of the same person was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment because the offensive utterances do not rise to the level required by the supreme courts definition of a hostile work environmentrecognizing that a jury reasonably could find based on an employees complaints to a superior that the employee perceived her environment as hostileholding that the fact that the offensive material was not directed specifically at the plaintiff does not as a matter of law preclude a jury from finding that the conduct subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her sex & \n\nage, race and sex discrimination are completely unrelated to Reno\u2019s allegations that she was harassed by Moorer, that Moorer \u201cfrequently makes rude, disparaging remarks about women and twists every innocent comment into one with sexual over tones\u201d and that Moorer \u201capproached Ms. Reno from behind and intentionally pressed himself against her with his lower body while she is sitting at her desk.\u201d (P.\u2019s Sec. Am. Compl., Instr. No. 18 at 6). Moorer was not involved in any of Metro\u2019s decisions not to promote Reno nor is it reasonable to assume that his allegedly unlawful conduct would have been uncovered during the course of an EEOC investigation aimed at discovering whether Reno had been improperly denied certain promotions. See Torriero v. Olin Corp., 684 F.Supp. 1165, 1170 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, Reno argues that the claim of holding that plaintiffs eeoc charge alleging sex discrimination did not encompass claim of sexual harassment subsequently asserted in title vii action in federal court because the facts underlying sexual harassment claim could not be inferred from the factual assertions made in the eeoc charge nor would they have been uncovered absent specific allegations to indicate such a cause of action existedholding that a charge that alleged discrimination on the basis of sex did not support a complaint for hostile environment sexual harassmentholding that an original eeoc charge is sufficient to support a civil suit under the act for any discrimination developed in the course of a reasonable investigation of that charge provided such discrimination was included in the reasonable cause determination of the eeocholding that eeoc charge filed by plaintiff more than 180 days after alleged incident of sexual harassment was timely where alleged sexual harassment violation continued as hostile work environment through time of plaintiffs terminationholding that a title vii cause of action is limited to those discrimination allegations in the complaint that have been under the scrutiny of a formal eeoc complaint & \n\nconduct varies inversely with the pervasiveness or frequency of the conduct\u201d); see also Jacob v.

Essex Group, Inc., 937 F.2d 1264, 1274 n. 4 (7th Cir.1991) (recognizing that single, isolated incident of harassment can give rise to employer liability for racial harassment under Title VII). 119 F.3d at 873. While there is no minimum number of incidents, where a plaintiff alleges few incidents, they must be severe to establish a hostile work environment. See, e.g., Lowe v. Angelo\u2019s Italian Foods, Inc., 87 F.3d 1170, 1175 (10th Cir.1996)(<HOLDING>); Creamer v.

Catalyst Technology, Inc., 302 F.3d 474, 478 (5th Cir.2002). If this determination is answered in the affirmative, the court must decide whether the challenged conduct meets the applicable standards for either a quid pro quo or hostile environment claim. For example, same-sex harassment that is \u2018severe or. pervasive\u2019 enough to create a hostile environment ... might be excluded from the coverage of [T]itle VII because it was not discriminatory on the basis of sex. On the other hand, same-sex harassment that is indisputably discriminatory might not be serious enough to make out either a quid pro quo or hostile environment claim. Id. (citation omitted). See, e.g., Davis v. Coastal Int\u2019l Security, Inc., 275 F.3d 1119, 1126 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The Court\u2019s first task is to determine holding that transsexuals are not a protected class under title vii in response to the plaintiffs argument that because a persons identity as a transsexual is directly connected to the sex organs she possesses discrimination on this basis must constitute discrimination because of sexrecognizing that a plaintiff can demonstrate that samesex harassment is because of sex by showing that the conduct was motivated by the coworkers sexual desire for persons of the same sexholding that retaliation claim was reasonably related to prior sex discrimination claimholding discrimination based on pregnancy was not sex discriminationholding that actions of plaintiffs coworkers which included slashing plaintiffs tires grabbing their crotches and making kissing gestures and uttering a phrase used to describe oral sex however vulgar did not constitute discrimination because of sex & \n\n626 (8th Cir.2000) (finding that employee\u2019s \u201cfrustrating work situation\u201d characterized by her being excluded from the decision-making process, treated with disrespect, subjected to false complaints, and curtailed in her supervisory duties did not amount to hostile work environment), abrogated on other grounds by Torgerson, 643 F.3d at 1042-43, 1058; Breeding v. Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., 164 F.3d 1151, 1159 (8th Cir.1999) (concluding that unfair criticism and being yelled at did not amount to actionable harassment); see also Martinelli v. Penn Miller Ins. Co., 269 Fed.Appx. 226, 228 (3d Cir.2008) (finding that employer\u2019s scrutiny of employee\u2019s work, \u201cwhile unpleasant and annoying\u201d did not amount to hostile work environment); Harbuck v. Teets, 152 Fed.Appx. 846, 847-48 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Here, based on the evidence in the record, holding that employers conduct including keeping workplace too cold subjecting employee to heightened scrutiny and disclosing information from plaintiffs prior lawsuit to her coworkers did not constitute a hostile work environmentholding that coworkers cartoon ridiculing plaintiffs depression does not support a hostile work environment claimholding that plaintiffs allegation that her professor gave her a brief bear hug was insufficient to constitute a hostile work environmentholding that a plaintiffs psychological distress was not vicarious in a hostile work environment case where she experienced her workplace as hostile by reason of the alleged harassment of other women out of her presencerecognizing a hostile work environment claim under section 1983 & \n\nisolated incidents within the requisite level. They were neither frequent, severe nor physically threatening. Similarly, none of the other allegedly harassing conduct relied on by plaintiff was sufficiently severe and pervasive to be actionable. According to plaintiff, she spends between 70% to 75% of her time away from the office. Her deposition testimony establishes that during the limited time that she was in her office, she was not required to work with or around Brown and that she could have easily avoided contact with Brown in most instances by using a different entrance. Under these circumstances, a reasonable person would not have found her work environment hostile or abusive. Cf. Caleshu v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 737 F.Supp. 1070, 1082-83 (E.D.Mo.1990) (<HOLDING>). As a result, plaintiff has failed to holding single incident of sexual harassment was neither sufficiently pervasive nor severe to constitute a hostile work environmentholding that harassing conduct not sufficiently severe and pervasive where conduct would not have affected the work environment of a reasonable personholding that plaintiffs work environment was not affected by comments and conduct of which she was not awareholding that a claim of constructive discharge requires a showing of harassment that is more severe and pervasive than that required to show a hostile work environmentholding that plaintiff did not establish a severe or pervasive hostile work environment where the complained of conduct was episodic but not so frequent as to become pervasive was never severe was never physically threatening though occasionally discomforting or mildly humiliating and significantly was never according to the record an impediment to the plaintiffs work performance & \n\nthat \"gender\" connotes cultural or attitudinal characteristics distinctive to the sexes, as opposed to their physical characteristics. See, e.g., Mary Anne C. Case, Disaggregating Gender Prom Sex and Sexual Orientation: The Effeminate Man in the Law and Feminist Jurisprudence, 105 Yale L.J. 1 (1995) (\"gender [is] to sex what masculine and feminine are to male and female\u201d). See also JEB v. Alabama, - U.S. -, -n. 1, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 1436 n. 1, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994) (Scalia, J., dissenting). While it may be useful to disaggregate the definition of \"gender\u201d from \"sex\u201d for some purposes, in this opinion we make no such effort, using the terms interchangeably to refer to whether an employee is a man or a woman. 2 . Compare, e.g., Sardinia v. Dellwood Foods, Inc., 1995 WL 640502 (S.D.N.Y.1995) (<HOLDING>) and Griffith v. Keystone Steel & Wire, 887 holding that samcscx sexual harassment claims are actionable under title viiholding that samesex sexual harassment claims are not actionable under title viiholding that sexual harassment need not take the form of sexual advances or other explicitly sexual conduct in order to be actionable under title viiholding that noneconomic injury resulting from a hostile environment based on discriminatory sexual harassment is actionable under title viiholding that title vii does not protect employees from harassment based on sexual orientation & \n\nFirst, the proposed Second Amended Complaint makes clear that Plaintiff was separated from her colleagues before she brought her discrimination claim to HR. See id. \u00b6 17 (alleging that Groff \u201csegregated\u201d Plaintiff \u201c[s]hortly after denying [her] request for a promotion\u201d). Accordingly, there can be no causal relationship between her complaint to HR and that conduct. Second, Plaintiff does not specify when Defendant reduced her break time or subjected her attendance to more scrutiny, so the court cannot infer that those actions arose in response to her protected activity. In any event, even if those acts did commence after Plaintiff first exercised her statutory rights, they do not support a hostile work environment claim. See Veitch v. England, 471 F.3d 124, 130-31 (D.G. Cir. 2006) (<HOLDING>); Hussain v. Gutierrez, 593 F.Supp.2d 1, 7 holding that a failure to make out a hostile work environment claim effectively disposes of the constructive discharge claim as wellrecognizing that a constructive discharge claim and a hostile work environment claim are not equivalent because a constructive discharge claim imposes a higher standardholding defendants belief that his work was unfairly criticized is not sufficient for constructive dischargeholding that nonselection for a desirable position assignment to undesirable duties sharing a small office and being criticized did not make out a hostile work environment causing constructive dischargeholding that a claim of constructive discharge requires a showing of harassment that is more severe and pervasive than that required to show a hostile work environment & \n\nCURIAM. Opal Coleman appeals from an order of the District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas granting summary judgment in favor of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Varner Unit (ADC), in her Title VII action alleging discrimination and constructive discharge on the basis of her race (African-American). For reversal, Coleman argues that (1) the district court erroneously construed her complaint as simply raising claims of a hostile work environment and constructive discharge, rather than discrimination; (2) she produced sufficient evidence of d 6 (8th Cir. 1997) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the holding that selfserving deposition testimony standing alone is insufficient to survive a motion for summary judgmentholding affidavits based on conclusory allegations insufficient at summary judgmentholding that party may not rely on conclusory statements or an argument that the affidavits in support of the motion for summary judgment are not credibleholding that affidavits that are conclusory and based on hearsay can not be used to oppose motion for summary judgmentholding conclusory statements in affidavits and deposition testimony standing alone are insufficient to withstand a properlysupported motion for summary judgment & \n\nanother department and had previously received ratings of \"3\u201d and \"4 \". Bob Laird, who was also already a supervisor when he was transferred to be special services department supervisor had consistently received \u201c4\u201d ratings. Chris Scafidi, a Caucasian male who has held the position since August 1994 had received only \"3\u201d and \"4\" ratings and had two years experience working at the special services desk. (Home Depot\u2019s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts at pp. 7-9; Teixeira Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 20-25). 9 . Courts have commonly applied the same standard of liability for employment discrimination cases alleging Title VII and Section 1981 violations because the elements of each are the same. New York City Transit Authority v. Beazer, 440 U.S. 568, 583, 99 S.Ct. 1355, 1364-65, 59 L.Ed.2d 587 (1979) (<HOLDING>); Lincoln v. Board of Regents, 697 F.2d 928 holding that title vii precludes a claim under section 1981 for racial discrimination against a federal employeeholding that section 1981 afford no greater substantive protection than title viiholding that plaintiffs claims under 42 usc 1981 are also governed by the special venue provision of title viiholding that a title vii plaintiff could not hold coworkers liable in their individual capacities under title viiholding that there is no individual liability under title vii & \n\nfor an employer\u2019s liability. An employer is directly liable for hostile environment sexual harassment if it knew, or upon reasonably diligent inquiry should have known, of the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. See Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.1989); Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11th Cir.1982). Under this theory of direct liability, the City can be held liable for its own negligence or recklessness, but not for the conduct of its supervisors or employees. In contrast, an employer is indirectly, or vicariously, liable for the wrongful conduct of its agent, whether or not the employer knew or should have known about the agent\u2019s 6-07 (4th Cir.1989), vacated in part, 900 F.2d 27 (4th Cir.1990)(<HOLDING>); Hicks v.

City of Augusta, 174 Kan. 324, 332, 256 P.2d 121 (1953). In most tort cases, prejudgment interest is not appropriate under K.S.A. \u00a7 16-201 because the amount of damages due a plaintiff are not \u201cfixed and certain\u201d until a jury resolves questions of fact and the court enters judgment. See, e.g., Whittenburg v. L.J. Holding Co., 838 F.Supp. 519, 519 (D.Kan.1993) (<HOLDING>); Torre v. Federated Mutual Ins.

Bergmann v. Boyce, 109 Nev. 670, 679, 856 P.2d 560, 565-66 (1993). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in awarding IOV2 percent interest on the judgment rather than the statutory rate, and reverse and remand this portion of the judgment with instructions to amend the award by applying the statutory rate. Prejudgment interest on costs Appellants maintain that the district court order can be read to require prejudgment interest on the award of costs since it provides that interest on the entire judgment should be awarded from the date of service of the complaint. First, appellants argue that interest should not be awarded on costs at all. See National Educators Life Insurance Company v.

In reaching this conclusion, we place considerable emphasis on the nature of the funds that the Commissioner found taxable. Section 104(a)(2) excludes from taxation \u201cthe amount of any damages received ... on account of personal injury or sickness.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Language is not infinitely elastic, and here, the disputed prejudgment interest simply does not comprise \u201cdamages\u201d within the meaning of section 104(a)(2). We explain briefly. Under the applicable Rhode Island statute, prejudgment interest is awarded in all civil cases, not just in personal injury cases. See R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 9-21-10. This interest is separate and distinct from damages, and is awarded mainly to compensate for delay in payment. See Foster v. Quigley, 94 R.I. 217, 179 A.2d 494, 495 (1962) (<HOLDING>); accord Balian v. Allstate Ins.

Upon appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the matter with some instructions.

However, as mentioned above, we have specifically held that arbitrators have the authority to award prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits and \u201cthat; arbitrators should add prejudgment interest to their awards unless the parties specifically provide otherwise by agreement.\u201d Sentry, 556 A.2d at 1000 (quoting Paola, 461 A.2d at 937) (emphasis added). Thus, we hold that defendant\u2019s argument that the arbitrator- awarded on a matter not submitted to him has no merit. Furthermore, we hold that any argument that defendant makes pursuant to the application of Massachusetts law was waived because it was not submitted to the arbitrator. See Aponik, 844 A.2d at 706 (<HOLDING>). The defendant admitted in the trial court and holding defendant liable for attorneys fees when the guaranty contract at issue provided for the payment of collection costs and expensesrecognizing that an award of temporary attorneys fees and costs is based on an assessment of need and ability to pay as well as the reasonableness of the fees and costsholding that the failure to request attorneys fees and costs during arbitration waived any rights provided by the mechanics lien statuteholding that where the arbitration agreement was silent on feesplitting and the costs imposed upon the plaintiff by the aaa were not prohibitive the plaintiff had presented little evidence to indicate that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive and the fees and costs of arbitration did not render the arbitration scheme unconscionableholding that oncors request for the trial judge rather than the jury to determine the reasonableness of its attorneys fees and the failure to submit the question of attorneys fees to the jury resulted in a waiver of oncors claim for the recovery of attorneys fees & \n\nexemption statutes like Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 513.-430(10)(e). A credible argument against ERISA\u2019s preemption of such state exemption statutes exists and has been adopted by what one court has called an \u201cemerging minority.\u201d In re Kazi, 125 B.R. 981 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.1991). The Eighth Circuit has recently resolved this issue against the position taken by the trustee, by holding, \u201c... ERISA does not preempt state law exemptions of pension plan benefits reasonably necessary for the support of a debtor.\u201d In re Vickers, 954 F.2d 1426 (8th Cir.1992). However, when the Debtors asserted their exemptions the courts within the Eighth Circuit that had considered this pre-emption question had reached conflicting results and the Circuit Court had not yet ruled. See In re Gaines, 121 B.R. 1015 (W.D.Mo.1990) (<HOLDING>), compare, In re Vickers, 116 B.R. 149 holding that erisa completely preempted certain state law claims and finding that erisa preempted an employees common law tort and contract claim when the employee sought benefits under the employers disability policyholding a state workers compensation regime preempted by erisa to the extent state law applied to pension plans governed by federal lawholding that erisa does not preempt revstatmo 51343010e because it is entirely consistent with both erisa and the bankruptcy codeholding that to the extent revstatmo 51343010e affects erisa it is preemptedholding that a state election law is preempted only to the extent that it conflicts with federal law & \n\nwas sufficiently included in the requested property division, Kelly does not contend that a request for property division is sufficient to provide notice that she sought payment of spousal maintenance following the property division. Outside the default-judgment context, some courts have held that absent special exceptions, a prayer for general relief will support an award of any relief raised by the evidence. See, e.g., Khalaf v. Williams, 814 S.W.2d 854, 858 (Tex.App.Houston [1st Dist.] 1991, no writ). The relief must also be consistent with the allegations in the petition, however. Id.; Hardin v.

Sandra filed a motion to amend the judgment, arguing that the court should reverse its award of interest on the $6,693 it awarded to the IRS. Sandra also moved the court to award her interest, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411, on the funds that the IRS would have to return to her. The court granted Sandra\u2019s motion in part, deleting the interest awarded to the IRS, but denied her request for interest. The government filed a timely notice of appeal and Sandra filed a timely notice of cross-appeal in June 1999. In October 1999, the government petitioned this court for en banc review of the Craft I decision. The government argued that the Craft I decision \u2014 as well Cole v. Cardoza, 441 F.2d 1337 (6th Cir.1971) (<HOLDING>), a prior decision upon which the Craft I court holding that when the united states held a senior tax lien it was an indispensable party under the controlling federal tax lawholding that the right to disclaim property under state law does not defeat a federal tax lien because the taxpayer exercised control over the disposition of the propertyholding that under michigan law tenants in the entirety possess sufficient property interests for federal tax liens to attachholding that no tax liens may attach to property after the fdic acquired titleholding that federal government may not under michigan law attach lien to entireties property to satisfy individual tax liability of one spouse & \n\nthere is consensus about a starting point. Courts agree that a \u201cmarket\u201d rate of interest should apply. See Koopmans, 102 F.3d at 874-75; In re Smithwick, 121 F.3d at 214; In re Valenti, 105 F.3d at 63; GMAC, 999 F.2d at 66-67; United Carolina Bank, 993 F.2d at 1129-30; In re Fowler, 903 F.2d 694, 697 (9th Cir.1990); In re Hardzog, 901 F.2d at 859-60; Arnold, 878 F.2d at 927-28; see also Pearson, supra at 40-41; Epstein, supra at 443. There is disagreement, however, about what rate of interest will adequately ensure that the creditor receives full value of his secured claim. 1. Under one approach, known as the \u201ccost of funds method,\u201d the interest rate is set at the rate the creditor would have to pay to borrow the amount equal to the collateral\u2019s value. See In re Valenti 105 F.3d at 64 (<HOLDING>); 8 Lawrence P. King et al., Collier on holding that although cost of funds approach more appropriately reflects the present value of a creditors allowed claim it is difficult to administer and therefore the interest rate should be fixed at the rate on a united states treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtors reorganization planholding that bankruptcy plan of reorganization rather than 1961 controlled the setting of the interest rateholding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that the proper rate for prejudgment interest is the rate fixed by the parties in a contract & \n\nHe did not provide all of the documents responsive to the request until August 27, 1993, more than seven months after the demand was made. Moskowitz therefore violated his duty of disclosure under ERISA and his conduct gives rise to liability under \u00a7 1132(c)(1). Because the award of penalties is committed to the sound discretion of the Court, I must determine whether Moskow-itz\u2019s conduct warrants imposition of such a penalty. In determining whether to assess a penalty under \u00a7 1132(c)(1) courts have considered such factors as bad faith or intentional conduct on the part of the administrator, the length of the delay, the number of requests made and documents withheld, and the existence of any prejudice to the participant or beneficiary. See Ziaee v. Vest, 916 F.2d 1204 (7th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied 499 U.S. 959, 111 S.Ct. 1581, holding that in exercise of its discretion district court may consider factors such as number of requests made and number of documents withheldholding that district court may consider documents referred to in plaintiffs complaint and central to his claimrecognizing that district court in exercise of its rule 16b discretion may consider other relevant factors including in particular whether allowing the amendment of the pleading at this stage of the litigation will prejudice defendantsholding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that a district court may depart upward based upon a significant number of fraudulent schemes conducted by the defendant & \n\nthat only rules of damages are substantive. Prior to Monessen, the United States Supreme Court had already decided that prejudgment interest is a form of \u201cactual damages\u201d and that damages are substantive. See id. Thus, no further analysis was needed to determine that prejudgment interest was substantive. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has found other state laws that have no relationship to damages to be substantive in FELA cases. See, e.g., Dice v. Akron, Canton & Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S. 359, 363, 72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398 (1952) (concluding that the right to have a jury decide factual issues of fraud is \u201ctoo substantial a part of the rights accorded by [FELA] to permit it to be classified as a mere local rule of procedure\u2019 \u201d); Brown, 338 U.S. at 299, 70 S.Ct. 105 (<HOLDING>); White, 238 U.S. at 511-12, 35 S.Ct. 865 holding that state courts must apply the federal pleading standard in fela casesholding that in diversity cases federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural lawholding that litigants may enforce fela in state courts as a matter of right but also observing that state courts are free to apply their own modes of procedure to fela casesrecognizing that the federal pleading standard is a less stringent standard than the delaware pleading standardholding that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity cases & \n\n344, 354 (1910) (noting that it is the prerogative of the civil courts to determine the meaning and legal effect of civil contracts). An aggrieved party, including a criminal defendant, remains free to seek enforcement of the terms of a release in civil court. Our criminal courts are permitted to take note of these agreements in deciding whether to order restitution and in what amount, but these agreements in no way preclude a criminal court from ordering restitution when appropriate under statute. Id. In essence, the Haltom court upheld a restitution order in the amount of the victim\u2019s medical expenses and lost earnings even though the victim had also received $100,000 \u2014 the limit of Haltom\u2019s policy\u2014 from Haltom\u2019s insurer. See also Crawford v. State, 770 N.E.2d 775, 781 (Ind.2002) (<HOLDING>). We are mindful, however, that elementary holding that restitution is a criminal penalty that negates the imposition of prejudgment interestholding civil restitution judgment that was originally imposed as part of a criminal sentence nondisehargeableholding that imposition of punishment is a judicial functionrecognizing criminal forfeiture as an aspect of punishmentholding that civil settlements have no bearing on decisions of criminal punishment and imposition of a restitution order is a form of punishment and part of a criminal sentence & \n\nis most commonly used in other contexts to refer to proceedings initiated before a court. See Iowa Code \u00a7 611.2 (\"A civil action is a proceeding in a court of justice in which one party, known as the plaintiff, demands against another party, known as the defendant, the enforcement or protection of a private right, or the prevention or redress of a private wrong.\u201d) (emphasis added); see also Kelso v.

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

The Eighth Circuit, in In re Kline, 65 F.3d 749, 751 (8th Cir.1995), specifically considered whether holdings under the prior Act remained vital under the Code. The Kline court held that \u201cthe statute continues to except from discharge attorney fees, even if payable to an attorney rather than to a former spouse, if su 3), the Fifth Circuit considered the dischargeability of a child\u2019s guardian ad litem fees and an ex-spouse\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees in a custody proceeding following a divorce.

We do not presume to draft precise disclaimers for each of appellants\u2019 four claims; we leave that task to the agency in the first instance. Nor do we rule out the possibility that where evidence in support of a claim is outweighed by evidence against the claim, the FDA could deem it incurable by a disclaimer and ban it outright. For example, if the weight of the evidence were against the hypothetical claim that \u201cConsumption of Vitamin E reduces the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d the agency might reasonably determine that adding a disclaimer such as \u201cThe FDA has determined that no evidence supports this claim\u201d would not suffice to mitigate the claim\u2019s misleadingness. Cf. FTC v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 778 F.2d 35, 42-43 (D.C.Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). Finally, while we are skeptical that the holding that defendants statement that it owned the rights to a trademark did not give rise to a false advertising claim under the lanham actholding in a false advertising case under the lanham act that a proposed disclaimer would not suffice to cure the misleadingness of an advertising claimholding that there must be a causal connection between an insureds advertising and an alleged injury to trigger coverage for an advertising injuryholding that both lanham act false advertising claim and a false advertising claim made under section 349 or section 350 require a showing that the advertisement was false or misleadingholding that while under a false association claim parties need not be direct competitors under a false advertising claim they do & \n\nentities like GasPlus. See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The causation requirement is satisfied holding a deviation from the terms of a contract constitutes an impairment of contractholding that even though an executive order mandating agency consideration of environmental justice concerns created no private right of action for an agencys failure to comply with that mandate the court would review the agencys action as an exercise of discretion under the apa and nepaholding that the evidence must be sufficient to support the agencys findings of fact and that the agencys inferences from those facts must be reasonableholding that an agencys interference with a private partys contract rights constitutes an injury in factholding that potential loss of a contract constitutes irreparable injury & \n\nstate law that required parents to send their children to a public school for a period of time because it \u201cunreasonably interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct the upbringing and education of children under their control\u201d); Wisconsin v.

As a result, the alleged implied message could not be proven false. In any event, even if PBM\u2019s \u201ccompare to\u201d messages were false, the district court correctly concluded that Mead Johnson cannot prove that the \u201ccompare to\u201d language caused any damages.

As such, she can recover for emotional distress damages under the ACA. 2. California\u2019s Unruh Civil Rights Act Claim RCHSD argues that Ms. Prescott lacks standing to assert an Unruh Civil Rights Act claim on behalf of Kyler and herself. Because she does not seek to bring an action as an individual, the Court need only address her ability to assert an Unruh Act claim on behalf of Kyler. RCHSD relies on cases that address an organization\u2019s standing under Unruh to argue that Ms. Prescott lacks standing to assert a claim on behalf of Kyler.

With respect to the latter requirement, the Supreme Court has held that [a] private plaintiff may not recover damages under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act merely by showing \u201cinjury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market.\u201d Instead, a plaintiff must prove the existence of \u201cantitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d Atlantic Richfield Co., 495 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1884 (quoting Brunswick Corp. 429 U.S. at 489, 97 S.Ct. 690 (internal citations omitted)); see also J.

Nonetheless, a review of the standing capacities traditionally available to plaintiff states confirms that Congress intended to permit parens patriae actions when it authorized state governments to bring suit under Title VII. In Connecticut ex rel. Blumenthal v. Cahill, 217 F.3d 93, 97 (2d Cir.2000), the Second Circuit held that \u201cPlaintiff-States generally bring suit in the federal courts in one of three standing capacities: (1) proprietary suits in which the State sues much like a private party suffering a direct, tangible injury; (2) sovereignty suits requesting adjudication of boundary disputes or water rights, or (3) parens patriae suits in which States h Cir.1976) (<HOLDING>); Gray v.

In contrast to this ease, in Short the Claims Court found jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, not the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505. See Short, 12 Cl.Ct. at 40 (\u201c[Plaintiffs are suing as individuals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1982).\u201d).

Some courts refer to the process of opting in to a collective action as \"joinder.\u201d See Grayson v. K Mart Corp., 79 F.3d 1086, 1096 (11th Cir. 1996) (Garth, J.) (referring to a certification of an ADEA collective action as \"permitting opt-in joinder of \u2018similarly situated\u2019 plaintiffs\u201d). But opt-in plaintiffs are held to a lesser standard than FLSA named plaintiffs or other plaintiffs who jo.in in .civil actions. For instance, ADEA opt-in plaintiffs do not need to exhaust administrative remedies, while ADEA named plaintiffs do. See Lusardi v. Lechner, 855 F.2d 1062, 1078 (3d Cir. 1988) (<HOLDING>).

Accordingly, it is preempted. The determination of whether CoStar\u2019s remaining state claims are preempted similarly turns on whether they arise solely from copying or whether they require additional elements. CoStar characterizes its unjust enrichment claim as based not on the copyright infringement, but rather upon misattribution of source arising from its Lanham Act claims. Paper no. 94, at 36. In Wharton, however, the court held that the plaintiffs claim of unjust enrichment was preempted by the Copyright Act because it \u201cconcerns the central allegation that Defendants plagiarized his copyrighted screenplay.\u201d Wharton, 907 F.Supp. at 146; see also American Movie Classics, 922 F.Supp. at 934 (<HOLDING>).

Title II prohibits discrimination against a disabled individual regarding access to public services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 (\u201cNo qualified individual with a disability shall ... be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d). The public entities defined in the ADA are state or local governments and their instrumentalities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1). The United States, its agencies, and employees are not public entities under the ADA. Cellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC, 217 F.3d 72, 73 (2d Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Aquino v. Prudential Life & Cas. Ins.

As we have stressed in its application, Article 4 is about access to the judicial branch to enforce the law. See Holton v. Dep\u2019t of Emp\u2019t & Training, 2005 VT 42, \u00b6 27, 178 Vt. 147, 878 A.2d 1051. We cannot believe that the drafters of Article 4 intended that judicial access be denied by legislative inaction in creating an enforcement mechanism. Indeed, denial of access to the courts is a violation of the substantive requirements of the Article. \u00b6 51. The principles of due process have been developed and applied in thousands of decis (stating that \u201cprohibitive clauses of the constitution such as the due process clause are self-executing and require no legislation for their enforcement\u201d); Dorwart v. Caraway, 2002 MT 240, \u00b620, 58 P.3d 128 (<HOLDING>). For example, in Spackman v. Board of holding that pretrial detainees can bring substantive due process claimrecognizing that plaintiff can bring action under due process clause of state constitutionholding that a conflict of interest on the part of the prosecution violates the due process clause of the virginia constitutionrecognizing exception under state constitutionrecognizing that the due process guaranteed under the alabama constitution is coextensive with the due process guaranteed under the united states constitution & \n\nPlaintiffs have satisfied this requirement of Rule 23, notwithstanding Defendants\u2019 arguments to the contrary. In particular, I find that BPI Global has constitutional and statutory standing and would be an adequate class representative in this case. a. Article III Standing (\u201cInjury-in-Fact\u201d) Defendants\u2019 argument that BPI Global does not have constitutional standing ignores the fact that BPI Global is a direct investor in several of the funds for which it served as investment advisor. Defendants argue that because BPI Global was a mere advisor (through BPI Capital) to the mutual funds for which it purchased Sonus stock, it never suffered any injury itself. They rely upon a recent ease denying standing to an investment advisor. See In re Tyco Int\u2019l, Ltd., 236 F.R.D. 62, 73 (D.N.H.2006) (<HOLDING>). However, Tyco is inapplicable in this case holding that article iii standing is not a prerequisite to interventionrecognizing that while in a diversity case a federal court may not address the plaintiffs claim unless the plaintiff has standing to sue under state law the plaintiff must also meet article iii standing requirementsholding that bjecause plaintiff does not allege that it was directly injured by the defendants alleged misconduct it lacks article iii standing to sue on its clients behalfholding that the tcpa does not limit its protection to instances in which the plaintiff is charged within the context of article iii standingholding that article iii standing is necessary for intervention & \n\nthis element.by showing either (1) the defendant \u201cis enabled to commit the predicate offenses solely by virtue of his position in the enterprise or involvement in or control over the affairs of the enterprise\u201d or (2) \u201cthe.predicate offenses are related to the activities of that enterprise.\u201d App. at 4689-90, see United States v.

The government does not have to show that the defendant\u2019s motive in committing the predicate act was to further the affairs of the enterprise. In fact, a defendant can commit a predicate act that is detrimental to the enterprise so long as the evidence establishes the requisite nexus between the predicate act and the enterprise.

Pross, 303 S.E.2d at 890. The United States Supreme Court has also employed a similar rule of statutory construction when interpreting whether the United States is included as a \u201cperson\u201d within federal legislation: Since, in common usage, the term \u201cperson\u201d does not include the sovereign, statutes employing the phrase are ordinarily construed to exclude it. But there is no hard and fast rule of exclusion. The purpose, the subject matter, the context, the legislative history, and the executive interpretation of the statute are aids to construction which may indicate an intent, by the use of the term, to bring state or nation within the scope of the law. United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604-05, 61 S.Ct. 742, 743-44, 85 L.Ed. 1071 (1941) (<HOLDING>).

Thompson, 710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983))); McRae v. United States, 420 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nto the issues presented in the original federal litigation. Upon careful review of the complaints submitted in the Saunders cases with the original Canady I complaint, we find no perceivable difference in the issues presented. Each petition alleges that appellants, as a class, identified by the same definition, were harmed by the same redlining practices employed by the homeowners\u2019 insurance industry. Appellants may not file what is essentially the same action, albeit under different legal theories, in state court merely to obtain a more favorable result than the one already obtained in their first choice of forum. See Kansas Pub. Employees Ret. Sys. v. Reimer & Roger Assocs., Inc., 77 F.3d 1063, 1070 (8th Cir.) (reasoning that a federal injunction 1326, 1334 (11th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). As stated above, this case was brought holding that an appellate court may not consider an issue not presented to the trial judge on appeal from final judgment on the meritsholding that although a district courts standing determination conclusively resolves a disputed question and settles an important issue separate from the merits of the case courts have recognized that the issue of standing is not effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgmentholding that lack of a separate judgment does not preclude the taking of an appeal from a district courts final decision because the parties may waive the separate judgment requirement where one has accidentally not been enteredholding the issue of standing is waived if not asserted at the district court levelholding individual standing issue waived & \n\nto the First Complaint except for some minor additional language added to Count II. Majority Opinion \u00b6 3. The modified claims were fully addressed by Judge Robinson and I agree with his analysis and the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Complaint under Rule 1-012(B)(6). The minor wording modification made to Count II did not establish an issue of fact regarding whether Plaintiffs\u2019 individual loan under Count II was preempted under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. Plaintiffs have failed to provide this Court with any authority to support their position that a personal loan impacting their business relationships and commercial credit avoids preemption under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. See Jojola v. Fresenius Med. Clinic, 2010-NMCA-101, \u00b6 7, 149 N.M. 51, 243 P.3d 755 (<HOLDING>). As a result, the rewording of Count II was recognizing that where a party fails to provide any authority for an argument we will presume that none existsholding that an issue is waived when a party fails to provide adequate citation to authorityholding that when a district court fails to provide reasons for imposing special conditions and the defendant fails to object we review for plain errorholding that a party waives an argument if the party fails to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support of the argumentholding when a party fails to provide arguments or supporting authority for his assertion the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\n496, 745 P.2d 717, 721 (Ct.App. 1987). In this case, Plaintiff filed a pretrial motion to exclude the assailant from being considered a concurrent tortfeasor. The motion cited Lujan v. Healthsouth Rehabilitation Gorp., 120 N.M. 422, 902 P.2d 1025 (1995), the same authority Plaintiff relies on in this appeal. Plaintiff thus fairly invoked a ruling of the trial court on this issue and preserved it for appeal. See id. (explaining liabilities of concurrent and successive tortfeasors). {36} We are unpersuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to preserve this issue by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on comparative negligence. In so contending, Defendants rely on Pittard v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 101 N.M. 723, 729, 688 P.2d 333, 339 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>), and Romero v. Mervyn\u2019s, 109 N.M. 249, 253 n. holding that a party waived an allegation that an instruction was erroneous where the party failed to object at trial to the instruction on those groundsholding that party waived an objection to choice of lawholding defendant waived complaintholding that party waived public policy challenge by failing to raise it during arbitrationholding that party waived complaint regarding instruction where it did not raise specific objection & \n\nwould have a realistic opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice, albeit by a small margin. Furthermore, it is appropriate for a district court to consider the substantial increase in turnout of black voters that usually follows the creation of an opportunity district in its effectiveness analysis. See United States v. Euclid City Sch. Bd., 632 F.Supp.2d 740, 765 (N.D. Ohio 2009) (\"[I]t is unreasonable to assume that minority turnout will not increase under a system in which that turnout is made meaningful, relative to a system in which that turnout was entirely ineffective.\u201d) With the boost in turnout of black voters the district becomes substantially more effective. 188 . Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 132 L.Ed.2d 762 (1995). 189 . Clark, 88 F.3d at 1406-07 (<HOLDING>): Davis v.

Because the court already determined that the arbitrator must decide whether this matter may proceed on a class or collective basis (doc. 62 at 8), defendants contend that the court also must hold that it is the arbitrator who must decide whether the effective vindication exception applies to invalidate the arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs never respond to this argument in their Reply. Doc. 68. Arguably, their failure to do so amounts to a waiver of this issue. See In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015, 1100-01 (10th Cir. 2014) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument because their reply brief was silent on an issue and made no attempt to rebut the respondents\u2019 argument); see also Cayetano-Castillo v. Lynch, 630 Fed.Appx. 788, 794 (10th Cir. 2015) (<HOLDING>) (quoting Hardy v. City Optical, Inc., 39 F.3d holding that an appellant who does not respond to an argument in its reply brief waives as a practical matter anyway any objections not obvious to the court to specific points urged by the appellee because the court is not required to do his work for him and dissect the appellees plausible argumentholding that if an appellee raises an argument not addressed by the appellant in its opening brief the appellant may reply citation omittedholding that a reviewing court must address an appellees reply as to preservation of error and an alternative argument in an appellees replyholding a party waives an argument made for the first time on replyholding that an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief is waived & \n\nevidence, Jacob moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that no evidence had been presented which would support a finding that his injuries were caused by anything other than Amtrak\u2019s negligence. The District Court reserved decision. Because Jacob failed to renew his motion within ten days of the entry of final judgment, as is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b); Williams v. Guzzardi, 875 F.2d 46, 50 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989). In his reply brief, Jacob argues that even if he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law, we should nonetheless review his sufficiency of the evidence argument and, if we find that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, grant a new trial. Id. (<HOLDING>). But cf. Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d holding that even when a defendant moves under rule 50 at the close of plaintiffs evidence and autocentro did not even do that if a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the posttrial stage with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidenceholding that defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law which was denied by the district court when they made it at the close of the evidence limited the relief the appellate court could grant to a new trialholding in a capital case that the defendant waived his argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue where the trial court took the motion under advisement but the defendant failed to seek a ruling on the motion and failed to renew the motion after the jurors had been qualifiedholding that the defendants insufficientevidence claim was barred by his failure to renew his rule 29 motion at the close of all the evidence because there was no manifest miscarriage of justiceholding that an appellate court should not undertake to review whether a plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when the only motion filed and the only motion on appeal was the trial courts grant of summary judgment & \n\ndistrict court, the USPS relies more heavily on a different argument: that the Award is improper because it requires the discharge of an employee who was not a party to the arbitration proceeding. But this argument also was not raised in arbitration and thus is also waived. The USPS urges that this argument is not waivable because it is based on due process and the civil service statutes; thus, if upheld, this argument would render the CBA and the Joint Statement unenforceable on public policy grounds. Our precedent does not support this position, however. See Dist. 17, 179 F.3d at 140 (finding waiver of First Amendment claim not raised during arbitration); see also AAOT Foreign Econ. Ass\u2019n (VO) Technostroyexport v. Int\u2019l Dev. & Trade Servs., Inc., 139 F.3d 980, 981-82 (2d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). We therefore hold that the decision of the holding that party waived public policy challenge by failing to raise it during arbitrationholding that the defendant waived an argument by failing to raise it in his appellants briefholding that appellant waived issue by failing to raise it in opening briefholding that party waived argument by failing to brief it on appealholding that a party abandoned an issue by failing to raise it in the opening brief & \n\nfor access services they admitted to ordering and receiving. Plaintiffs now argue that the court erred in finding that \u201cnone of defendants subscribed to plaintiffs\u2019 switched access services by submitting an Access Order as prescribed in the tariffs\u201d and in failing to consider issues of material fact that may establish that TNCI, Global Crossing, and Sprint are liable under the constructive ordering doctrine. The court will consider plaintiffs\u2019 second contention first. STANDARD The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not mention motions to reconsider. The Eighth Circuit has instructed courts to consider such motions either under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b). Sanders v. Clemco Indus., 862 F.2d 161, 168 (8th Cir.1988); see also Schoffstall v. Henderson, 223 F.3d 818, 827 (8th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Broadway v. Norris, 193 F.3d 987, 989 (8th holding that an argument raised for the first time in a rule 59e motion is waived on appealrecognizing that rule 59e permits a district court to reconsider and amend a previous orderholding that a motion to reconsider a section 2255 ruling is available and that it is to be treated asa rule 59e motion if filed within 10 days of entry of the challenged orderholding that the district court cannot extend the time for filing a rule 59e motion by margin orderholding that rule 59e applies to a motion to reconsider & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\nto the district court at sentencing that he did not have the Montgomerys' books and records either. 8 . The $137,990 figure factored in solely Montgomery\u2019s Contracting\u2019s cost of goods sold. The $68,995 figure factored in both the cost of goods sold and the Montgomerys\u2019 purportedly deductible charitable contributions. At sentencing, Mr. Montgomery's counsel conceded that accounting for the contributions was \"problematic\u201d and therefore focused the district court's attention on the $137,990 figure. Because the Montgomerys failed to brief whether the district court should have accounted for any deductible charitable contributions that the Montgomeiys could have claimed, they have waived this issue. See Rodriguez v. ConAgra Grocery Prods. Co., 436 F.3d 468, 474 n. 21 (5th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). 9 . Compare United States v. Hoskins, 654 holding that party waived argument by failing to brief it on appealholding that the defendant waived an argument by failing to raise it in his appellants briefholding that the defendant waived argument on appeal by failing to develop a cogent argumentholding party failing to adequately brief complaint waived issue on appealholding that appellant waived argument by failing to raise argument before workers compensation board and failing to list or brief issue in administrative appeal to superior court & \n\nN.J.S.A. 56:8-19. We find that Gonzalez\u2019 status as a signatory to the agreements to cure default entered with Wilshire provides her with standing under the CFA. In the circumstances presented, Wilshire\u2019s arguments regarding the lack of privity between Gonzalez and Wilshire arising from the making of the initial loan and the issue of her status as a \u201cconsumer\u201d of that loan are irrelevant. A separate contractual relationship between Gonzalez and Wilshire exists that involves the loan, but does not arise directly from it. Further, we find that the monetary damages that Gonzalez claims to exist as the result of Wilshire\u2019s allegedly unconscionable practices, if proven, constitute the statutorily-required \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d Weinberg v. Sprint, Corp., 173 N.J. 233, 237, 801 A.2d 281 (2002) (<HOLDING>). We disagree with the motion judge\u2019s holding that a deposition is the time for the plaintiff to make a record capable of surviving summary judgment not a later filed affidavitholding that district court should not have granted summary judgment solely on basis that a motion for summary judgment was not opposedholding a ruling on a motion for summary judgment adjudicating the rights of a party is a final judgment subject to appealholding that to have standing under the cfa a private party must plead a claim of ascertainable loss that is capable of surviving a motion for summary judgmentholding that district court should not have granted summary judgment solely on basis that motion for summary judgment was not opposed & \n\nchallenge, we consider and weigh all the evidence, both supporting and contradicting the finding. Mar. Overseas Corp. v. Ellis, 971 S.W.2d 402, 406-07 (Tex.1998). We set aside the fact finding only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust. Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex.1986). Initially, we note that the jury was asked to determine Grace\u2019s damages for the breach of contract the court had found. The question was worded as follows: What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, w pp.Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.)

Appellants\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 Retaliation Claims The district court granted summary judgment on appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims for two reasons: 1) appellants failed to state a plausible claim for relief as to retaliation in their Third Amended Complaint; and 2) appellants failed to advance competent summary judgment evidence demonstrating they had engaged in protected activity. Appellants\u2019 address the merits of this claim only in their reply brief. Accordingly, any claimed error as to the grant of summary judgment on appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims has been waived. See Tharling v. City of Port Lavaca, 329 F.3d 422, 430 (5th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). 3. Appellants\u2019 Hostile Work Environment and holding that the defendant waived an argument by failing to raise it in his appellants briefholding argument waived for failure to raise it in opening briefholding that appellant waived issue by failing to raise it in opening briefholding that a party abandoned an issue by failing to raise it in the opening briefholding that the failure to raise an issue in the opening brief waives the issue & \n\ncounters that the Country Club was not a party, and if it was, it was no more than an affiliated successor-in-interest or surrogate of Catalina and had no independent right to excuse the district judge. We resolve the issue in favor of the City though on different grounds. {94} The right of peremptory excusal under Rule 1-088.1 is party specific. That is, each party has a separate right of excusal which cannot be affected by the actions of other parties in a case. Thus, in JMB Retail Props., Co. v. Eastburn, 114 N.M. 115, 118, 835 P.2d 831, 834 (1992) our Supreme Court clarified that only that party who requests a discretionary act of the judge will thereafter be precluded from later exercising a peremptory challenge. Saavedra v. Thomson, 114 N.M. 718, 719, 845 P.2d 812, 813 (1992) (<HOLDING>). {95} Here, the right of peremptory challenge holding improper counsels argument that opposing counsel knew why plaintiff delayed in bringing action where opposing counsels knowledge was not in evidenceholding that hearsay evidence is not acceptable in opposing a summary judgment motionholding that laches is an affirmative defenseholding that not opposing a motion is not an affirmative act requesting discretionary actionholding that fair use is an affirmative defense & \n\n189 Colo. 173, 538 P.2d 110 (1975), and White Cap Mining Co. v. Resurrection Mining Co., 115 Colo. 396, 174 P.2d 727 (1946), for the proposition that a party should not have to search property titles before resorting to service by publication is misplaced. Both cases involve a county treasurer's obligation to ascertain the current addresses of delinquent property taxpayers before issuing tax deeds. Under section 39-11-128, C.R.S$.2015, a county treasurer must make \"diligent inquiry\" into information available in county records. Neither Siddoway nor White Cap Mining Co. say that a treasurer has no duty to search county records; they merely state that a treasurer need not search beyond county records to ascertain taxpayers' addresses. See Siddoway, 189 Colo. at 176, 538 P.2d at 113 (<HOLDING>); White Cap Mining Co., 115 Colo. at 408, 174 holding that this court need not address the merits of an argument raised for the first time on appealholding appellate court need not address issues unnecessary to its decisionholding that an administrator need not address each piece of evidenceholding that a treasurer need not search miscellaneous personal correspondence after an address had been found in the countys recordsholding that where a party does not adequately brief an argument we need not address it on appeal & \n\nbetween Long Creek, Little River, Limehouse, and Lake Wylie, the Court can attest that the factual premise of Rickborn\u2019s argument is an understatement. Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 25, 2014) (stating the rule applies \u201c \u2018if doubt exists as to the extent or fact of coverage\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buddin v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967)) (emphasis added)). As this Court has explained, exclusion A.7 is not ambiguous on the issue of whether a pickup is a private passenger auto. Cf. Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\nfailed to pay Wall\u2019s commissions or did so in bad faith in order to receive treble damages. We disagree and find that the trial court\u2019s interpretation was not an abuse of discretion. South Carolina case law does not support Fruehaufs position. Fruehauf cites to a number of cases which discuss puni tive damages in general, but not treble damages under \u00a7 41-10-80(0). See, e.g., Carter v. R.C. Jordan Oil Co., 301 S.C. 84, 390 S.E.2d 367, 368 (S.C.Ct.App.1990). Although South Carolina law requires that there be no good faith dispute concerning the wages due in order for treble damages to be awarded under \u00a7 41-10-80(0, the decision is in the complete discretion of the trial court and no specific finding of bad faith or willfulness is required.

McAllister Towing of Georgetown, holding that the tcpas treble damages provision is remedialholding that when a trial court determines that the amount of damages awarded by a jury is excessive the court may either suggest remittitur or grant a new trial on the issue of damagesholding that threequarter guarantee payments were not wages under arizona wage payment laws permitting treble damages for nonpayment under rationale that wages are restricted to compensation due an employee in return for work performedholding that the treble damages provision is not mandatory and will not apply if the trial court determines that a good faith dispute over the wages allegedly due existsholding that the award of treble damages while a matter of discretion for the trial court is inappropriate in circumstances where there is a bona fide wage dispute & \n\n"}

One of the primary functions of a L.Ed.2d 201 (1992). Thus, we hold that Gardetto\u2019s endorsement of the three insurgent candidates for the college\u2019s board positions involves speech on a matter of public concern. Similarly, we hold that Gardetto\u2019s statements criticizing Mason for holding himself out as a \u201cdoctor\u201d when he did not have a Ph.D. or other doctoral degree involves speech on a matter of public concern. The integrity, qualifications, and misrepresentations of a highly visible public official, such as the president of a college, obviously impact the social and political life of a commu nity. See Patrick v. Miller, 953 F.2d 1240, 1246-47 (10th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); Conaway, 853 F.2d at 796-97 (holding that a holding that a city finance directors allegations of discriminatory employment practices in support of black females and perceived illegal budgeting activities were matters of public concernholding that statements made only to supervisor and chief by police officer were matters of public concernholding that issues of prison security public safety and official corruption are matters of public concernholding allegations of wrongdoing by public officials are on the highest order of first amendment concernrecognizing a public employees first amendment right to address matters of legitimate public concern & \n\nin judicial speculation.\u201d Gustafson, 290 F.3d at 909. The court is to examine the record for evidence of potential or actual disruption, but not engage in excessive Monday morning quarterbacking of a police official\u2019s determination that potential disruption was present. See id. at 909-12; Kokkinis, 185 F.3d at 845-46. Here, the record demonstrates that Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks perceived potential disruption from McGreal\u2019s conduct. In light of the need for structure, loyalty, and harmony in a police department, that potential disruption is sufficient to tip the Pickering scale in favor of Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks. Having found that Chief Wood and Lt. Snooks have carried their burden under the Pickering test, they are entitled to qualified immunity. See e.g. Gragg, 289 F.3d at 965-66 (<HOLDING>). Typically, this would end the analysis, but holding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity where the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that speech was public concernholding that the absence of a motivating desire to address a matter of public concern was not dispositive as to whether the speech addressed a matter of public concernholding that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunityholding that defendants claiming qualified immunity to 1983 action were entitled to summary judgment where factual disputes were not materialholding that defendant is entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiff failed to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right & \n\norganization differs from its for-profit cousins in its treatment of net earnings does not prevent its buildings or property from being used in interstate commerce or in an activity affecting interstate commerce. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[n]othing intrinsic to the nature of nonprofit entities prevents them from engaging in interstate commerce,\u201d particularly because \u201cthey purchase goods and services in competitive markets, offer their facilities to a variety of patrons, and derive revenues from a variety of sources, nt institutions in particular, can serve in both a sovereign\/regulatory capacity and a market capacity, and their actions as either can affect interstate commerce.

Thus, the discrimination provision of the Act is not vague. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the harassment provision of the Act, \u00a7 709.338(6), is vague because the Act does not define \u201cunnecessarily harassing.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that patients may hold diverse views as to what constitutes unnecessary harassment. Plaintiffs argue that what conduct is prohibited thus depends on what a particular patient understands it to be, and that the resulting uncertainty as to what the Act prohibits \u201cis not permissible under the First Amendment.\u201d See Conant, 309 F.3d at 639 (<HOLDING>) (citing Collins, 323 U.S. at 535, 65 S.Ct. at holding that where the first amendment does not protect a certain activity there can be no first amendment right of association to engage in that activityholding a statute providing for administrative action against physicians who engage in speech that the patient believes to be a recommendation of marijuana lacks the requisite narrow specificity under the first amendmentholding statute criminalizing speech intended to influence a juror did not violate the first amendmentholding that first amendment protections apply to compelled speech as well as restrictions on speechholding that possession of marijuana is not protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment & \n\nNoerr-Pennington Doctrine. Alternatively, Markwell claims that his alleged action is immunized based on the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See Def. Mot. to Dismiss (d\/e 14) at 15. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine provides that \u201cparties may petition the government for official action favorable to their interests without fear of suit, even if the results of the petition, if granted, might harm the interests of others.\u201d See Tarpley v. Keistler, 188 F.3d 788, 794 (7th Cir.1999). The doctrine protects \u201clitigation, lobbying, and speech... as an application of the First Amendment\u2019s speech and petitioning clauses.\u201d New West, LP v. Joliet, 491 F.3d 717, 722 (7th Cir.2007). The Seventh Circuit has extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to government officials as well. See id. at 721-22 (7th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). In doing so, the court recognized that public recognizing criticisms of public officials is at core of speech protected by first amendmentholding that ijnjuries caused by the condition of a public entitys property clearly refers to ownership of a property interest which allows a public entity to control the propertyholding that joliet public officials actions of filing litigation sending letters and making public statements regarding a property in an effort to persuade the department of housing and urban development to cut funding to the property were protected by the first amendmentholding that alleged misconduct by public officials particularly by law enforcement officials is matter of public concernholding that a public entitys property refers to the public entity that owns the property where a dangerous condition exists & \n\nexecute their duties as police officers. Thus, this type of communication falls squarely within the scope of speech as a public employee under Garcetti. Moreover, the fact that plaintiff also copied the Memorandum to next level of supervision (i.e., the Village Board) does not alter the analysis in this case. The fact that plaintiff not only expressed the grievance to his immediate supervisor, but also to the entity ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the police department is simply further evidence that this speech was not citizen speech; rather, the Memorandum \u2014 whether required or not\u2014 was clearly pursuant to his duties as a police officer. See, e.g., White v. Sch. Bd. of Hillsborough Cnty., No. 8:06-CV-1626-T27MAP, 2008 WL 227990, at *5 (M.D.Fla. Jan. 25, 2008) (<HOLDING>); see also Knight v.

For instance, a state law placing conditions on public access to arrestees\u2019 home addresses is not subject to a facial challenge on free speech grounds because the government is under no obligation to make those addresses public at all. Id. Here, however, CNS asserts its First Amendment right of access to judicial and other public proceedings. See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986). It is highly doubtful that \u201cCalifornia could decide not to give out [the complaints] at all without violating the First Amendment.\u201d Id. (emphasis added); cf. Rushford v. New Yorker Magazine, Inc., 846 F.2d 249, 253 (4th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>).

[\u00b6 8] \u201cComity is a principle under which the courts of one state give effect to the laws of another state ... not as a rule of law, but rather out of deference or respect.\u201d Trillium USA, Inc. v.

Lillie, 26 N.D. 512, 529, 144 N.W. 1082, 1088 (1914). A primary concern is whether the forum state\u2019s public policies will be compromised if comity is applied. Idr, Schoeberlein v. Purdue Univ., 129 Ill.2d 372, 135 Ill.Dec. 787, 544 N.E.2d 283, 288 (1989) (<HOLDING>).

It is important to examine the proffered justifications for a college\u2019s selective denial of recognition to an organization. See Healy v. James, 408 U.S. at 184-85, 92 S.Ct. at 2347-48. Mere disagreement with the group\u2019s philosophy is not an adequate ground for denial of First Amendment rights because a state college cannot \u201crestrict speech or association simply because it finds the views expressed by any group to be abhorrent.\u201d Id. at 187-88, 92 S.Ct. at 2349. \u201c \u2018[T]he freedoms of speech, press, petition and assembly guaranteed by the First Amendment must be accorded to the ideas we hate or sooner or later they will be denied to the ideas we cherish.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 188, 92 S.Ct. at 2349 (quoting Communist Party of the United Stat 737 F.2d 1317, 1333 (5th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1001, 105 S.Ct. 1860, holding that where university has opened its forum to other similar student groups its denial of recognition to homosexual student group was the sort of viewpoint based discrimination forbidden by perry and was invalid under the first amendment unless the university could support this discrimination by providing a compelling reason for its actionsholding that a university creates a public forum when it makes its facilities generally available to registered student groupsholding that communications between the university of colorados counsel and former employees of the university concerning activities during their period of employment may be protected by the attorneyclient privilege under the rationale presented in upjohn but holding that the university waived the privilege by disclosing the documentsholding that public school violated homosexual students first amendment right to speech and expression when it banned him from bringing a samesex date to the prom notwithstanding that the student and another homosexual student had previously been assaulted by other students and that the school was forced to provide additional security and escortsholding that university violated first amendment by expelling student for printing indecent newspaper despite student code prohibiting indecent conduct or speech & \n\nright to private communication, i. e., communication free from telephone taps or interceptions. But the subject matter of the conversation at issue here is far removed from that in situations where the media publicizes truly private matters. See Michaels v. Internet Entertainment Group, Inc., 5 F. Supp. 2d 823, 841-842 (CD Cal. 1998) (broadcast of videotape recording of sexual relations between famous actress and rock star not a matter of legitimate public concern); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.

Balancing of Harm and Public Interest Similarly, it is doubtful that the balancing of harm and public interest warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that even minimal interference with the First Amendment freedom of the press causes an irreparable injury. See, e.g., Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); see also Barbnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 531-32, 121 S.Ct. 1753, 149 L.Ed.2d 787 (2001) (<HOLDING>). The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that the recognizing as a privacy right the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal mattersholding that bargaining unit employees have some nontrivial privacy interest in nondisclosure of their home addresses under the freedom of information act and concluding that that interest substantially outweighed the virtually nonexistent public interest in disclosure under foia and the privacy act not the nlraholding that first amendment interest in publishing matters of public importance outweighed conversants privacy rights given fact that media outlet had played no part in illegal receptionholding that issues involving the local board of education were matters of public importancerecognizing a public employees first amendment right to address matters of legitimate public concern & \n\nintimidate[ ], or interfere[ ] ... with any person,\u201d (3) \u201cbecause that person [the victim] is ... obtaining or providing reproductive health services.\u201d Act, \u00a7 3(a). The government\u2019s first defense is that the Act does not implicate the First Amendment at all; rather, it regulates conduct that is outside the First Amendment. According to the government, the Act leaves plaintiffs free to engage in any form of protected speech they choose. In many respects the government is correct. The Access Act does not prohibit protestors from prayin S.Ct. 2538, 2546-47, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Finally, certain physical obstructions, such as a blockade of pedestrian traffic, are not protected by the First Amendment. See Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U.S. 611, 617, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 1339, 20 L.Ed.2d 182 (1968) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the Act does target unprotected holding that under 521 the coercive force applied against a plaintiff must result in an interference with a separate constitutional or statutory right and it is not sufficient that the right interfered with is the right to be free of the force or threat of force that was appliedholding that the plaintiffs right to political speech is fully in accord with the publics interest in free speech and associationholding that shortterm and sporadic interference with free exercise rights does not violate the first amendmentholding that to the extent compliance with the flsa interferes with the state budgetary process that interference is caused by state law not federal lawholding that a statute which prohibited unreasonable interference with access to a courthouse was a valid law and the fact that free speech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection & \n\nin Salinas was not necessary to the resolution of that case and therefore provides no binding authority. See, e.g\u201e Baumgart v. State, 512 S.W.3d 335, 342 (Tex. Crim. App. 2017) (refusing to treat statement in previous, case as binding authority because it was not necessary to the resolution of the case). We review decisions of courts of appeals on discretionary review. Tex. Const. art. V, \u00a7 5(b) (\u201c[T]he Court of Criminal Appeals may, on its own motion, review a decision of a Court of Appeals in a criminal case.\u201d); Holland v. State, 802 S.W.2d 696, 701 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (\u201cIn our discretionary review capacity we review \u2018decisions\u2019 of the court of appeals.\u201d). In Salinas, the court of appeals never considered the issue of retroactivity because it declared the court costs at 2013) (<HOLDING>). That is why I would grant review in this case holding portions of the coercion of public servant or voter statute unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the first amendment and in violation of the separation of powersholding new yorks disclosure law unconstitutionally overbroadholding portions of the online solicitation of a minor statute unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the first amendmentholding the improper photography or visual recording statute unconstitutionally overbroad in violation of the first amendmentholding that a statute must burden a substantial amount of protected speech to be unconstitutionally overbroad & \n\nAlthough public policy arguments are not resolved by juries, they require that the court understand what happened to a plaintiff, a question only answered after a. judge has heard evidence detailing the circumstances that resulted in an injury. See Lodge, 246 Conn. at 578, 717 A.2d 215 (resolving public policy question after trial); Jaworski, 241 Conn. at 408, 696 A.2d 332 (same). To address public policy for the first time at this stage in the litigation deprives the Munns of the opportunity to rebut Hotch-kiss\u2019s version of events. How, for example, could the Munns have known that they needed to offer evidence of \u201cthe normal expectations of the participants in the activity under review\u201d? Even if Hotchkiss had adequately preserved its argument, however, it should not be excused from (<HOLDING>).

See, e.g., Quinn v. Webb Wheel Products, supra; Robinson v.

While Stein\u2019s appeal letter could have been holding that a foia request should be read to seek all documents covered by a catchallholding that foia exemptions are not mandatory bars to disclosure because the purpose of foia is to provide broad disclosure of government documentsholding that a contract should be read to give reasonable meaning to all provisions of that contractholding that the agency did not have an obligation to search for and produce the documents the plaintiff claimed entitlement to because the plaintiffs foia request gave no indication that she sought those particular documentsholding that related provisions should be read together & \n\nCourt is skeptical that section 6 is properly read as broadly as the government urges. But because the matters alleged by the plaintiffs are, as we will discuss, subject to the state secrets privilege, we need not definitively determine the thorny issue of the proper scope of section 6. b. Section 102A(i)(l) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 Section 102A(i)(l) states that \u201c[t]he Director of National Intelligence shall pro tect intelligence sources and methods from disclosure.\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403-1(0(1). Plaintiffs concede this statute allows the Director of National Intelligence to withhold information covered by the statute when it is requested of him or agencies under his control. See, e.g., CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 1881, 85 L.Ed.2d 173 (1985) (<HOLDING>); Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755 holding that foia exemptions are not mandatory bars to disclosure because the purpose of foia is to provide broad disclosure of government documentsholding that precursor to 102ail could shield against foia requestholding that a foia request should be read to seek all documents covered by a catchallholding that when a plaintiff has no pending foia request with an agency and has not averred that he intends to make foia requests to the agency in the future any claim of future injury is simply too speculative and remote to give him standingholding that a response to a foia request falls within the scope of 3730e4as administrative report provision & \n\nto counsel. Of course, it could be said that Clark can hardly complain about the district court\u2019s grant of his own motion. But, because the court\u2019s discretion to deny a request for self-representation requires the court to consider the defendant\u2019s interest, I would conclude that a defendant who makes such a motion, against the advice of or without the support of his appointed counsel ke a searching inquiry of Clark\u2019s reasons for wanting to dismiss his present counsel. , On their face, Clark\u2019s claims that counsel had not visited him in jail, had not discussed the case with him, would not seek out suggested witnesses, and would not have the gun checked for fingerprints, raised serious questions that required inquiry. See, e.g., United States v. Morrissey, 461 F.2d 666, 669 (2d Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The majority suggests that Clark\u2019s claims do holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to substitute counsel on the strength of gonzalezs sworn responses at the pleataking that no one was threatening him or forcing him to plead where the defendant alleged that his attorney forced him to plead guilty and threatened him if he did not take the pleaholding even when a request for an attorney is ambiguous it is incumbent upon law enforcement to seek clarification of the ambiguity before denying the statutory right to counselholding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding that an ambiguous mention of an attorney is not a request for counselholding that a defendants claim that his attorney did not meet with him or seek out witnesses required a searching inquiry before denying the request for new counsel & \n\nbetween Long Creek, Little River, Limehouse, and Lake Wylie, the Court can attest that the factual premise of Rickborn\u2019s argument is an understatement. Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 25, 2014) (stating the rule applies \u201c \u2018if doubt exists as to the extent or fact of coverage\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buddin v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967)) (emphasis added)). As this Court has explained, exclusion A.7 is not ambiguous on the issue of whether a pickup is a private passenger auto. Cf. Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\na petition for review which challenges a removal order to limit its review to the facts in the administrative record, the court of appeals will not be in a proper position to rule on a \u201cconstitutionally based injunction on the execution of a removal order.\u201d Id. In the absence of habeas jurisdiction in the district courts, Petitioner fears that she will be deprived of an adequate and effective forum for judicial review. In such a situation, Petitioner argues, \u00a7 106 of the REAL ID Act constitutes an unlawful suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Id. In order to avoid a Suspension Clause violation, Petitioner argues that this court should interpret \u00a7 106 so that her case is not transferred to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. See St. Cyr., 533 U.S. at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (<HOLDING>) (internal quotations and citations omitted). holding that the rule of strict construction does not require the court to assign the narrowest possible interpretation to the statuteholding that if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is fairly possible we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problemsholding that when a court is asked to construe an ambiguous statute it must defer to the interpretation set out in a regulation promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute so long as the agencys interpretation is reasonableholding that we are to apply the legislative intent underlying a statute and to construe the statute in such a way as to prevent absurdityholding that the statute qualifies as an exemption 3 statute & \n\ndid not challenge the adequacy of [the] defendants' search for records in response to his FOIA requests in Counts II and III\u201d). 6 . The plaintiff also asserts that the defendant failed to provide to him his 2013 Within Grade Increase Notice. However, the plaintiff only requested the 2014 Within Grade Increase Notice in his FOIA request. See Def.\u2019s Mot., Def.\u2019s Facts 1. Furthermore, the Court is baffled by the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, given that he provided the Court with the requested 2013 Fiscal Year Acceptable Level of Competence Form, See Pl.\u2019s Compel Mot, I at 23. Accordingly, because the production of any 2013 Within Grade Increase Notice falls outside of the scope of the defendant\u2019s obligations under the FOIA, see Larson v. Dep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 869 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (<HOLDING>); see also Truitt v. Dep\u2019t of State, 897 F.2d holding that pursuant to the best evidence rule trial testimony relying on documents was inadmissible without submission of such documents or an explanation as to why the documents were unavailableholding that it was appropriate for the district court to refer to the documents attached to the motion to dismiss since the documents were referred to in the complaintholding that the agency did not have an obligation to search for and produce the documents the plaintiff claimed entitlement to because the plaintiffs foia request gave no indication that she sought those particular documentsholding an agency need not demonstrate that all responsive documents were found and that no other relevant documents could possibly existholding that a foia request should be read to seek all documents covered by a catchall & \n\n331 U.S. at 376. The Virgin Islands Supreme Court relied on two theories in concluding that Kendall\u2019s opinion was a clear and present danger to the fairness of the Ford case. Neither passes muster. According to the Virgin Islands Supreme Court, Kendall\u2019s opinion was punishable because it \u201ccalled the very integrity of [its mandamus] decision into question\u201d by \u201cblatantly accusing], without proof, the Justices ... of gross dereliction of their sworn duties and of committing illegal acts.\u201d Yet Kendall\u2019s criticism of the decision to issue mandamus \u2014 even if it unfairly impugned the Justices\u2019 motives \u2014 is simply not enough. His after-the-fact critique \u201ccould not affect [the Justices\u2019] ability to [fairly] decide\u201d how to rule on the petition for a writ of mandamus. Pennekamp, 328 U.S. at 348 (<HOLDING>). And the Virgin Islands Supreme Court\u2019s holding that criticism of judicial action already taken even though the cases were still pending on other points or might be revived by rehearings was not enough to satisfy the clearandpresentdanger standardholding the dismissed defendant was not precluded from obtaining its reasonable attorney fees under 1317201 even though the action was still pending against another defendantholding that even if the standard for waiver is clear the standard was not metholding that a remand should be limited to cases in which further action must be taken by the district court or in which the appellate court has no way open to it to affirm or reverse the district courts action under reviewholding that reinstatement is prospective even though it contemplated changing the result of an action already taken & \n\n\u2014 a variety of their people to get all the documents for \u2014 reference the fish pond together. And it took some time. I mean, he\u2019s not \u2014 he\u2019s not the only reporter that we end up having to do work for. Although MacPherson testified that the reason for the delay was that assembly of the eleven pages \u201ctook some time,\u201d she could not remember when she first asked that the documents be assembled or when she received the assembled documents. In the 108 days it took to fill the request, she only remembers making three phone calls to two people in an effort to get the request filled. \u00b6 31 Although a request for voluminous documents that are not all located in the same place might justify some delay in responding to a document request, cf. Cleaver v. Kelley, 415 F.Supp. 174, 175-76 (D.D.C.1976) (<HOLDING>), similar delays have been upheld only with holding agencies of state government are part of the state for purposes of sovereign immunityholding that foia exemptions are not mandatory bars to disclosure because the purpose of foia is to provide broad disclosure of government documentsholding that the duty of disclosure affects not only the prosecutor but the government as a whole including its investigative agenciesholding that state and local government agencies were not persons under the fcaholding that the failure of two government agencies to process a disclosure request within the time provisions of the foia was not in effect a denial of the request because those agencies were faced with an unpredictable backlog of requests that were being processed in chronological order & \n\n311 (7th Cir.1992); Patterson v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 11 F.3d 948, 950 (9th Cir.1993). Construing the ambiguity against the drafter under the applicable state law doctrine of contra proferentem, these circuits have held that the limitation does not include organically based illnesses. Phillips, 978 F.2d at 311; Patterson, 11 F.3d at 950. This court has held that \u201c[a]n insurance contract is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations that can fairly be made. When one of these interpretations results in coverage and another results in exclusion, ambiguity exists in the insurance policy.\u201d Dahl-Eimers v. Mut. of Omaha Life Ins. Co., 986 F.2d 1379, 1381 (11th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). The district court reasoned th 8 F.2d 302, 304, 310-11 (7th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>), with Brewer v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., holding that attorneys mental illness may justify equitable tollingholding that a mental illness limitation limiting the maximum payment for care of mental illness or care of nervous conditions of any type or cause is ambiguous because the plan contains no definition or explanation of the term mental illness and thus construed against the insurance company does not include physically based illnessesholding that upon applying the doctrine of contra proferentem the insureds organically based illness does not fall within the mental illness limitation as a matter of lawholding that a mental illness limitation containing the exact language at issue in this case is ambiguous because it does not specify whether a disability is to be classified as mental by looking to the cause of the disability or to its symptoms and thus construed in favor of the insured does not encompass organically based illnessesrecognizing attorneys mental illness as grounds for relief under rule 60b6 & \n\ncitations imposed upon Releo. The operative word in the statute is \u201cfor,\u201d as it signals when a licensed electrician is needed. As it is written, a licensed electrician is required to install any conduit when the purpose of such conduit is \u201cfor carrying * * * electricity[.]\u201d Section 5-6-2 (emphasis added). Clearly, the PVC conduit in this case was not to be used for the passage of air or water, but specifically for the carrying of electrical conductors and electricity. Further, we agree with the hearing justice that the petitioners\u2019 argument\u2014that the PVC conduit in question did not fall under \u00a7 5-6-2 because no wires or conductors were present within the PVC conduit itself\u2014would reduce the term conduit in the statute to \u201cmere surplusage.\u201d In re Harrison, 992 A.2d 990, 994 (R.I.2010) (<HOLDING>). The substantial record developed below holding that a phrase should be interpreted consistent with the context of the statute in which it is containedholding phrase based upon or attributable to is not ambiguous and rejecting secondary suit constructionholding that construction that neutralizes any provision of a contract should not be adopted if the contract can be construed to give effect to all provisionsholding that a statute must be construed so that no part of the statute is rendered surplusage or superfluous internal quotation marks and citation omittedholding that no construction of a statute should be adopted that would demote any significant phrase or clause to mere surplusage quoting state v clark 974 a2d 558 572 ri 2009 & \n\nwe would not consider it binding, or even persuasive, in determining whether to grant a writ for habeas corpus. \u201cSection 2254(d) requires us to give state courts\u2019 opinions a respect ful reading, and to listen carefully to their conclusions, but when the state court addresses a legal question, it is the law \u2018as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 that prevails.\u2019 \u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 387, 120 S.Ct. at 1510. We find that the analysis set forth by Johnson is much more compelling. Because the 1997 Amendments do not impose a mandatory minimum sentence, see infra, petitioner\u2019s reliance on Smith is misplaced. Likewise, Meeks does not apply to this case, because it dealt with sentencing statutes and not parole guidelines. See generally Newland, 714 N.Y.S.2d at 631-32 (<HOLDING>). We agree that it is reasonable to interpret holding that an amendment passed two years into a 10year automatic extension period was not effective until the 10year extension period expired and stating that to hold otherwise would render the extension provision meaninglessholding that extension of a federal grand jurys term was within the discretionary powers of the district courtholding that the extension of meeks by the smith court was inappropriateholding that an amendment of restrictive covenants passed during the running of an automatic 10year extension period was not effective until the end of the 10year extension periodholding that a district court may not construe an untimely notice of appeal as a motion for extension of time & \n\nDPUC\u2019s rules will deprive Berkshire of the claimed rights that it seeks to protect. While Berkshire remained an applicant, the DPUC\u2019s rules realistically threatened to harm Berkshire\u2019s rights or interests as an operator; now that Berkshire is no longer an applicant, such a threat no longer exists. Further, in spite of our specific inquiry, Berkshire has failed to show how its dissatisfaction with the requirements significantly affected its own application, or the outcome. Berkshire accepts this reasoning in respect to its \u201ctaking without compensation\u201d claim. But, it says that the \u201ccontroversy\u201d in respect to its First Amendment claims continues, and that the case is therefore\" not moot. See Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 283, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911) (<HOLDING>). We disagree. First, Berkshire points out that holding that issues as to whether declaratory relief should be granted had become moot and would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction but that under hallman the entire appeal was not moot because there still was a live controversy as to whether appellee was entitled to recover attorneys fees under the declaratory judgments act and therefore issues regarding attorneys fees were not moot and would be decidedholding that a trial court may deny a confirmation motion when satisfaction has rendered the controversy mootholding a case becomes moot when a ruling will have no practical effect upon the existing controversyholding appeal moot on this basisholding continuing controversy not moot & \n\nimmediate appeals of interlocutory orders if a statute explicitly provides such jurisdiction. See Tex. A & M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 840 (Tex.2007). We strictly construe a statute authorizing an interlocutory appeal because it is an exception to the general rule that only final judgments are appealable. Id. at 841. To appeal pursuant to section 51.014(a)(5), the appellant must be \u201can individual who is an officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision of the state.\u201d See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.014(a)(5). Rogers does not argue that he is a state employee or that he otherwise contracted with a governmental entity to perform governmental duties. See id.; see also Knowles v. City of Granbury, 953 S.W.2d 19, 24 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1997, pet. denied) (<HOLDING>). We therefore limit our inquiry to whether holding that private party can assert official immunity if it contracted with a public official to perform governmental dutiesholding that where a public official takes discretionary action that the official knows will directly benefit a financial interest that the official has concealed in violation of a state criminal law that official has deprived the public of his honest services under 1346holding that if official has violated clearly established law he is entitled to qualified immunity only if reasonable official could have believed conduct was lawfulholding police officer is a public officialholding that a state official can be held individually hable under 1983 for acts taken within the scope of his or her official duties & \n\nomitted). Accord, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 691 F.2d 1009, 1014 & n. 3 (11th Cir.1982) (\u2018Voluntary\u201d means not caused by police misconduct); United States v. Barber, 557 F.2d 628, 632 (8th Cir.1977) (evidence left in police car after illegal arrest held inadmissible because discovery of the evidence was a direct result of the unconstitutional seizure of defendant\u2019s person); United States v. Newman, 490 F.2d 993, 995 (10th Cir.1974) (drugs left behind as a result of illegal search of rear compartment of camper held inadmissible). Of course, if the abandonment is truly voluntary \u2014 i.e., not caused by police misconduct \u2014 evidence found is admissible even if there was a prior or subsequent illegal search or seizure. E.g., United States v. Pirolli, 673 F.2d 1200, 1204 (11th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

Alejandrino Manangan responds to the issue whether his petition for review should be dismissed. Manangan petitioned this court for review of a Merit Systems Protection Board decision denying his request for a deferred retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). In the initial decision, the administrative judge determined that Manangan was not entitled to a Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA) annuity because his service was pursuant to excepted temporary or indefinite appointments. See Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, 48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir.1995) (upholding OPM\u2019s interpretation that an indefinite appointment is excluded from CSRS coverage); see also Casilang v. Office of Personnel Management, 248 F.3d 1381, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Manangan argues in his response that his case holding that the appeal was properly before the court where the appellant appealed from an order amending a prior order without appealing from the prior orderholding that the revocation of executive order no 10180 in 1955 did not automatically convert indefinite excluded appointments into appointments covered by the csra because executive order no 10530 kept in place the exclusion of nonpermanent employees from coverage by the csra effected by executive order no 10180 until the civil service commission promulgated new regulations which it did in 1956holding that an order by the trial court remanding the cause to the agency to impose a sanction other than the one imposed by the agency was not a final and appealable order because it did not terminate the litigation between the parties on the meritsholding that when the executive branch defaults a district court has the authority to appoint a prosecutor for contempt proceedings in order to preserve respect for the judicial system itselfholding order granting a new trial is not a final appealable order because it does not terminate the action or any of the claims or parties in the action & \n\nin Mem\u2019l Hosp.-West Volusia, Inc. v. News-Journal Corp., 729 So. 2d 373, 379 (Fla. 1999), the Florida Supreme Court held that a lessee running a hospital on behalf of a public authority responsible for public services was a public agency under Florida law. The court agreed with the Florida district court of appeal that the totality of factors test mandated by Schwab indicated that when the government transferred the responsibilities of a public health authority to a private entity, the state\u2019s sunshine requirements should continue to apply to that entity and that, therefore, open government mandates dictated that reporters must be allowed to attend hospital meetings. Id. at 379-82; see B & S Utils., Inc. v. Baskerville-Donovan, Inc., 988 So. 2d 17, 21 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2008) (<HOLDING>); Dade Aviation Consultants v.

See id. Likewise, the hair could have attached on contact with the belt or clothesline rope that were also used to bind Susan. See id. Thus, the conclusory assertion that if the hair does not belong to Overton or the victims, it must belong to a person who committed or participated in the crime, is far too tenuous because there is no way to determine when, why, where, or how the hairs attached to the tape. This assertion is the type of speculation that this Court has found to be a basis for denying a rule 3.853 motion. See Lott, 931 So.2d at 821 (<HOLDING>); Hitchcock v. State, 866 So.2d 23, 26 holding that a defendant whose new trial motion is based on the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel may bypass rule 33s sevenday time limit only if his claim that his counsel was ineffective was based on information unavailable to the defendant at the time of trialholding a written order is required for an appeal from a convicting courts ruling on a postconviction motion for dna testingrecognizing that an order for dna testing could cause irreparable harm because the test is intrusive and any error in improperly ordering genetic testing cannot be remedied on appeal after the testing is done and the results are releasedholding that the defendant embarked on a fishing expedition for genetic material whose potential relevance is pure conjecture and that the defendant could not obtain dna testing based on the speculative allegations in his motionholding that to obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence the defendant must allege facts from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the defendant & \n\nv. Webb, 194 F.3d 1116, 1132 n. 8 (10th Cir.1999) (noting that, once an employee notifies an employer of a disability and requests reassignment, both parties should \u201cinteract in good faith to determine how to reasonably accommodate the employee\u201d). We begin by recognizing that a request for reassignment may constitute protected activity under the ADA. We have treated requests for reasonable accommodation as protected activity under the ADA. See Selenke v. Med. Imaging of Colo., 248 F.3d 1249, 1265 (10th Cir.2001); Butler v. City of Prairie Vill., 172 F.3d 736, 752 (10th Cir.1999). And a request for reassignment to a vacant position is a request for a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9)(B); see also Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1167 (10th Cir.1999) (en banc) (<HOLDING>). Hence, if Mr. Jones had a reasonable, good holding that when an employer takes steps to accommodate an employees restrictions it is not thereby conceding that the employee is disabled under the ada or that it regards the employee as disabledholding that employers must when appropriate accommodate a disabled employee by reassignment to a vacant position if employee cannot be accommodated in existing jobholding that an employer does not necessarily regard an employee as disabled simply by finding the employee to be incapable of satisfying the singular demands of a particular jobholding that the employers willingness to accommodate the employee undercut the employees claim of constructive dischargeholding that an employee whose disability is related to his ability to perform the duties of his position is not disabled under the act and therefore an employer has no duty to accommodate & \n\n499 F.Supp.2d 501, 514 (S.D.N.Y.2007) for the proposition that the privilege does not reach \"routine operating decisions.\u201d PL\u2019s Mem. for Mot. to Compel at 26, but it is the Mead Data opinion that has precedential value here. 7 . Even the cases the Committee cites indicate that the privilege covers agency deliberations about decisions, as well as the formulation of policy positions. In Taxation with Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677 (D.C.Cir.1981), the Court stated, \"the privilege protects documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated ....\u201d See also Paisley v.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that punitive damages are not available under the Act, and we emphasize that the trial court should have made clear to the jury that it could not award punitive damages based upon a violation of the Consumer Protection Act. The trial court\u2019s omission certainly leaves open the possibility that the jury wrongly awarded punitive damages in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Act rather than in connection with a common law claim for recovery. Although we cannot assume that the jury understood the relevant law, since it was not properly instructed, we decline to assume the inverse, as did the Court of Appeals, that the jury found only a violation of the .C.App. 237, 446 S.E.2d 100, 105 (1994) (<HOLDING>). Some courts merely state that the higher holding that where a plaintiff is entitled to treble damages under its state unfair trade practices act and to punitive damages under common law claims of fraud trial court should have submitted each theory of recovery to the jury and then allowed plaintiff to elect between the awards with duplicative elementsholding that even if the trial court had erred in denying the defendants motion for a directed verdict on punitive damages the error was harmless because the jury found in favor of the defendant and never reached the punitive damages claimsholding that the trial court erred by denying plaintiffs request to instruct the jury on all its claims and to submit a special verdict form and by instead requiring the plaintiff to elect between its statutory antitrust claim and its common law tort claims to be submitted to the juryholding that trial court erred by requiring plaintiff to select which remedy to submit to the jury because plaintiff was allowed to elect its remedy between punitive damages and statutory treble after the jurys verdict on all claims was renderedholding that a plaintiff is entitled to either statutory treble damages or punitive damages whichever is the greater & \n\n"}

Under the circumstances presented by the record before us, we cannot be confident that the result of Harrington\u2019s murder trial would have been the same had the exculpatory information been made available to him. We hold, therefore, that Harrington\u2019s due process right to a fair trial was violated by the State\u2019s failure to produce the police reports documenting their investigation of an alternative suspect in Schweer\u2019s murder. See Mazzan, 993 P.2d at 74-75 (finding Brady violation where withheld \u201cpolice reports provided support for [the defendant\u2019s] defense that someone else murdered\u201d the victim); Davis v.

First, Primus and Button are concerned only with the solicitation and financing of good faith claims. Here, the Plaza defendants are alleged to have solicited numerous baseless suits by the landowners. Second, the First Amendment does not shield such improper practices in the solicitation and representation of clients as occurred here. See Primus, supra, 436 U.S. at 426 and 439, 98 S.Ct. at 1901 and 1908; cf. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, 436 U.S. 447, 449, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1915, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978) (<HOLDING>).

Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nfor the \u201cprevailing competitive price\u201d for glass repair based upon \u201cprices charged by a substantial number of repair facilities in the area * \u215c * as determined by a survey.\u201d Because Glass Service\u2019s prices typically exceed what State Farm has determined by a survey to be the prevailing competitive price, State Farm is not obligated under the policy to pay the excess. State Farm was justified in informing insureds of this policy limitation and in suggesting alternative vendors whose charge would be fully covered under the policy. See Minn.Stat. \u00a7 72A.201, subd. 4(5) (making it an unfair claims practice to fail to notify an insured of all available benefits which the insured may be eligible to receive); see also DeBonaventura v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 419 A.2d 942, 951 (Del.Ch.1980) (<HOLDING>).

When, as here, a legislative classification implicates neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class, the classification is invalid only if it bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental objective.

Greer v. Spock, it should be noted, did not hold that any military base falls automatically into the \"nonforum\u201d category. Rather, Greer held simply that, based on the facts in that case, which established that the base there had not been opened generally by the military to the public for expressive or other purposes, the base commander could constitutionally place certain content-neutral restrictions on speech on the base. See Greer, 424 U.S. at 837-838, 96 S.Ct. at .1217-1218 (distinguishing Flower v. United States, 407 U.S. 197, 92 S.Ct. 1842, 32 L.Ed.2d 653 (1972) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). 3 .

Mem. at 26). Individual issues, however, would predominate even before the damages stage. Because plaintiff will not be able to prove class-wide, company-wide discrimination with statistical evidence alone, a jury would need to consider each putative class member\u2019s claim individually to determine liability. To prove that an individual plaintiff suffered gender discrimination under disparate impact or disparate treatment theories of Title VII or the Equal Pay Act, an individualized inquiry into each putative plaintiffs circumstances would be necessary to determine whether employment actions taken toward a particular employee were based on gender or instead on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. See Warren v. Solo Cup Co., 516 F.3d 627, 629-30 (7th Cir., 2008) (<HOLDING>); Atanus v. Perry, 520 F.3d 662, 672-73 (7th holding that same standard applies to equal pay act and title vii wage discrimination claimsholding that if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the equal pay act the employer may raise one of four statutory defenses attributing the difference in pay to i a seniority system ii a merit system ni a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production or iv a differential based on any other factor other than sexholding that if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of age discrimination the employer must show that the discharge was based on reasonable factors other than age and if the employer meets that burden the plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the dischargeholding that to establish a prima facie equal pay act claim the plaintiff must show that the jobs being compared are substantially equalholding that in title vii disparate treatment case in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case the plaintiff must proffer evidence among other things that she performed her job according to her employers legitimate expectations if the plaintiff establishes the prima facie case the presumption shifts the burden to the employer to produce a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for its actions & \n\nSaulpaugh whole, its failure to apply a compound rate of interest to its calculation of damages constituted an abuse of discretion. See Clarke, 960 F.2d at 1153. On remand, however, the district court may wish to deny interest for specific years if it concludes that a delay in the litigation was the result of dilatory tactics by the plaintiff. We leave this determination to the district court in the first instance. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Saulpaugh the remedy of front pay. The award of front pay is discretionary, and where as here the district court makes a specific finding that an award of back pay was sufficient to make a plaintiff whole, no abuse of discretion can be found. Cf. Barbano v. Madison County, 922 F.2d 139, 147 (2d Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). V.

(quoting United States v. Frierson, 945 F.2d 650, 658 (3d Cir.1991)). This is supported by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statements in Murphy. In explaining under what circumstances the Fifth Amendment privilege becomes self-executing, the Court stated: A State may require a probationer to appear and discuss matters that affect his probationar 13-15 (1996) (<HOLDING>); State v.

Though the time period of retroactivity is particularly long here, such a concern is in part offset by the failure of the Plaintiffs to articulate a vested right with which the New Law interferes, as well as by the specific context of trade duties. In examining the nature and circumstances of the New Law, the court notes that customs duties are to an extent unique from other government assessments in that there is no right to import, and where unfair trade remedies apply, those with goods that may be imported rarely can predict with accuracy what the duty will be. See Norwegian Nitrogen Prods. Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 318, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933) (<HOLDING>).

Furthermore, where a censured employee retains his job and does not suffer any loss of pay or rank, any alleged harm to his stature or earnings prospects is purely speculative. See Lowe, 841 F.2d at 858. Powell \u201ccannot complain that he has been made unemployable; he remains employed, and in a job that has considerable tenure rights attached to it.\u201d Hershinow v.

In an emergency situation such as existed here, however, at least a phone call explaining the circumstances was required to preserve a potential challenge to the IJ's authority to enter an in absentia order.

Courts agree that a \u201cmarket\u201d rate of interest should apply. See Koopmans, 102 F.3d at 874-75; In re Smithwick, 121 F.3d at 214; In re Valenti, 105 F.3d at 63; GMAC, 999 F.2d at 66-67; United Carolina Bank, 993 F.2d at 1129-30; In re Fowler, 903 F.2d 694, 697 (9th Cir.1990); In re Hardzog, 901 F.2d at 859-60; Arnold, 878 F.2d at 927-28; see also Pearson, supra at 40-41; Epstein, supra at 443. There is disagreement, however, about what rate of interest will adequately ensure that the creditor receives full value of his secured claim. 1. Under one approach, known as the \u201ccost of funds method,\u201d the interest rate is set at the rate the creditor would have to pay to borrow the amount equal to the collateral\u2019s value. See In re Valenti 105 F.3d at 64 (<HOLDING>); 8 Lawrence P. King et al., Collier on holding that although cost of funds approach more appropriately reflects the present value of a creditors allowed claim it is difficult to administer and therefore the interest rate should be fixed at the rate on a united states treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtors reorganization planholding that bankruptcy plan of reorganization rather than 1961 controlled the setting of the interest rateholding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that the proper rate for prejudgment interest is the rate fixed by the parties in a contract & \n\nnot under Rule 21 but Rule 42(b) and effects merely a \u201cseparation of claims in an action in which multiple parties have been joined.\u201d) (emphasis omitted). The confusion that can arise from loose talk of \u201cseverance\u201d where in fact only a separation of claims has occurred, together with the impact the distinction can have on appellate jurisdiction, occasionally has provoked judicial frustration. See Spencer, White & Prentis, Inc. v. Pfizer, 498 F.2d 358, 359 (2 d Cir.1974) (speaking of the \u201ctangle of Rules 21, 42(b) [and] 54(b)\u201d). In the context of removal to federal court in diversity jurisdiction, the mere fact that an order of a state court purports to have \u201csevered\u201d claims generally is insufficient to make a case removable. See Nolan v. Boeing Co., 919 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v. Unijax, Inc., 625 F.2d 54, 56 holding that diversitydefeating parties were not severed from a case so as to permit removal to federal court where article 1038 of the louisiana code of civil procedure pursuant to which the severance was made authorizes separate trials rather than a true severanceholding the lumpsum payment of a severance benefit to be evidence of lack of an administrative schemeholding that a plan providing severance pay for reduction in work force simply did not contemplate the effect of a sale of a business on the availability of severance payholding that severance pay policy was part of employment contractholding that death qualification of jury is not of itself grounds for severance of a noncapital defendant & \n\nreach, where it was readily accessible to him but not to the other occupants of the vehicle. In Taylor, the contraband was in carrying bags that were personal to someone other than the defendant. The lynchpin of the Court\u2019s holding there was that it is not permissible to infer that someone merely occupying a room in which there are carrying bags belonging to another person knows the contents of those personal carrying bags. In this ease, by contrast, the white bag was not personal to someone other than the appellant, to a particular occupant of the car, or to anyone. The kind of evidence that in Taylor negated any reasonable inference of knowledge and possession is not present here. The white bag was an ordinary plastic bag. See Ford v. State, 37 Md.App. 373, 381, 377 A.2d 577 (1977) (<HOLDING>). Officer Webster testified that plastic bags holding the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the juvenile a front seat passenger of a vehicle occupied by four persons was in possession of marijuana recovered from a crumpled piece of newspaper behind the drivers seatholding no unfair prejudice from admission of conviction for possession of 50 to 200 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute as evidence of intent to distribute cocaineholding that evidence was sufficient to sustain conviction of front seat passenger of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in paper bag in foot well of volkswagen on passengers side near gearshift in presence of marijuana smokeholding that the arresting officer lacked probable cause to arrest defendant a rear seat passenger of a car for possession of marijuana based on the discovery of two marijuana seeds in the front of the vehicleholding the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the defendant a front seat passenger of a vehicle occupied by three individuals was in constructive possession of marijuana found in white bag directly under the defendants seat & \n\nthe court should not have imposed an offense level of 34. He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

See ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d).

We accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court plainly erred in imposing attorney fees of $416 on this record. See State v. Coverstone, 260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (<HOLDING>). Further, we conclude that, for reasons holding that it is plain error for a trial court to require a defendant to pay courtappointed attorney fees in the absence of legally sufficient evidence that defendant has the ability to pay the amount imposedholding that a trial court commits plain error by imposing courtappointed attorney fees where the record is silent as to the defendants ability to pay the fees orderedholding that a trial court cannot decide the issue of attorneys fees without findings as to one spouses ability to pay and the others needholding because an award of attorney fees is discretionary court may consider attorney fees in relation to the underlying equities in the caseholding that trial court properly assessed mothers attorneys fees as necessaries against father in case in which trial court ordered father to pay mothers attorneys fees as child support but did not state that the fees were necessaries & \n\nplan, indicating no intention to repay any of his debtors. (Bankr.Ct. D.I. 82, at 7.) Failure to propose repayment to any of his creditors was a failure to submit a confirmable plan. Furthermore, Mr. Dye will not be given another chance in this court to submit a confirmable Chapter 13 plan. See Wolstein v. Docteroff (In re Docteroff), 133 F.3d 210, 215 (3d Cir.1997) (refusing to give \u201clitigants who abuse the processes and dignity of the court a second bite at the apple.\u201d) Even if the Dyes had provided a plan to repay some of their creditors, the plan could not have been confirmed because of a refusal to file tax returns. Accurate tax returns are important for a Bankruptcy Court to confirm a Chapter 13 plan. See Whitehead v. United States, 1997 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11458 (D.Fla.1997) (<HOLDING>).

While the Court of Criminal Appeals refers to all three of these rules in its peitinent order, we focus our analysis on Rule 32.6(b), as Frazier\u2019s failure to provide \"full disclosure of the factual basis\u201d of the relevant claim was the sine qua non of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s dismissal. 7 . It is uncontroversial that \"[i]f the petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies that are no longer available, that failure is a procedural default which will bar federal habeas relief, unless either the cause and prejudice or the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is established.\u201d Smith v.

We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\n106 S.Ct. at 1724 (quoting Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 258, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1096, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). The prosecutor having offered a race-neutral reason for the challenge, the trial court must evaluate the credibility of the parties in order to determine whether the reason articulated by the prosecutor is, indeed, legitimate and non-discriminatory, or if it is, in fact, pretextual. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that the defendant in Batson had made a timely objection to the peremptory challenge, the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that in order to preserve the Batson issue for subsequent review, a defendant must make an objection at the l exceptions to the procedural default are not applicable in a Batson claim.

In that case, we found the petitioner had failed to prove that he had exhausted all other avenues of relief because he had not filed a fee petition pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1725. Id. Although the district court below did not address whether the reasons for the ALJ\u2019s disapproval of the fee agreement were entitled to deference, this does not change Cordoba\u2019s requirement that a representative seeking approval of a fee agreement must exhaust all available administrative remedies \u2014 including a fee petition \u2014 before the writ of mandamus may be granted. See also Power, 292 F.3d at 786 (<HOLDING>). In addition, Baker has not shown that the fee recognizing conflict between filing motion to dismiss and fee application and noting postponement of fee application resulted in no prejudice to any partyholding that where a contract for legal services fails to expressly provide for the amount of the fee a reasonable fee is impliedholding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that petitioner had failed to exhaust alternative remedies for review of his fee agreement because the ssa notified petitioner he could obtain his fee by filing a fee petitionholding that the petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his claim involving a procedural error correctable by the bia & \n\n460, 463 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cEquitable tolling is proper only when extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d), petition for cert. filed, \u2014 U.S.L.W. -, \u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. June 11, 2001) (No. 00-10520). Because Hatcher filed his habeas petition over two years past the required date for a timely petition, the appeal is untimely and we are barred from reviewing it on the merits. In addition to being untimely, all of the arguments contained in Hatcher\u2019s appeal (except for the District Court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing) have been defaulted by his failure to raise them on direct appeal or in state post-conviction proceedings. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Hatcher admits that he procedurally defaulted holding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that federal courts must defer to independent and adequate state procedural bars in reviewing 2254 petitionsholding that 15a1419a3 is an independent and adequate state ground for a state courts finding of procedural defaultholding that rule 322a is an adequate and independent procedural barholding that in reviewing trial courts ruling on habeas corpus petition reviewing court must defer to all of trial courts implied factual findings supported by record & \n\ncharacterize a claim of procedural error as one of jurisdictional dimension. The fact that a trial court may have erred along the course of adjudicating a dispute does not mean it lacked jurisdiction. Thus, while we might casually say, \u201cJudge Flywheel assumed jurisdiction,\u201d or \u201cthe court had jurisdiction to impose a ten-year sentence,\u201d such statements do not have anything to do with the law of jurisdiction, either personal or subject matter. Real jurisdictional problems would be, say, a juvenile delinquency adjudication entered in a small claims court, or a judgment rendered without any service of process. Thus characterizing other sorts of procedural defects as \u201cjurisdictional\u201d misapprehends the concepts. K.S. v. State, 849 N.E.2d 538, 541-42 (Ind.2006) (emphasis in original) (<HOLDING>). In Packard v. Shoopman, our supreme court holding that the alleged failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the unsafe building act was a procedural rather than jurisdictional error and was thus waived when it was not raised in a timely fashionholding that time limit for filing petition for review is mandatory and jurisdictionalholding that petitioner could not collaterally attack his state court conviction on a petition for review of an agency decisionholding that the juvenile courts alleged failure to approve by written order the filing of a delinquency petition was a procedural error and not a jurisdictional one and thus could not be attacked collaterallyholding that the time limit for filing a petition for review of a final order of deportation is jurisdictional & \n\n1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000). Instead, Burns appears to concede his federal habe-as petition is untimely but argues application of the one-year limitations period to a person in his position raises serious constitutional questions. See Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). After reviewing the record and considering the claims Burns is attempting to raise in his \u00a7 2254 petition, we reject his argument that applying the limitations period in this case renders the habeas remedy inadequate or ineffective. See Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). Burns asserts he is illiterate and was denied counsel during a critical stage of the proceedings, resulting in his inability to ap peal his conviction. Cf. Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d 361, 376-380 (2d Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). The record contradicts these assertions. holding habeas review was available to federal prisoner claiming actual innocence who was barred from bringing a successive 2255 motion because the denial of collateral review would raise sufficiently serious constitutional questions under the eighth amendment and the due process clauseholding in a 2255 case that the failure to raise a bailey claim on direct review can be overcome by a showing of actual innocencerecognizing that after iirira habeas review remains available to raise substantial constitutional questionsholding that a prisoner cannot use the savings clause of 28 usc 2241 to escape the restrictions on successive 2255 motions and the failure to raise an available claim earlierholding that petitioner was barred from bringing apprendi claim on second or successive motion to vacate because supreme court had not made apprendi retroactive to cases on collateral review & \n\nv. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 711 F.2d 60 (6th Cir. 1983). The court in Pennington, citing to Hill, 122 B.R. 539, further explained that when a debtor counterclaims against the plaintiff in initial proceedings, the counterclaim is not stayed by section 362, because the proceeding is not \u201cagainst\u201d the debtor. Noting that all of the authority of which it was aware held that the initial proceedings, and not the appeal, constitute the reference point for determining whether the action is one \u201coriginally brought\u201d against the debtor, the court held that Harvest Foods was not entitled to a stay of its appeal because it, as the debtor, was the party who originally brought the action. See also Association of St. Croix Condominium Owners v. St. Croix Hotel Corp., 682 F.2d 446 (3d Cir. 1982) (<HOLDING>). This court\u2019s decision in Pennington is in holding that whether a case is subject to the automatic stay must be determined at its inception and such a determination does not change depending on the particular stage of litigation at which the filing of the bankruptcy petition occursholding state of the law must be determined at time of challenged actionholding that the filing of a motion for a new trial is a critical stage of the prosecution and that an indigent defendant is constitutionally entitled to the assistance of counsel at that stageholding that at this stage of the proceedings review is limited to a determination of whether the circuit court afforded due process and whether the court observed the essential requirements of lawholding that at the summary judgment stage there must be sufficient evidence on which the jury could find for the plaintiff & \n\nsuits constituted extortion under the Hobbs Act. However, Aspex\u2019s mere fear of economic loss in the face of VSP\u2019s warnings does not give rise to a claim under the Hobbs Act. \u201c[Ejxtortion requires more than fear____[t]he use of the fear must be \u2018wrongful.\u2019 \u201d Sosa v. DIRECTV, Inc., 437 F.3d 923, 939 (9th Cir.2006). The Hobbs Act does not make actionable VSP\u2019s threats of altering Aspex\u2019s network status, at least to the extent that the basis for those threats \u201cdo not rise to the level of a sham,\u201d id. at 939-40, of which there is no evidence on this record. Accordingly, VSP was entitled to use some economic pressure falling within the scope of its legal rights in order to bring Aspex to the negotiating table. See Rothman v. Vedder Park Management, 912 F.2d 315, 318 (9th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Aspex also alleges that VSP\u2019s conduct is holding that harassment threats and one beating did not constitute persecutionholding that tenants interest in a sublease terminated upon the landlords termination of the lease and affirming order that landlord entitled to receive 12 months of rent deposited by subtenant with court subsequent to termination of lease and prior to denial of petition for relief from forfeitureholding that trespasser did not have expectation of privacy in bedroom where he did not pay rent and had been asked to leaveholding lessor entitled to full months rent when rent due on first of month and lease rejected on secondholding that a landlords alleged threats that tenants who did not sign a lease would have to pay their own utility bills and be subject to future rent increases did not constitute a wrongful use of force or fear & \n\ndecision on appeal. Instead, the Court correctly remands Mrs. Reliford\u2019s claim for accrued benefits to be processed in accordance with section 5121(a). 5 . Additionally, the Board, on remand in this case, should not be confused by the Court\u2019s parenthetical reference to a remand \"for [a] determination of whether [a] claim was reasonably raised, when there was an evidentiary factual bases therefore.\u2019\u2019 Ante at 305. The Court is remanding this matter \"for adjudication of Mrs. Reliford\u2019s claim based on the file as it existed at the time of her husband\u2019s death.\u201d Id. at 304. The Court is not remand ing \u2014 and indeed cannot remand \u2014 this matter for a determination of whether a claim was reasonably raised. See Jarrell, 20 Vet.App. at 331; see also DiCarlo v. Nicholson, 20 Vet.App. 52, 56 (2006) holding that the proper procedure for a claimant to pursue a claim believed to be unadjudicated and for which there is no final decision that arguably failed to consider the claim is to pursue a resolution of the original claim eg seek issuance of a final ro decision with proper notification of appellate rights and initiate a notice of disagreementholding that a denial of a claim of qualified immunity is an appealable final decisionholding that a claim before an ro remains pending until a final decision is renderedholding issuance of administrative complaint to initiate proceedings not final agency actionholding that once a regional office decision is final a claimant may only attempt to overcome the finality of that decision in one of two ways a request for revision of the decision based on clear and unmistakable error or a claim to reopen based upon new and material evidence & \n\nUnited States, No. 13-11603 (11th Cir. June 21, 2013). II. DISCUSSION The denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate presents a mixed question of law and fact, and we review the district judge\u2019s factual conclusions for clear error and questions of law de novo. Rhode v. United States, 583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and, consequently, must be construed liberally. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). District judges must resolve all claims for relief raised in habeas proceedings, regardless of whether relief is granted or denied. Clisby, 960 F.2d at 935-36 (involving a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition filed by a state prisoner); Rhode, 583 F.3d at 1291 (<HOLDING>). When a district judge fails to address all of holding 2254 applies to administrative proceedingsholding that 60day time limit for notice of appeal in civil cases not 10day limit in criminal cases applies to 2255 proceedingsholding that exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture proceedingsholding that res judicata applies in deportation proceedingsholding clisby applies to 2255 proceedings & \n\n456 F.Supp. 355, 358 (N.D.Ga.1978) (O\u2019Kelley, J.) When the initial pleading provides at least a clue as to the plaintiffs citizenship, the burden is on the defendant to file the petition for removal within thirty days of receipt of the initial pleading. Kanter & Eisenberg v. Madison Assocs., 602 F.Supp. 798, 801 (N.D.Ill.1985); Richman v. Zimmer, Inc., 644 F.Supp. 540, 541 (S.D.Fla.1986); Kaneshiro v. North Am. Co. for Life and Health Ins., 496 F.Supp. 452, 462 (D.Haw.1980). An overwhelming majority of the courts that have considered this matter have concluded that the plaintiffs failure to allege a party\u2019s citizenship in the initial pleading does not prevent the thirty day removal period from commencing. See e.g., Stokes v. Victory Carriers, Inc., 577 F.Supp. 9, 11 (E.D.Pa.1983) (<HOLDING>) and cases cited therein. Moreover, several holding that failure to allege plaintiffs citizenship in notice of removal amounted to defect in removal procedure under former version of 28 usc 1447cholding that the failure to join all the defendants in a removal petition is not a jurisdictional defectholding that plaintiffs failure to allege citizenship of first defendant did not constitute good cause for second defendants failure to timely join in removal petitionholding that a party fraudulently joined to defeat removal need not join in a removal petition and is disregarded in determining diversity of citizenshipholding that the failure of all defendant to join in the petition for removal mandated remand to state court & \n\npretrial proceedings, Defendant was repeatedly advised of the risks he faced by choosing to proceed without counsel. Nevertheless, Defendant unequivocally maintained throughout the proceedings, orally and in writing, that he wished to represent himself. Defendant argues that certain technical errors, specifically a typographical error in the indictment and the prosecutor\u2019s initial misstatement of the maximum sentence at the arraignment, render his conviction invalid. Without a showing of prejudice, these errors do not constitute grounds for reversal. See United States v. Romero, 640 F.2d 1014, 1015 (9th Cir.1981). Defendant has not demonstrated prejudice; the technical errors were promptly corrected. See Garland v. Washington, 232 U.S. 642, 645-46, 34 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed. 772 (1914) (<HOLDING>). AFFIRMED. ** This disposition is not holding that instructional errors that are trial errors are subject to harmless error analysisholding that incorrect charges on substantive elements of a crime constitute reversible errorholding that error in denying such challenge is reversible error without demonstration of prejudiceholding that technical errors in arraignment do not constitute reversible error absent actual prejudice to the defendantholding the denial of a bill of particulars was not reversible error because it failed to cause the defendant any prejudice & \n\nconviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent remains \u2018convicted\u2019 for immigration purposes.\u201d 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624; see also Herrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299, 306 (1st Cir.2000) (\u201c[A] subsequent dismissal of charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the merits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, does not vitiate that original admission [of guilt].\u201d). Nothing in Pickering precludes a stipulated vacatur from invalidating a conviction as a ground for removal or for other immigration purposes, provided that the vacatur is still based on a defect in the underlying conviction rather than rehabilitative or otherwise proscribed grounds. See Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193 (3rd Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 1131 holding that a prior conviction obtained in violation of a defendants constitutional rights cannot be used as the underlying conviction in a prosecution under colorados felon with a gun statuteholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on himholding that the petitioners vacatur obtained by settlement rather than adjudication meets the pickering standard because the petitioner claimed a defect in his underlying convictionholding that standard of review is a matter of procedural rather than substantive lawholding that it is the conduct required to obtain a conviction rather than the consequences resulting from the crime that is relevant & \n\nvalidly claim anxiety and concern over the pending charges. But that is not enough to find a constitutional speedy trial violation. Rather, if there is no actual prejudice, the presumed prejudice flowing from a long delay is \u201cinsufficient to carry a speedy trial claim absent a strong showing on the other Barker factors.\u201d Oriedo, 498 F.3d at 600. This case does not present even a weak showing on the other Barker factors: Ashburn was as much, if not more, responsible for the pretrial delay; while Ashburn asserted his speedy trial rights, he also continued to request continuances; and the delay did not cause any pretrial incarceration and did not impair his defense. Under these circumstances, Ashburn was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. See Oriedo, 498 F.3d at 601 (<HOLDING>); Loera v. United States, 714 F.3d 1025, 1032 holding that a 19month delay between indictment and trial did not violate the constitutional right to a speedy trialholding the defendant did not demonstrate a denial of his sixth amendment right to a speedy trial where even though the delay was substantial and the defendant was detained pretrial for three years the fault for the delay was shared and the defendant continued to request continuances following his assertion for the right to a speedy trialholding that aggressiveness with which defendant asserted his speedy trial right was lacking because he merely filed one demand for speedy trial and opposed his original counsels withdrawalholding that when determining whether a delay in prosecution violates a defendants right to a speedy trial courts must consider the length of the delay the reason for the delay whether the defendant asserted his rights and the resulting prejudice to the defendantholding that whether a pretrial motion actually caused or is expected to cause delay of trial is irrelevant to the speedy trial act & \n\nof the State to bring the defendant into court to answer the charge brought against him.' \u201d) (quoting Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 30, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 2104, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974)). 13 . If the government were correct that X-Citement Video announced a new rule, this would provide an additional ground for our conclusion that the cause and prejudice requirement does not apply. We have consistently permitted defendants to challenge their convictions in \u00a7 2255 motions, where there has been an intervening change in the law after the time for direct appeal has run. See, e.g., Sood, 969 F.2d at 775 (defendants pled guilty and did not challenge their convictions until post-conviction collateral proceedings); see also Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 16, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 2910, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (<HOLDING>). 14 .The district court shall enter an order holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim alleged to be cause for the procedural default of other claims is itself an independent claim subject to the procedural requirements of exhaustionholding that the novelty of a petitioners claim can constitute cause for a procedural defaultholding prosecutorial misconduct claim barred by procedural defaultholding that a federal court may excuse a state habeas petitioners procedural default if the petitioner can show cause for the failure to raise the claim and prejudice resulting from such failureholding judicial recusal claim barred because of procedural default & \n\nto consider evidence of Clemons\u2019s IQ when sentencing him to death. Counsel stated that the Supreme Court of the United States' holdings in Tennard and Smith require the circuit court to investigate and find as mitigating any evidence indicating that a capital defendant has a low IQ. Clemons did not raise this claim in the circuit court. In his Rule 32 petition, he asserted only that the \"jury did not hear and was therefore unable to consider and give effect to his mitigating evidence of low intelligence and mental retardation.\" (C. 20.) Because Clemons\u2019s allegation that the circuit court was required to find and consider mitigating evidence relating to his IQ was not raised in his Rule 32 petition, that claim is not properly before this Court. See Ex parte Clemons, 55 So.3d at 351 (<HOLDING>); Ex parte Linnell, 484 So.2d 455, 457 holding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raised in the rule 32 petitionholding that because the petitioner had already filed a rule 371 petition he was barred from submitting a subsequent petition under that rule and his petition was subject to dismissal on that basis regardless of the label he placed on itholding that where the petitioner alleges that he failed to receive notice of the dismissal of his rule 32 ala rcrim p petition in time to effect a timely appeal therefrom and the events about which the petitioner complains all occurred before june 1 2005 the effective date of the amendment to rule 32 providing a different remedy for obtaining an outoftime appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition a petition for a writ of mandamus is the only appropriate remedyholding that a similar claim in a rule 32 petition was procedurally barred because it was raised at trial and because it was raised on direct appealrecognizing that rule 32 is a postconviction remedy & \n\nof paternity against a man other than the one signing the paternity acknowledgment. Such distinction is of critical importance to the analysis of the applicability of principles of res judicata since the preclu-sive effect of res judicata attaches only to parties to the original action. In Michael George, once the action was initiated Wyatt, 475 So.2d 1332, 1334 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985) (finding that child not party to first action not barred by res judicata because child and mother are not in privity due to divergent interests); In re M.D.H., 437 N.E.2d 119, 130 (Ind.Ct.App. 1982) (finding res judicata inapplicable to child support petition of child because earlier action was not filed by or in the name of the child); Baker by Williams v. Williams, 503 So.2d 249, 254-55 (Miss.1987) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the difference in result between the holding that the trial judge had the power to incorporate a settlement agreement in a decree following the entry of a decree of divorceholding that adjudication of paternity in divorce decree is not binding on the childrecognizing a divorce decree which incorporates a property settlement agreement is a final and conclusive adjudication holding that an adjudication on summary judgment is an adjudication on the meritsholding that a paternity determination in which the child is not made a party and is not represented by a guardian ad litem is not binding on the child & \n\nwithout their permission. Bums Librarian O'Neill states in his affidavit that \"[h]ad the assurances of confidentiality not been made, it is doubtful that any paramilitary would have participated in this oral history project. Their stories would have died with them, and an opportunity to document and preserve a critical part of the historical record would have been lost forever.\u201d 27 . Appellants\u2019 intervention complaint raised the same claims as their separate civil complaint. We have affirmed that there is no cause of action under the treaty and under the Constitution, so there is no need for us to consider whether the district court acted within its discretion in denying appellants' motion to intervene. Cf. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 708 F.2d 1571, 1575 (11th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). 28 .

Generally, the negligent conduct of a physician causes at least some immediate damage to the patient, but the statute of limitations, nonetheless, commences running at termination of the course of treatment, sometime after the initial damage occurs. See Schmit, 183 Minn, at 359, 236 N.W. at 625 (adopting the termination of treatment rule despite the general rule that a statute of limitations action in tort begins to run at the time of the negligent act which coincides with the injury). Zagaros claims the termination of treatment rule is inapplicable in her case because no immediate damage coincided with Erickson\u2019s allegedly negligent misdiagnosis. See Peterson v. St. Cloud Hosp., 460 N.W.2d 635, 639 (Minn.App.1990) (<HOLDING>).

After the jury verdict, Ms. Liles settled with Dr. Gordon and Ridge Pathology and voluntarily dismissed her claims against Dr. Gordon and Ridge Pathology with prejudice. The trial court entered a final judgment against the Hospital and in favor of Ms. Liles for $500,000 in compensatory damages and for $1,000,000 in punitive damages. The Hospital now appeals. II. Analysis A. Medical malpractice The Hospital first argues that the trial court erred in failing to treat this case as a medical malpractice case subject to the provisions of chapter 766. We disagree. Section 766.106(l)(a), Florida Statutes (2004), defines a \u201c[cjlaim for medical negligence\u201d or \u201cclaim for medical malpractice\u201d as \u201ca claim, arising out of 712 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, Ms. Liles, who was not a holding at least under the facts of the case that the statute of limitations in a medical malpractice action did not begin to run until the plaintiff secured a specific medical diagnosisholding that parents claims of outrage and negligent handling of a body were not subject to the medical malpractice statutes because hospital personnel did not engage in any medical skill or judgment in the disposition of the childs remainsholding that plaintiffs claim that medical providers did not comply with baker act was not subject to medical malpractice statutes ajlthough a medical diagnosis is necessary in order to involuntarily commit a patient the process of complying with the statute does not require medical skill or judgmentholding that there was insufficient evidence that alleged victim made statements to forensic nurseexaminer for purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment in part because there was no evidence regarding alleged victims past experience with medical facilities or medical providersrecognizing that even when a prisoner files suit under section 1983 alleging medical malpractice against prison medical officials medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner & \n\nshield to justice.\u201d We find no authority on which to do so and Plaintiff provides us with none. {33} This Court previously indicated, although not specifically addressing an argument concerning conflicting public policies created by the Legislature, that negligence arising out of the violation of a statutory duty does not change the immunity granted under the Tort Claims Act. See Rubio v. Carlsbad Mun. Sch. Dist., 106 N.M. 446, 449, 744 P.2d 919, 922 (Ct.App.1987) (denying education malpractice claim based on duties under the Certified School Personnel Act, stating the claim was \u201ca form of negligence and the courts of this state would have no jurisdiction over the claim unless there was a waiver of immunity\u201d); Begay v.

In Borger v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, the Nevada Supreme Court, albeit in dicta, concluded \u201cNRS 41A.071 clearly mandates dismissal, without leave to amend, for complete failure to attach an affidavit to the complaint. This interpretation is consistent with the underlying purpose of the measure, which is to ensure that such actions be brought in good faith based upon competent expert opinion.\u201d 120 Nev. 1021, 1029, 102 P.3d 600, 606 (2004) (emphasis added); accord Collins v.

County of Washoe, 122 Nev. 1298, 1303-04, 148 P.3d 790, 793-94 (2006) (<HOLDING>); Fierle v. Perez, 125 Nev. 728, 219 P.3d 906, recognizing that even when a prisoner files suit under section 1983 alleging medical malpractice against prison medical officials medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisonerholding a medical malpractice complaint filed without a supporting medical expert affidavit is void ab initio and as a consequence it does not legally exist and thus it cannot be amended under rule 15a of the nevada rules of civil procedureholding that a north carolina rule requiring an expert certification in a medical malpractice case applied in a federal tort claims act case sounding in medical malpractice brought in federal courtrecognizing that a plaintiff must produce a medical expert to testify as to causation in all but the most selfevident medical malpractice actionsholding that the ada does not create a remedy for medical malpractice & \n\nis controlling. 6 As noted above, knowledge of the \"facts\" comprising a cause of action for attorney malpractice is to be distinguished from knowledge that such conduct constitutes malpractice. As noted in Gevaart, the discovery rule does not require that the plaintiff know of the negligent character of the conduct alleged as the cause of his or her injury. See Gevaart, 111 Wn.2d at 502. 7 We note that a limited number of jurisdictions have adopted the position that a judgment of a trial court does not become final and, hence, a party to such action does not incur any injury as a result of negligent representation at such proceeding, until a court of appeals affirms the decision of the trial court and\/or the time to appeal has expired. See Neylan v. Moser, 400 N.W.2d 538 (Iowa 1987) (<HOLDING>). Such an approach may be appropriate where the holding that interest does not begin to accrue until the date of judgment not the date of verdictholding that the date of sale for an installment contract was the date of contract formation not the date of the last payment dueholding that the date of discrimination is the date on which a decision not to hire a plaintiff becomes effectiveholding that the date of injury for purposes of attorney malpractice does not occur until the last possible date when the attorneys negligence becomes irreversibleholding that the date of the federal indictment not the date of the state arrest was the triggering date for the speedytrial act & \n\nfinancial interest in AeroMed. First, the order does not in any form prohibit the offering of evidence; it prohibits certain claims. Second, the language clearly permits claims of medical malpractice and lack of informed consent, which are the issues in the instant case. Next, the order only prohibits the assertion of claims that have as an essential element a financial relationship between the physician and AeroMed. However, this case is a medical malpractice and lack of informed consent action that does not require proof of a financial interest as an essential element. See Rauch v. Mike-Mayer, 783 A.2d 815, 824 (Pa.Super.2001) (stating the essential elements required to prove medical malpractice); and see Bey v. Sacks, 789 A.2d 232, 2001 WL 1602971 (Pa.Super. December 14, 2001) (<HOLDING>). \u00b6 23 As stated above, questions referring to holding that a patient who endures an operation without his consent may base his action on a tortious batteryholding that battery is an inherently included offense of aggravated batteryholding that an operation without the patients consent sounds in batteryholding that battery is clearly a factual determination readily resolved by the application of a legal standard defining battery to the facts in questionholding that in pennsylvania lack of informed consent claims utilize a battery standard that is a physician commits battery where the patient does not consent to the procedure on his person thus constituting a harmful or offensive contact & \n\n985 (3d Cir. 1988). In this case, it is evident that Prive\u2019s injury occurred in the context of Dr. Fabian\u2019s business activities. Clearly if Prive had tripped while in Dr. Fabian\u2019s office, see also Harad, supra at 985, had been exposed to disease because Dr. Fabian had improperly labeled laboratory samples, see Doe v. Doctors Bryan, Hatcher, Vick and Gastings, 623 So.2d 722 (Ct.App.La. 1993), or had injured herself moving a patient, see Duprey v. Shane, 249 P.2d 8, 13 (Ca. 1952), a medical malpractice action would not be warranted. As these cases recognize, the proper recourse for a physician\u2019s negligence toward nonpatients is a common law claim for negligence rather than a claim for medical malpractice. See Doe, supra at 723; see also Roe v. Federal Ins. Co., 412 Mass. 43, 49-50 (1992) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the exclusion clause in the holding that a patients settlement of a prior action brought against him by doctors for payment of a bill did not bar medical malpractice action against doctorsholding that doctors conduct toward patient that does not come within penumbra of doctorpatient relationship cannot form basis for malpractice actionholding that doctors may limit the extent of their responsibility to patients by narrowing the scope of the doctorpatient relationshipholding that provision would not be enforced due to that fact that the doctorpatient relationship is special and entitled to unique protectionholding that an obligation imposed by statute cannot form the basis for a statutory employer relationship & \n\n2d 353, 361 (1995). The term \u201cwrongfully caused\u201d refers to the point in time in which \u201cthe injured person becomes possessed of sufficient information concerning his injury and its cause to put a reasonable person on inquiry to determine whether actionable conduct is involved.\u201d Knox College v. Celotex Corp., 88 Ill. 2d 407, 416 (1981). Historically, the limitations period for bringing a wrongful death action has been regarded as a condition precedent, not modified or affected by the general statute of limitations. Fure v. Sherman Hospital, 64 Ill. App. 3d 259, 264 (1978). However, as plaintiff correctly notes, the discovery rule has been applied to wrongful death actions under certain circumstances. See, e.g., Coleman v. Hinsdale Emergency Medical Corp., 108 Ill. App. 3d 525, 529 (1982) (<HOLDING>); Fure, 64 Ill. App. 3d 259 (same). holding that a failure to include a beneficiary in a wrongful death action is a defect because the wrongful death act restricts plaintiffs to a single actionholding that a surviving spouse can bring a wrongful death action based on medical malpracticerecognizing cause of action for wrongful deathholding that plaintiffs failure to prove decedents death was caused by the wrongful acts of the defendant precludes any recovery of wrongful death damages under mississippis wrongful death statuteholding that discovery rule applied to wrongful death action predicated on medical malpractice & \n\nfor radiologists to or urologists or anybody else of the same specialty. Similarly, Dr. Venegas testified that as a family physician, he does not implant pacemakers and he would defer to the knowledge of a cardiologist on that issue. When Dr. Venegas was asked if he believed Dr. Feldman deviated from the standard of care in her treatment of Mr. Melton, he responded, \u201cI cannot see where from the note[s] that I\u2019ve been given from [Dr. Feldman] that she deviated from the standard of care in her medical treatment of Mr. Melton.\u201d Dr. Gaddy and Dr. Venegas failed to establish the standard of care for implanting ICDs, and therefore, their testimony was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. See Botehlo v. Bycura, 282 S.C. 578, 587, 320 S.E.2d 59, 65 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, Melton presented no evidence holding that expert medical testimony was not necessary to establish negligence where surgeon left a needle in the patients body but stating that proof of proximate cause requires some expert testimony in medical malpractice casesholding that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment since the physical evidence and unrebutted expert testimony left no genuine issue of material factholding no issue of material fact as to whether defendant was volunteer because he received no compensationholding expert testimony by an orthopedic surgeon in a case of alleged medical malpractice by a podiatrist failed to create a genuine issue of material fact because 1 the material question in the case was the standard required of podiatrists not orthopedic surgeons 2 the witness admitted he was not familiar with the procedure the defendant performed and 3 when the orthopedic surgeon was asked if he held himself out as an expert he answered no not in podiatry noholding that expert testimony is unnecessary when orthopedic surgeon failed to remove two pieces of cement totaling oneinch in diameter after affixing prosthesis for hip replacement & \n\nbe an incorrect or negligent medical judgment, but that alone does not give rise to deliberate indifference. See White, 897 F.2d at 108-09 (\u201cMere medical malpractice cannot give rise to a violation of the Eighth Amendment.\u201d); Rouse, 182 F.3d at 197 (\u201cIt is well-settled that claims of negligence or medical malpractice, without some more culpable state of mind, do not constitute deliberate indifference.\u201d). Nurse DeLorenzo did not refuse to provide required medical treatment without reason or prevent Mr. Thomas from receiving recommended medical treatment; instead she concluded \u2014 consistent with Prison medical policy \u2014 that no medical treatment was necessary or even available. This is not deliberate indifference. See Goodrich v. Clinton Cty. Prison, 214 Fed.Appx. 105, 112 (3d Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>); Chimenti v. Kimber, 133 Fed.Appx. 833, 836 holding that a difference of medical opinion was insufficient as a matter of law to establish deliberate indifferenceholding that plaintiffs claim that medical providers did not comply with baker act was not subject to medical malpractice statutes ajlthough a medical diagnosis is necessary in order to involuntarily commit a patient the process of complying with the statute does not require medical skill or judgmentholding that a medical professional clearly indicated an exercise of medical judgment rather than deliberate indifference where the medical professional engaged in a goodfaith clinical assessment of plaintiffs symptoms concluding on several visits that his condition did not warrant medicationholding that a sentence of incarceration would constitute deliberate indifference to defendants medical needsholding that deliberate indifference to a serious medical need establishes an eighth amendment violation & \n\ndistributed. Inasmuch as the Ohio Legislature has not expressly adopted a discovery rule in libel and\/or invasion of privacy cases and because of the single publication rule, the cause of action as to the plaintiff in her libel and invasion-of-privacy claims accrued in December 1975. Therefore, this Court concludes the present case is not timely filed. PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM FOR INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS The plaintiff Donda R. Morgan also contends that she has brought an independent action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that this cause of action did not accrue until the first time she was aware of the picture. The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is a new and recognized theory of a tort action. See Yeager v. Local Union 20, supra (<HOLDING>). In the present case, the plaintiff has only holding that act did not bar intentional infliction of emotional distress claimrecognizing validity of cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distressrecognizing torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distressholding that intentional infliction of emotional distress is a personal injury tortholding that a tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is distinct from a claim for emotional distress damages under the employment discrimination statute & \n\nof trust relative to Medicare. Additionally, Garrison did not-hold a position of discretion concerning her crime of false reporting to Medicare, as required for application of the abuse-of-trust enhancement. As her counsel explained at sentencing, Garrison lacked the discretion and ability to conceal the false cost reports submitted for Medicare, reimbursement and relied on others to accomplish this deception. In contrast to Garrison\u2019s lack of discretion and inability to produce the fraudulent Medicare reimbursement requests as section 3B1.3 envisions is a physician who possesses the expertise to create erroneous medical records and, consequently, fraudulent Medicare reports that are difficult to deteet and to question. Cf. United States v. Rutgard, 108 F.3d 1041, 1064 (9th Cir.) (<HOLDING>), amended on other grounds, 116 F.3d 1270, 1293 holding that no physicianpatient relationship between doctor who gave informal opinion over telephone at request of treating physician and minor patient whose case was discussed and thus doctor did not owe duty of care to patientholding that a question of fact existed regarding whether the hospital held the doctor out as its agent if the hospital provided the doctor without explicitly informing the patient that the doctor was not its employeeholding that fault may not be assessed against a patient in a medical malpractice action in which a patients negligent conduct provides only the occasion for the medical attention care or treatment which is the basis for the action where the defendant doctor was treating the plaintiff patient for injuries sustained in a car accident negligently caused by the plaintiff who was driving while intoxicatedholding that the section 3b13 enhancement was warranted because the ophthalmologist convicted for medicare fraud abused the trust implicit in a in a professional medical practice because of the essential trust between patient and physician and because the government as insurer depends upon the honesty of the doctor and is easily taken advantage of if the doctor is not honestholding erisa did not apply when doctor was not employee of the medical association of the state of alabama & \n\nthe brief of a pro se appellant, Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993), and thus read Hulsey's brief to argue that Owens and Green are not immune from suit or liability for damages. 2 . Heck v. Humphrey prevents an action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when the complaint, directly or indirectly, challenges the legality of the complainant's conviction or imprisonment. Id. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. A \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must first prove that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated in a proper pro ceeding prior to bringing a \u00a7 1983 action. Id. If the sentence or conviction has not been invalidated there can be no action for damages under \u00a7 1983, and the statute of limitations does not begin to run. Id.; see also Stephenson v. Reno, 28 F.3d 26, 27 (5th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). Consequently, the statute of limitations on holding that that if the success of a 1983 damages claim brought by a prisoner would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence the prisoner may only bring the claim where the conviction or sentence has been invalidatedrecognizing that 1983 action does not accrue until conviction or sentence has been invalidatedholding that right to payment does not accrue until condition precedent has been fulfilledholding that a claim for damages that would invalidate a conviction or sentence that has not already been invalidated or reversed on direct appeal by executive order by an authorized state tribunal or by a writ of habeas corpus is not cognizable under 1983holding that a plaintiff requesting relief under 1983 had no cause of action unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed expunged invalidated or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus & \n\nprovided, however, that: (t \u215d \u215c \u215d \u201c(2) In respect to those injuries or damages due to acts of medical * * * malpractice which could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence be discoverable at the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action, suit shall be commenced within three (3) years of the time that the act or acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.\u201d (Emphases added.) Under the plain language of \u00a7 9-1-14.1, in order to toll the malpractice statute of limitations, there must be a finding that the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence at the time the injury occurred, yet failed to discover a wrongful act on the part of the defendant. See Grossi v. Miriam Hospital, 689 A.2d 403, 404 (R.I.1997) (<HOLDING>). In contrast, the tolling provision contained holding prescription defense available to wife who asserted that she was holding her husbands pills on his behalfholding erisa did not apply when doctor was not employee of the medical association of the state of alabamaholding that a wifes minimal involvement in her husbands business coupled with the lack of evidence that she knew of or intended to further her husbands fraudulent schemes was insufficient evidence of conspiracyholding that the tolling provision of 91141 did not apply when the plaintiff knew that medical negligence may have contributed to her husbands death but asserted that she did not know the identity of the doctor who treated himholding that where petitioner testified she did not know who fired shots at her ear or why the evidence did not compel the conclusion that the shooting was based on her political opinion & \n\nconcealment rule states that when facts essential to the cause of action are fraudulently concealed, the statute of limitations is tolled until the plaintiff has discovered such facts or could have done so in the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Bricker v. Putnam, 128 N.H. 162, 165 (1986). Here, the rule is inapplicable because, as the trial court found, the plaintiff knew, or \u201cin the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the causal r 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (NewYork courts \u201cdo not generally regard the accountant-client relationship as a fiduciary one\u201d (quotation omitted)), there is no support in our case law for the proposition that a limitations period is tolled in fiduciary cases until the fiduciary discloses his or her misconduct. See Furbush, 149 N.H. at 430-31 (<HOLDING>). Moreover, despite the defendants\u2019 failure to holding that although the defendantattorney did not disclose to the plaintiff his failure to file a claim in a timely manner the limitations period on the legal malpractice claim began to run when the plaintiff could reasonably discern that he suffered some harm caused by the defendants conductholding that the date on which the plaintiff learned of the defendants denial of tenure not the date on which the plaintiff became unemployed was when the statute of limitations began to runholding that the statute of limitations for an attorney malpractice suit did not begin to run until the client had suffered some actual damageholding that the statute of limitations for a miscalculation of benefits claim began to run at the time at which some event other than a denial of a claim should have alerted the claimant to his entitlement to the benefits he did not receiveholding that statute of limitations for malpractice begins to run when plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the alleged malpractice & \n\nthe Eighth Circuit held that the state law claims were indeed preempted by ERISA, reasoning that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims all relied on Mr. Kuhl\u2019s status as a beneficiary under the employer\u2019s health benefits plan and arose from the administration of benefits under the plan. Id. Specifically, the Eighth Circuit agreed with the district court that [ajrtful pleading by characterizing Lincoln National\u2019s actions in refusing to pay for the surgery as \u201ccancellation\u201d or by characterizing the same administrative decisions as \u201cmalpractice\u201d does not change the fact that plaintiffs\u2019 claims are based on the contention that Lincoln National improperly processed [Mr.] Kuhl\u2019s claim for medical benefits. Id. at 303; see also Pomeroy v. Johns Hopkins Med. Servs., Inc., 868 F.Supp. 110, 114 (D.Md.1994) (<HOLDING>). 4. Plaintiffs\u2019 State Law Claims Initially, we recognizing validity of cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distressholding that employees claims for medical malpractice negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress against an hmo arising out of refusal to pay for surgery were integrally and inextricably related to their employee benefit plan and therefore preemptedrecognizing the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distressrecognizing torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distressholding that a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was preempted where it arose out of the same conduct as a preempted contract claim & \n\nheld that Prostok\u2019s claims do not collaterally attack the confirmation order because they are based on conduct extrinsic to the confirmation order. 112 S.W.3d 876, 905. This Court has held that when a party does not seek to set aside a prior judgment, but instead brings suit based on extrinsic fraud, the action is not a collateral attack. State v. Durham, 860 S.W.2d 63, 67 (Tex.1993) (recognizing, in a suit brought by the state for fraud in obtaining court approval for an oil and gas lease, that the State had not sought to set aside the judgment but had \u201calleged fraud extrinsic to the judgment, and invoke[d] the equity powers of the court to impose a constructive trust\u201d); cf. Spera v. Fleming, Hovenkamp & Grayson, P.C., 25 S.W.3d 863, 871 (Tex.App.\u2014 Houston [14th DistJ 2000, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). In contrast, the underlying issues resolved holding that debtors have no right to jury trial on malpractice claims against their attorneysholding that extrinsic conduct that formed the basis of claims for attorney malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty were not a collateral attack on trial courts order apportioning attorneys feesholding breach of fiduciary duty claim is essentially a negligence or professional malpractice claimholding that there would be no exception to american rule on attorney fees for legal malpractice claimsholding that attorneys fees and costs expended as a result of an attorneys alleged malpractice constitute legallycognizable damages for purposes of stating a claim for such malpractice & \n\nargue that their claim for fraud did not accrue until at least September 25, 1992, the date of the consent judgment for civil forfeiture. Plaintiffs filed their complaint in state court on September 23, 1998. Under Michigan law, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff can allege each element of the asserted claim. Moll v.

Further, Michigan courts apply the discovery rule, whereby a claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, an injury and causal connection between his injury and the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id. (discussing discovery rule in the context of a products liability action); Agristor Fin. Corp. v. Van Sickle, 967 F.2d 233, 236-38 (6th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>).

Thus, because all four requirements of issue preclusion are met here, Harline is bound by the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual finding that he acted with the requisite state of mind to support a denial of discharge despite Vlahos\u2019 negligent preparation of the statement of affairs and schedules. Thus, Harline has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that Vlahos proximately caused the denial of Harline\u2019s bankruptcy dis L.Ed.2d 101 (1990); Falconer v.

Jaburg & Wilk, P.C., 177 Ariz. 221, 866 P.2d 889, 895-96 (Ct.App.1993) (<HOLDING>). Because Har-line is precluded from holding that bankruptcy court ruling that debtors first attorney did not commit malpractice by failing to inform debtor of deadline precluded same claim in state court against different attorneysholding that the district court had bankruptcy jurisdiction over a professional malpractice action filed by a title 11 debtor against the law firm that represented him in his bankruptcy case under section 1334b because the malpractice claim arose in the bankruptcy caseholding that suit for professional malpractice was compulsory counterclaim to earlier award of fees in bankruptcy to debtors attorneyholding that a corporate chapter 7 debt ors malpractice claim against its bankruptcy attorney was related to its bankruptcy caseholding that debtors have no right to jury trial on malpractice claims against their attorneys & \n\nAfter discussing these and other findings by Dr. Scardigli, the ALJ sweepingly concluded: In reviewing the record in its entirely, we find that the opinion of Dr. Scardigli that Mr. Schonewolf was unable to work is inconsistent with her narrative and clinical findings. (R. 16.) This is hardly an explanation as to why Dr. Scardigli\u2019s opinion is unreliable, as the ALJ never even attempts to explain why Dr. Scardigli\u2019s conclusions are inconsistent with her own findings. The ALJ has no basis for concluding that his interpretation of Dr. Scardigli\u2019s findings is valid while her own conclusions are unreliable; or if he has such a basis, he never discusses it in his opinion. The ALJ, therefore, invalidly substitutes his medical conclusions for those of the physician. Kent, 710 F.2d at 115 (<HOLDING>).

Thus, the responses to the questionnaires must themselves fall within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rale. Cf. In re G.Y., 962 P.2d 78, 85 (Utah Ct. App. 1998) (<HOLDING>). Because the Spa does not contend that the holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were madeholding that exclusion of hearsay statements violated due process even though statements were not admissible under mississippi law which did not recognize declarations against penal interest as a exception to the rule against hearsayholding that factors used in determining whether hearsay statements are sufficiently reliable to satisfy hearsay exceptions also apply to whether statements have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness under confrontation clauseholding that thirdparty statements contained in dcfs caseworker reports constituted hearsayrecognizing that the united states constitution may require courts to admit exculpatory hearsay statements that do not fall within any recognized hearsay exception & \n\nsimply did not bar the use of the residual exception. We note that Judge Wiss dissented from the Court\u2019s decision on this issue and complained \u201cthat the majority has erred by shuffling past one of the three absolute prerequisites for admission of hearsay under\u201d the residual exception by passing over the fact that the child\/vietim in Morgan was available and did testify, albeit in a somewhat limited manner. 40 M.J. at 413 (Wiss, J., dissenting).

The court explained that the evidence, \u201cwhich describes the emotional, physical, and verbal abusive acts by the Defendant towards the victim and his controlling nature is relevant to show ... the state of mind of both the vict 728, 730 (2001) (<HOLDING>); State v.

Defendants argue that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding these allegations because Plaintiffs assertions are inadmissible hearsay and because Plaintiff failed to create a nexus between the discriminatory acts she described and her alleged termination. Defendants fail on both accounts. Plaintiffs assertions are not hearsay. See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1094-1095 (1st Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, Plaintiff does not need to show holding that in employees age discrimination suit against former employer supervisors statement to employee was not hearsay even though the statement was offered for its truth because the statement was an admission by a party opponentholding that a text message constituted hearsay insofar as it was offered to prove the truth of the statement assertedholding that the district courts improper admission of an unauthenticated registration statement was harmless because the proponent of the registration statement later properly authenticated the statement in a motion to reconsiderholding that defendant who introduced hearsay statement waived objection to admission of another part of same statementholding that a hearsay statement can itself be considered in first determining if a conspiracy existed when the statement was made & \n\nthat J.C. told her mother the details of the charged offenses. Further, the State informed the trial court at the article 38.072 hearing that J.C.\u2019s mother was under indictment for failing to report appellant\u2019s abuse of J.C., was unavailable to talk to the prosecutor, refused to cooperate with the police, and refused to admit that J.C. made an outcry statement to her. Appellant did not dispute the State\u2019s assertions. See Pitts v. State, 916 S.W.2d 507, 510 (Tex.Crim.App.1996) (\u201cThis Court accepts as true factual assertions made by counsel which are not disputed by opposing counsel.\u201d). Urban was the first adult to whom an outcry statement was made who could remember J.C.\u2019s statement and relate it at trial. See Foreman v. State, 995 S.W.2d 854, 858-59 (Tex.App.-Austin 1999, pet. ref'd) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added). 2. Reliability of the outcry holding that article 38072 allows the first adult who can remember and relate at trial the childs statement to be the outcry witnessholding that the trial court did not err in allowing a witness to testify regarding the child victims hearsay statements prior to the child testifying because ocga 24316 allows testimony about a childs outofcourt statements even in cases when the child does not appear as a witness as long as the child is available at the trial to testifyholding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that admission of a witness prior identification statement where the witness could not remember the basis for the identification did not violate the confrontation clause or fedrevid 802holding tape recorded statement given to police shortly after criminal incident was inadmissible under section 908035 when witness did not remember its contents and did not testify that it correctly reflected her knowledge or that she tried to be truthful at the time she made the statement & \n\nconvicted and bore no relationship to any other pertinent matter. That being said, I would caution that the fact that witness Berry saw defendant in the area may have been relevant evidence. However, I address only the propriety of the admission into evidence of witness Berry\u2019s reiteration of the woman\u2019s statements, as opposed to witness Berry\u2019s testimony that she saw defendant in the area. While defendant\u2019s presence may have been relevant, the statements of Ms. Love, who did not testify at trial and who made no comment incriminating defendant with respect to the charged crimes was not relevant evidence. 2 While no Michigan case has addressed this issue, I note the following federal cases in support of my position: Krulewitch v United States, 336 US 440; 69 S Ct 716; 93 L Ed 790 (1949) (<HOLDING>); United States v Reynolds, 715 F2d 99, 103 (CA holding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding that when defendant was guilty of burglary but the only evidence that he was armed was from his own statement existence of the firearm went only to the degree of the offense and was not as an element of proofholding where neither defense counsel nor the trial court explained to the defendant that intent to cause death was an element of seconddegree murder and there was no factual statement or admission implying intent the plea was involuntaryholding that the outofcourt statement by the victims mother which was admitted when the mother refused to testify at trial was inadmissible under residual hearsay exception in mil revid 804b5 because a much of her statement was double or triple hearsay that was most unreliable and b the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement were not supported by any particularized guarantees of trustworthinessholding that hearsay within a police report was inadmissible & \n\nstatement that Shaw paid him $8,900 to bum Shaw\u2019s house would likely make him vulnerable to a prosecution for \u201ccommission of a felony for hire.\u201d Even though Russo\u2019s statement implicates Shaw in the burning of the house, the statement that Shaw paid Russo to bum the house is a necessary predicate to the crime of \u201ccommission of a felony for hire.\" Therefore, Russo\u2019s statement, even though it implicates Shaw, would be \u201cself-inculpatory\u201d under the reasoning of Williamson. See Williamson, 114 S.Ct. at 2436-37. See also United States v. Seeley, 892 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989) (indicating that, because \u201cstatements against penal interest\" is a firmly rooted hearsay exception, a court can infer the reliability of such evidence). But see United States v. Flores, 985 F.2d 770 (5th Cir. 1993) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiff further argues that Russo\u2019s holding that statements within a firmly rooted hearsay exception do not violate the confrontation clauseholding that it did not violate the confrontation clause of the united states constitution to convict defendant for conspiracy to distribute controlled substance based upon a lab report admitted under the federal business records exception rule because this exception was firmly rootedholding codefendants confession incriminating defendant was not within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule under roberts standardholding that rule 8034 hearsay exception is firmly rooted for sixth amendment purposesholding that the exception is not firmly rooted & \n\nhave merit. Carnahan\u2019s statement to Det. Tecklen-burg was an out-of-court statement \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d i.e. that David was involved in the conspiracy and served in the role of money collector or \u201cmuscle\u201d for Martin. Fed. R Evid. 801(c). David made a timely objection to the admission of this aspect of Det. Tecklenburg\u2019s testimony, and we find no applicable exclusion to the hearsay definition nor exception to the general rule of inadmissibility that would permit Det. Tecklenburg\u2019s testimony. Carnahan was a cooperating informant and his statement to Det. Tecklenburg was made in that capacity, not in the capacity of co-conspirator and not in furtherance of the conspiracy. See United States v. Alonzo, 991 F.2d 1422, 1425-26 (8th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). Also, it is not clear that Pieters\u2019s holding that statements by a cooperating coconspirator to known authorities made after the commencement of cooperation are not admissible under rule 801d2e because such statements are not made in furtherance of the conspiracyholding that statements made to keep a coconspirator informed as to the groups drug supply were made in furtherance of the conspiracyholding that post arrest statements made by coconspirator to law enforcement officer were not admissible under rule 801d2e but admission of testimony was harmless because officers testimony was cumulativeholding a trial court should not allow a jury to hear outofcourt coconspirator declarations before holding a hearing outside the jurys presence to determine whether such statements are admissible under federal rule of evidence 801d2eholding that statements aimed at preventing detection and punishment were not admissible under the coconspirator exception because admission of such statements would expand exception to hearsay rule to include declarations made not in furtherance of conspiracy charged but made in furtherance of an alleged implied but uncharged conspiracy aimed at preventing detection and punishment & \n\nstatement as true at the time she gave it; that she was still consumed with the emotions of the event when talking with police; and that other evidence corroborated her statement, we find that there was sufficient evidence to lay a foundation for admission of the statement under section 90.803(5), even though the declarant herself never confirmed the accuracy of the statement at trial. Admission of Evidence Regarding Victim\u2019s Identification of Polite from a Photo Line-Up Polite next contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of Ms. Levine\u2019s out-of-court identification of him from a photo line-up on grounds that the State failed to inquire into this issue during its direct examination of Ms. Levine. E.g., Deans v. State, 988 So.2d 1271 (Fla. 5th DCA 2008) (<HOLDING>); Neilson v. State, 713 So.2d 1110 (Fla. 2d DCA holding defendant waived right to challenge incourt identification when he admitted guilt at punishment phase of trialholding that appellant was not lawfully detained for investigation of public intoxication when he gave false identification therefore trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress his false identification statementsholding that trial court erred when it admitted outofcourt identification of defendant when the witness who made the identification was never asked about defendants identity at trialholding that testimony regarding outofcourt identification was inadmissible where the state failed to ask the witnesses about the identification during its direct examinationholding that prior identification is not hearsay when the declarant is available at trial for crossexamination and that it makes no difference whether the witness admits or denies or fails to recall making the prior identification & \n\nreport constitutes an admission of a party-opponent, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. Snizaski counters that she offered the police accident report solely to establish the approximate time of the accident and, therefore, was not an admission of the truth of the substantive statements contained in the report. Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 802 provides that hearsay is not admissible unless some exception applies. \u201cA police report prepared by an officer who is not a witness to the accident is inadmissible hearsay evidence and should not be admitted into evidence. Nor should a party be able to get such a report into evidence in an indirect manner.\u201d Holland v. Zelnick, 329 Pa.Super. 469, 478 A.2d 885, 888 (1984); See Johnson v. Peoples Cab Company, 386 Pa. 513, 126 A.2d 720 (1956) (<HOLDING>); accord Harvey v. Doliner, 399 Pa. 356, 160 holding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding that a report of a police officer who arrived at an accident scene minutes after a collision which contained a statement that one of the vehicles traveled through a stop sign was inadmissible hearsay evidenceholding that witness statements in police report inadmissibleholding that the defendant was guilty of leaving the scene because the injured party and a police officer were present at the scene within a reasonable time after the accidentholding that hearsay within a police report was inadmissible & \n\nthey qualified as an excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay. As well, we agree with Haygood that the circuit court erred in distinguishing this case from Crawford on the bases that the statement in Crawford (1) was taken in a custodial interrogation and (2) was not an excited utterance. First, the fact that the statements here were not taken at a police station during custodial interrogation, although a proper factor to consider, is not dispositive. See Davis, 547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (considering the difference in the level of formality between the interview in the station house in Crawford and the frantic 911 call in Davis as one of the factors in determining whether the statements from the 911 call were testimonial); Hammon, 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (<HOLDING>); Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1166-67 (considering the recognizing the crawford interrogation was more formal but determining the interrogation of hammons wife was formal enough in considering that factor and determining the wifes statements were testimonialrecognizing that there are no formal procedures for determining the validity of rs 2477 claimsholding that edwards protection only extends to interrogation and that denial of counsel is only one factor to be considered in determining whether consent was voluntarily given but it is not a decisive factholding that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of an allegedly coerced interrogation where the taped interrogation was played for jurors and the defendant crossexamined the witness at length about the interrogationholding that the sixth amendment generally permits interrogation of a represented person only 1 if it was the defendant and not the government who initiated the interrogation and 2 if the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel & \n\nand to have that determination declared presumptive evidence of disability and inability to work, subject only to rebuttal by the defense. We begin our analysis with the Rules of Evidence and the principle that \u201chearsay statements that do not conform to the exceptions specifically enumerated in the Rules of Evidence are not admissible.\u201d State v. Rose, 206 N.J. 141, 175, 19 A.3d 985 (2011). It is clear that the SSA determination is hearsay and was proffered explicitly for the truth of the finding therein. \u201c \u2018Hearsay\u2019 is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d N.J.R.E. 801(c). See Muench v. Twp. of Haddon, 255 N.J.Super. 288, 305-06, 605 A.2d 242 (App.Div.1992) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v. Erie Lackawanna R.R.

Id. at 907, 909-10. In the present case, Schleider had been in the restaurant business since 1974, during which time he had arranged many loans. He testified there had been \u201crenewals and everything had been via telephone. We\u2019d go in and sign what we talked about on the te d 723, 730, 732-33 (N.D.Tex.1999) (<HOLDING>). We conclude there is no evidence to support holding no justifiable reliance as a matter of lawholding that whether the plaintiffs reliance on a negligent misrepresentation is justified generally raises a question of factholding as a matter of law no justifiable reliance on statements like the deal is real and we will fund next week also observing statement loan was a done deal not sufficient to support claim for negligent misrepresentationholding standard under section 523a2a is justifiable relianceholding negligent misrepresentation sufficient & \n\nfrom the plaintiffs expert that the cost to replace the items taken from the facility \u201cwould have been nearly $300,000.\u201d In addition, the jury cannot be faulted for using replacement cost as the measure of recovery. Evidence of the replacement cost was admitted, and the jurors were simply instructed that, if they determined the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the property, they were also to \u201cdetermine the value of that property as of the date of trial.\u201d They were not instructed that \u201cvalue\u201d meant market value, not replacement cost. Under these circumstances, we do not believe the jury\u2019s award of replacement cost at a level proposed by the plaintiffs expert was so far outside the range of evidence as to suggest the jury was motivated by passion. See Schmitt, 170 N.W.2d at 660-61 (<HOLDING>). A similar view can be reasonably taken of the holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial courtholding that appellate courts determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction based on a review of all of the evidence admitted at trialholding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objectionholding new trial cannot be based on claim of prejudice arising from jurys reliance on evidence admitted without objectionholding any error in admission of evidence cured when same evidence later admitted without objection & \n\n\u201cstrategic\u201d decision entitled to deference is a \u201cconscious, reasonably informed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client\u201d). In contrast, there is no allegation in this case that defense counsel failed to investigate the relevant alibi witnesses, or failed to file the required notice of alibi. The fact that defense counsel conducted a mock trial demonstrates that their decision not to call such witnesses was a quintessential strategic decision entitled to the highest level of deference under Strickland. While defense counsel promised alibi evidence during his opening statement, his failure to introduce the wives\u2019 testimony does not, in and of itself, constitute constitutionally deficient performance.

Bowersox, 340 F.3d 667, holding that failure to object to admissible evidence was not ineffective assistance of counselholding that trial counsels failure to call defendants family members as witnesses during penalty phase was reasonable trial strategy and not ineffective assistance of counselholding that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim for counsels failure to present the preindictment delay issue was without merit because there was no actual prejudice to the supposed alibi defense as the now unavailable witnesses would not have provided the defendant with an alibi for the time when the murder could have occurredholding the failure to call alibi witnesses promised during opening statement was not ineffective assistance of counselholding that the failure to call certain witnesses was not ineffective assistance because witnesses already presented similar evidence and counsel is not required to present cumulative evidence & \n\nthat he told the same story before the motive or influence came into existence or before the time of the alleged recent fabrication. [In those circumstances], the prior consistent statement is defined as not hearsay . . . and thus is admitted into evidence. Unless a witness\u2019s veracity has affirmatively been placed in issue, the witness\u2019s prior consistent statement is pure hearsay evidence, which cannot be admitted merely to corroborate the witness, or to bolster the witness\u2019s credibility in the eyes of the jury. Woodard, 269 Ga. at 320 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original). Put another way, \u201cto be admissible to refute the allegation of recent fabrication, improper influence, or improper motive, the prior statement must\u2018predate the alleged fabrication, in 05 SE2d 649) (2011) (<HOLDING>); Duggan, 285 Ga. at 366 (holding that holding testimony that defendant had no response to question during police interview was not impermissible comment on his constitutional right to remain silent where defendant had voluntarily waived his miranda rightsholding that the defendants cellmates statement given to the police in a pretrial interview did not predate the cellmates alleged motive to fabricate his testimony to obtain a plea deal on his pending federal drug chargesholding that a defendant who has successfully challenged his plea in one ease should be allowed to withdraw his plea in a second case when both cases were part of one negotiated settlement of his chargesholding that a defendant who is allowed to withdraw his plea must either withdraw his plea to all charges or to none when his plea to all charges was part of an agreement with the stateholding that a codefendants prior statements made at his guilty plea hearing were not admissible to corroborate his trial testimony because the witnesss guilty plea hearing did not predate any improper motive he may have had to testify against the defendant & \n\nno matter how quickly and ably given, could salvage a fair trial for the defendant.\u201d). Moreover, apparently the only reason the State sought to introduce the prior inconsistent statement was its belief that the jury would be swayed by the statement when determining guilt, or innocence. See United States v. Webster, 734 F.2d 1191, 1192 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201c[I]t would be an abuse of the [impeachment] rule, in a criminal case, for the prosecution to call a witness that it knew would not give it useful evidence, just\u201d so it could introduce hearsay evidence against the defendant in the hope that the jury would miss the subtle distinction between impeachment and substantive evidence \u2014 or, if it didn\u2019t miss it, would ignore it.\u201d (emphasis added)).

United States v. Young Bros., Inc., 728 F.2d 682, 693 (5th Cir.1984). Thus, the issue is whether the amendment to the serial number constituted a change in form akin to correcting a typographical error or a change in substance that impermissibly altered the indictment. Although we have never addressed this question directly, precedent from this circuit and others suggests that the particular attributes of a firearm are not actual elements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 150 F.3d 401, 417 (5th Cir.1998) (finding no grounds to reverse conviction when indictment charged a dif ferent gauge of shotgun than that presented during trial); United States v. Robinson, 974 F.2d 575, 578 (5th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Robison, 904 F.2d 365, 369 holding that government may prove facts outside the overt acts alleged in the indictmentholding that when an indictment alleges nonessential facts the government need not prove them in order to sustain a convictionholding that the government need not prove actual notice to the prisonerrecognizing that the government need only prove that crime occurred reasonably near the date stated in the indictmentholding that the fact of prior convictions under 924e need not be charged in an indictment and proven to a jury and also that the government need not charge in an indictment and prove to a jury that a defendants prior conviction constitutes a violent felony under 924e & \n\nRule 29(c)). 9 . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) states, in relevant part; It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 10 .It is not clear whether the government attempted to demonstrate that the pistol and rifle were acquired separately and at different times or places. If they did not make such a showing, the indictment under which Alanis was charged would be duplicitous under our recent holding in United States v. Buchmeier, 255 F.3d 415, 422 (7th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The defense did not challenge the indictment holding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involvedholding that when the indictment charges that a certain minimum quantity of drugs is involved in the offense proof of that quantity is a fourth element of the offenseholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that the quantity of drugs involved in an offense does not support a downward departure because the legislature intended the quantity of drugs to be a determining factor in varying penaltiesholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that count & \n\nof self-defense, and a person is just as capable of defending himself with a marked firearm as with an unmarked firearm. With or without a serial number, a pistol is still a pistol. Furthermore, it cannot be the case that possession of a firearm in the home for self-defense is a protected form of possession under all circumstances. By this rationale, any type of firearm possessed in the home would be protected merely because it could be used for self-defense. Possession of machine guns or short-barreled shotguns \u2014 or any other dangerous and unusual weapon' \u2014 so long as they were kept in the home, would then fall within the Second Amendment. But the Supreme Court has made clear the Second Amendment does not protect those types of weapons. See Miller, 307 U.S. at 178, 59 S.Ct. 816 (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Fincher, 538 F.3d holding that when regulations are intended to have different purposes and are not dependent on each other they are not intertwinedholding that shortbarreled shotguns are unprotectedholding that arguments which are not sufficiently developed are waivedholding that arguments that are not raised or that are not accompanied by factual and legal support are deemed waivedholding that possession of a shortbarreled shotgun is a violent felony under the accas residual clause because sawedoff shotguns are inherently dangerous and lack usefulness except for violent and criminal purposes internal quotation marks omitted & \n\ncreating anger or resentment and a cross burning done with the [constitutionally proscribable] purpose of threatening or intimidating a victim\u201d), 374 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing that the First Amendment prohibits the conviction of a person for cross burning without the intent to intimidate, but concluding that the number of such convictions likely to occur under the Virginia statute was too small to render the statute facially overbroad). 20 Pet. for Review, State v.

Absent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too little protection in too many instances.\u201d Id. at 461. The Seventh Circuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to Holley. See United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 471 (7th Cir.1998). But see United States v.

On April 30, 1993, the court dismissed all the charges against Woodland without prejudice. In October of 1993, new charges were filed. During the approximately seven months separating the dismissal and the reinstatement of charges, Woodland was confined in a mental institution. This period of confinement involved no formal charges. Woodland was not held because he was an alleged criminal but because his mental health at the time warranted such confinement. This period should not be used to calculate a speedy trial violation. See Trafny, 799 P.2d at 706 (stating that time spent holding defendant on separate parole violation following formal dismissal of charges cannot be attributable to state); see also Johnson v. United States, 333 F.2d 371, 374 (10th Cir.1964) (<HOLDING>).

Obviously, it\u2019s not unusual for participants in a trial to watch the jury, but we want to be sure that the jury is not made uncomfortable. So if I\u2019m correct that the regular attendees have been members of the family or friends of the defendants, I would appreciate counsel commenting to them when and as appropriate that we don\u2019t want to make the jurors uncomfortable, and what\u2019s actually a lot more interesting about a trial is what goes on in the well of the court and from the witness stand as opposed to the jury. So I share that with you just so you can convey the court\u2019s mild concern that the jurors not be made uncomfortable. It\u2019s nothing more than that. Okay? J.A. 915-16.

It is proper for the jury to be charged in the disjunctive even though the indictment (or information) may allege the differing methods of committing the offense in the conjunctive. Kitchens v. State, 823 S.W.2d 256, 258 (Tex.Crim.App.1991). In this connection, alternative theories of committing the same offense are properly submitted to the jury in the disjunctive if the evidence is sufficient to support a finding under any of the theories submitted. Id; see also Rosales v. State, 4 S.W.3d 228, 231 (Tex.Crim.App.1999) (<HOLDING>). This comports with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s holding when a statute defines manner or means of committing an offense indictment need not allege matters beyond the language of the statuteholding although indictment may allege manner and means of committing offense in the conjunctive jury may be charged in the disjunctive and a conviction on any method alleged will be upheld if the evidence supports itholding that when an indictment charges several acts in the conjunctive the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts chargedholdingthat an error in instructing the jury that an offense could be committed by a statutory method not charged in the indictment is cured where the court provides the jury with the indictment and instructs jurors that the burden of proof rests upon the state to prove every material allegation of the indictment and every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt citation omittedholding that for purposes of 18 usc 924c1 the law is well established that where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means & \n\nclaiming that the district court failed to consider the effect that one of section 9(l)\u2019s three factors \u2014 the \u201cseriousness of the [defendant\u2019s] offense\u201d \u2014 had on its decision to dismiss without, as opposed to with, prejudice.

The district court discussed section 9(l)\u2019s three-factor standard in its June 7, 2002 Order setting Smith\u2019s motion for hearing, and the Government argued the seriousness of Smith\u2019s offense at the hearing. Though the district court did not make an express finding to the effect, Smith\u2019s offense was, in fact, quite serious. See, e.g., United States v.

Therefore, the court holds that the second indictment in this case can properly be referred to as a \u201csuperseding\u201d indictment. The superseding-versus-new-indictment issue might have been an interesting and relevant debate if the Speedy Trial Act or the statute of limitations were the focus of defendants\u2019 appeals from the Detention Order, because those are the only situations in which it matters whether an indictment is a superseding indictme (D.C.1979) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

The result is the same regardless whether our review is de novo or for plain error. According to the Court, Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury. Alleyne v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (internal citations omitted) (<HOLDING>). However, Joseph and Dunbar do not challenge holding that to apply the firearm enhancement the firearm need only reflect the context of the defendants possession and the defendants ability to use the firearm to promote the controlled substance offenseholding that use certainly includes brandishing a firearm quotation marks omittedholding defendants minimum sentence could not be increased for brandishing a firearm where based on jury instructions jury convicted defendant of the lesser offense of carrying rather than brandishing the firearmholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that the trial court was not entitled to impose a threeyear mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon where the jury verdict did not specifically find actual possession & \n\nand impose a prison term up to the statutory maximum, Ra-gin\u2019s revocation sentence is not clearly unreasonable. Therefore, we conclude that Ragin\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.

Finally, while it is not entirely clear if it intends this argument to apply in the correction context, we note that Fargo argues that the prosecution history supports only one reasonable construction of claim 8. IRIS maintains, however, that under Novo Industries our inquiry is com p\u00edete if the proper way to correct the error is not apparent from the face of the patent, even if the proper correction is clear from the prosecution history. Fargo is correct in so far as it argues that the prosecution history is to be consulted to determine whether the error is subject to only one reasonable construction. See Hoffer v. Microsoft Corp., 405 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). The error must be evident on the face of the holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be raised on direct appeal when the facts supporting the claim are presented on the face of the recordholding that when two patents issued from continuationinpart appliea tions derived from one original application the prosecution history of a claim limitation in the first patent to issue was properly applied to the same claim limitation in the second patent to issueholding a technical term used in a patent document is interpreted as having the meaning that it would be given by persons experienced in the field of the invention unless it is apparent from the patent and the prosecution history that the inventor used the term with a different meaningholding that a court can correct a patent claim for a grammatical error where the prosecution history does not suggest a different interpretation of the claimsholding that claim 22 which depends from nonexistent claim 38 could be corrected because the error in the dependency was evident based on the face of the patent and that the correct antecedent claim was apparent from the prosecution history & \n\naward, do not justify overturning that award.

Clark Controller Co., 364 F.2d 225, 227 (6th Cir.1966) (<HOLDING>). The de fendant attempts to distinguish cases holding that wjhile it is certainly the better practice to specifically rule on all pending motions the determination of a motion need not always be expressed but may be implied by an entiy of an order inconsistent with granting the relief soughtholding death sentence need not be pending in order for this court to engage in review of issues on appealholding order granting motion to withdraw plea to be the functional equivalent of an order granting a new trial because like a postverdict mistrial it returns case to posture it had been before trialholding that the scheduling order merely prescribes the date by which all motions to amend shall be filed the date on the scheduling order does not confine the district courts consideration of the merits of such motions and does not preclude it from finding that an amendment would result in prejudiceholding interpretation may not be inconsistent with regulation & \n\ndifferent place in the superseding indictment than it does in the statute makes no difference here. First, the \u201cattempt\u201d language appears after \u201cknowingly\u201d and before the other elements of the crime. \u201cAttempt\u201d can fairly be read to modify all of the elements that follow the word, not just the \u201cmeans or facility of interstate commerce\u201d element. Second, even if the \u201cattempt\u201d language in the superseding indictment is somewhat imprecise, this does not render the superseding indictment insufficient. \u201c[D]ue process does not require a recitation of the statute; it requires only that the [indictment] as a whole set forth the critical details of the offense charged.\u201d United States v. Lentsch, 369 F.3d 948, 953 (6th Cir.2004); see also United States v. Martinez, 981 F.2d 867, 872 (6th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Third, given the circumstances in which this holding that the government need not prove that the defendant actually knew the exact nature of the substance to establish mens rea knowledge of drugs illegality is sufficientholding that a mens rea of unlawfully in the indictment was sufficient because the indictment referenced the applicable statute which required a reckless mens reaholding convictions under fla stat 893131 qualify as serious drug offenses pursuant to the acca despite the florida statutes lack of a mens rea elementholding that an indictment gave sufficient notice when the indictment charged the elements of the offenseholding that an indictment that omitted the mens rea element was sufficient because it cited the applicable statutes which informed the defendant of the elements of the charged offenses & \n\nof fact in a Terry stop). Where, as here, police officers themselves are responsible for the mistake (as opposed to police functionaries), the application of the rule is more efficacious still. But ignoring these deficiencies, and assuming without finding that Swierk and Mitchell simply misheard Antone say \u201ccome on\u201d (when he really said \u201chold on\u201d), the Court finds that an objectively reasonable police officer would not have believed that Antone consented to the entry of his home. As previously discussed, Det. Swierk asked Antone whether he would come to the police station, and Antone said that he would. To a reasonable person, Antone\u2019s unsolicited statement, \u201ccome on,\u201d would have been a puzzling follow up to Det. Swierk\u2019s introduction and question. Cf. Marshall, 348 F.3d at 286-88 (<HOLDING>). The statement that the detectives thought holding that acquiescence to a strip and body cavity search did not extend the scope of defendants consent to search his person because of the highly intrusive nature of the searchholding that when reasonable suspicion exists a school search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the searchholding that the government must prove the defendant knew of the features of the firearm that brought it within the scope of the actholding that the challenged item was within the scope of the search because it reasonably fell within the expressed object of the search even though it turned out to be the defendants personal propertyholding that where defendant consented to search of his car and stood by as agent conducted a thorough and systematic search which included removal of vehicles back seat and raising of cars rear quarter panel defendants failure to object to search indicated search was within scope of consent & \n\nof analysis. If the mistake involved a discretionary act, the appellate court will review for an abuse of discretion. See Widmer, 744 A.2d at 753 (decision whether verdict is against weight of evidence is discretionary). If the mistake concerned an error of law, the court will scrutinize for legal error. See Morrison, 646 A.2d at 571 n. 8 (propriety of jury instructions entails question of law). If there were no mistakes at trial, the appellate court must reverse a decision by the trial court to grant a new trial because the trial court cannot order a new trial where no error of law or abuse of discretion occurred. See Von der Heide v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Transp., 553 Pa. 120, 718 A.2d 286, 290 (1998); Atene, 318 A.2d at 697; Kralik, 258 A.2d at 656; see also Riccio, 705 A.2d at 427 (<HOLDING>).

Dr. Klingenschmitt\u2019s second contention is that the court-martial proceedings were fundamentally unfair because they were tainted by impermissible \u201ccommand influence.\u201d PL\u2019s Mot. 33. Of the several examples of alleged improper command influence set forth in his brief, however, only one \u2014 the allegation that the convening authority of the court-martial, Admiral Ruehe, Commander Navy Religion Mid-Atlantic, was an accuser \u2014 was raised before the court-martial. PL\u2019s Mot. 35 (citing AR 1152-71). The other objections based on allegedly improper command influence were not raised and are therefore waived. See Martinez v. United States, 914 F.2d 1486, 1488 (Fed.Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Dr. Klingenschmitt argues that improper holding that plaintiffs failure to raise his constitutional claims in the military court system bars him from raising them in federal courtholding that where defendant failed to raise defense of plaintiffs fraud in federal court defendant is barred from raising that issue in state courtholding that a defendants failure to object or join in a codefendants objection to an issue bars the defendant from raising the issue on appealholding that failure to raise issue at district court forecloses party from raising same issue on appealholding that the court bars a party from raising an issue on remand that was not raised on appeal & \n\n(Ala.1991). We may not reverse the judgment, based on a jury verdict, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient unless that evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to Mokrzycki, indicates that the verdict was \u201cplainly and palpably wrong and unjust.\u201d Carter v. Henderson, 598 So.2d 1350, 1354 (Ala.1992). \u201cA jury\u2019s award of punitive damages will be considered excessive, as a matter of law, only if: 1) the jury\u2019s decision-making process was tainted by bias, passion, prejudice, or other improper motive; or 2) the verdict goes beyond that necessary to accomplish society\u2019s goals of punishment and deterrence.\u201d Killough v. Jahandarfard, 578 So.2d 1041, 1046 (Ala.1991) (citation omitted). After conducting a hearing under Hammond v. City of Gadsde 436 So.2d 827, 830-31 (Ala.1983) (<HOLDING>); Hutchins v. Shepard, 370 So.2d 275, 276-77 holding that this court will not consider a theory or issue that was not pleaded or raised in the trial courtholding that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this courtholding that as a general rule this court will not consider an issue that was not raised belowholding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that court will not consider issue raised for first time on appeal & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v. Thompson, 710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983))); McRae v. United States, 420 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nmoves into the realm of res judicata.\u201d). The doctrine of issue preclusion \u201ccomes into play when an issue involved in a prior decision is the same issue involved in a subsequent action.\u201d See Mabry v. State Bd. of Community Colleges & Occupational Educ., 813 F.2d 311, 316 (10th Cir.1987). If the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover order, which the debtors did not appeal, \u201cactually and necessarily decided\u201d the exemption issue, principles of issue preclusion could prevent the debtors from raising this argument in an appeal from a subsequent order. See id. (noting that issue preclusion does not apply unless \u201cthe issue is actually decided in the first action\u201d and \u201cit was necessary to decide the issue in disposing of the first action\u201d); see also In re Albrecht, 233 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Turshen v. Chapman, 823 F.2d 836, 839 (4th holding that court lacked jurisdiction on appeal from injunction because the order was simply an interpretation of an earlier orderholding that under the doctrine of direct estoppel a law firms failure to appeal the bankruptcy courts earlier order barred it from challenging the courts holding on its appeal from a subsequent orderholding that an issue not raised on direct appeal of sentence is barred by the law of the case from presentation in a subsequent appealholding that notice indicating appeal was from judgment on date of jury verdict was insufficient to preserve appeal from earlier order granting summary judgmentholding that under the law of the case doctrine an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nhave changed the jury\u2019s decision to impose a death sentence. See Gissendaner, 272 Ga. at 713-714 (10) (b) (reviewing alleged impropriety that was not objected to at trial solely for the purpose of determining if a death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor in violation of OCGA \u00a7 17-10-35 (c) (D). 9. In addition to his claim above regarding unsworn and allegedly false testimony, Martin argues that the trial court erred by permitting victim impact testimony that was improper in other ways. Because Martin failed to both raise objections and obtain rulings on them regarding any of the allegedly objectionable statements, he has forfeited his right to appeal under ordinary appellate review standards. See Smith, 287 Ga. at 30 (3) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, we conclude under the \u201cplain holding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that a party may not raise a claim on appeal that was not presented to the trial courtholding that a party must obtain a distinct ruling on an issue in order to raise it on appealholding that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal & \n\nany mention during cross examination of his dishonorable discharge from the Marines. The court granted defendant's motion. Despite the ruling, the State's attorney asked a question about the circumstances of his leaving the Marines and he replied, \"I deserted.\" State v. Smith, supra at 427. Defendant did not object to the question, did not move to instruct the jury to disregard the answer, and did not move to strike the answer. The Supreme Court held that defendant's motion to exclude the evidence was sufficient to preserve the error for appeal, concluded the error was prejudicial and ordered a new trial. As Smith demonstrates, a ruling on a motion to exclude evidence is not necessarily merely advisory and tentative. Accord, State v. Brooks, 20 Wn. App. 52, 59-60, 579 P.2d 961 (1978) (<HOLDING>) (citing State v. Smith, supra). If such a holding that although a defendant filed a motion in limine on an evidentiary issue a failure to object to the evidence at trial waives the issue for appealholding that a defendants failure to object or join in a codefendants objection to an issue bars the defendant from raising the issue on appealholding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that failure to object does not preclude raising the issue on appeal where erroneous evidence is offered in violation of an order in limine & \n\nany person or the United States from pursuing any other remedy, civil or criminal, which may be available for the vindication or enforcement of any law prohibiting discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, national origin or economic status in the selection of persons for service on grand or petit juries. The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits read \u00a7 1867 to mean a defendant pursing a constitutional challenge to a jury pool need not comply with its provisions. See United States v. De Alba-Conrado, 481 F.2d 1266, 1270 n. 5 (5th Cir.1973) (citing the plain language of the statute and the legislative history in holding the procedures set forth in the Act are not applicable to constitutional challenges to a jury venire); United States v. Jones, 687 F.2d 1265, 1269 (8th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). The Eleventh Circuit, meanwhile, applies \u00a7 holding failure to comply with 851b was harmless error in part because defendant did not comply with 851c procedures for challenging prior convictionsholding the failure to comply with the act does not bar defendant from raising a constitutional challenge to jury selection proceduresholding that plaintiffs failure to exhaust available grievance procedures does not bar her title vii claimsholding that failure to include an issue in statement of issues did not bar the appellant from raising the issue in its opening briefholding that the failure to file a proper motion to dismiss raising a constitutional challenge to a criminal statute waives the issue on appeal & \n\nthe judgment and sentence \u2018set[s] forth the statutory maximum and clearly indicated] that the term of community [custody] does not extend the total sentence beyond that maximum.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 566 (emphasis added) (alterations in original) (quoting State v. Hibdon, 140 Wn. App. 534, 538, 166 P.3d 826 (2007)). While the court did not address Zavala-Reynoso, it did rely in part on Sloan to conclude that a remand to the trial court for clarification was the proper remedy. Torngren, 147 Wn. App. at 566. Although the Torngren court found that an amended sentence was the appropriate remedy in that case, Division Three has also indicated that either an amended sentence or a vacation and remand for resentencing are equally appropriate remedies in these circumstances. Hibdon, 140 Wn. App. at 538 (<HOLDING>). Does the sentence exceed the statutory holding that a remand need not be ordered despite legal errors if remand would be futileholding remand order reviewable because crowded docket not ground for remand under 1447cholding that in addition to a remand for clarification another option in these circumstances is to remand for resentencingholding that on direct appeal appellate court may remand for resentencing of all countsholding that the fourth circuit has jurisdiction to review a district courts sua sponte remand order even when that remand order is styled as a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction if the order was in fact based on the procedural insufficiency of the notice of removal & \n\nremedy is itself unconstitutional; that under Booker we should review his sentence for reasonableness; and that his sentence is unreasonable. United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reviewed Spielvogel\u2019s sentence in Spielvogel II and Spielvogel III, however, and he presented none of these arguments in those appeals. We explicitly said in Spielvogel III that \u201cSpielvogel has abandoned his Apprendi\/Blakely\/Booker issue.\u201d No. 03-13135, slip op. at 4. Nothing in the \u00a7 2255 court\u2019s order requires that we revisit a sentence we affirmed in Spielvogel II and Spielvogel III, and the sentence before us is the same sentence. These arguments are also barred by the law of the case. See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, 110 F.3d 1556, 1560-61 (11th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). Spielvogel\u2019s convictions and sentences are holding an issue not raised in the bankruptcy court was waived on appealholding that an issue not raised on direct appeal of sentence is barred by the law of the case from presentation in a subsequent appealholding that under the law of the case doctrine an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appealholding that under the doctrine of direct estoppel a law firms failure to appeal the bankruptcy courts earlier order barred it from challenging the courts holding on its appeal from a subsequent orderholding that an issue not raised on appeal is waived & \n\n\u201cregardless of whether the respondent has been tried, acquitted, or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense.\u201d This language makes it clear that a disciplinary violation premised on a violation of law is separate from the initiation or outcome of criminal proceedings based on the same conduct. Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla. Bar v. Brown, 905 So.2d 76, 81 (Fla.2005); see also Fla. Bar v. Riggs, 944 So.2d 167, 171 (Fla.2006) (<HOLDING>); Fla. Bar v. Barley, 881 So.2d 163, 169 holding that attorneys engaging in conduct involving dishonesty amounts to conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice lawholding intent as an element for disciplining an attorney for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentation is proven by establishing that the conduct was deliberate or knowingholding that an infamous crime under the arkansas constitution is a crime involving elements of deceit and dishonestyholding that reliance is not an element to be proven under securities fraud in indianaholding that in the context of federal immigration law the amount of loss to the victim of fraud or deceit does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit but rather refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed fraud or deceit & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\nwith the meaning of the word \u2018appeal\u2019 in the context of [Article] VI, Section 27.\u201d Hicks, 105 N.M. at 287, 731 P.2d at 983. {23} In Hicks, this Court held that, because criminal actions in metropolitan court were not of record at that time, \u201cthe right of appeal in such actions is the right to a trial or hearing de novo in the district court[, and] [i]n de novo proceedings, the district court is not in any way bound by the proceedings in the lower court.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). We held that the district court was required to independently determine whether the requirements of the metropolitan court were complied with and thus remanded the case to district court to make such a determination. Id. Compare State v. Spillman, 2010-NMCA-019, \u00b6 6, 147 N.M. 676, 227 P.3d 1058 (filed 2009) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, holding that where a defendant fails to challenge his plea in district court he must establish plain errorholding that before a defendant could contest the validity of a plea entered in metropolitan court by appealing to district court he had to first move to set aside his plea in metropolitan court because in an ontherecord appeal to district court that court is the equivalent of an appellate courtholding that the district court had jurisdiction to order restitution of award overturned on appeal even in the absence of a remand from the appellate courtholding that because a claim was never raised in the district court this court would not consider it for the first time on appealholding that if the defendant fails to file a motion in the trial court to withdraw his plea he cannot attack it for the first time on appeal & \n\nthe warrant. Rather, according to the trial court, the express terms of the warrant \"through inadvertence\u201d did not permit as extensive a search as was actually conducted. Thus, it appears the actual basis for the trial court's ruling was that the search exceeded the scope of a valid warrant. 3 . We do not here address the question of whether an appellee may raise an argument in defense of the lower court\u2019s judgment when that argument was not presented in the lower court. We do note, however, that our previous opinions on that question have been somewhat inconsistent. See, e.g., Buehner Block Co. v. UWC Assocs., 752 P.2d 892, 894-95 (Utah 1988) (applying argument raised for first time on appeal to affirm lower court\u2019s decision); American Coal Co. v. Sandstrom, 689 P.2d 1, 4 (Utah 1984) (<HOLDING>); L & M Corp. v. Loader, 688 P.2d 448, 449-50 holding that 1252d1 bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below and of general issues that were not raised below but not of specific subsidiary legal arguments or arguments by extension that were not made belowholding that arguments not raised below are waived for appealholding that petitioners had abandoned arguments not raised belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding that an issue not properly preserved below in the district court is generally waived & \n\nbankruptcy court record, including the consolidated pre-trial order, the McFarlands\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and their post-trial, brief, shows that the McFarlands did not present the constructive trust arguments they raise on appeal to the bankruptcy court for resolution. (See Bankr. Dkt. Entries 43, 53, & 76). Nor did they make these arguments in their brief on appeal to. the district court. (See Dist. Dkt. Entry 6). Rather, they asserted throughout the underlying proceedings only that a resulting trust was established. Therefore, the McFarlands cannot now complain that the bankruptcy court failed to address whether a constructive trust was established, and we decline to consider these arguments for the first time on appeal. See In re Egidi, 571 F.3d at 1163 (<HOLDING>). In any case, the McFarlands\u2019 arguments do not holding that an argument not raised before the bankruptcy court will not be considered for the first time on appealholding that court will not consider issue raised for first time on appealholding that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this courtholding that an argument raised for the first time in response to defendants motion to dismiss instead of in an amended complaint was not properly raised before the district court and would not be considered on appealholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered & \n\nby a plausible basis in the record. Secretary\u2019s Br. at 7-8. Furthermore, the Secretary argues that a remand for readjudication in light of the enactment of the VCAA is not required because \u201cthe record fails to reveal the necessity for additional development ... [and the a]ppellant has been given adequate notice which detailed the law and evidence necessary to establish his claim.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Br. at 10. In his reply, the appellant argues that the BVA decision should be vacated and the matters remanded because of \u201cthe Board\u2019s failure to make a finding on the question of whether the VCAA applies.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply at 1. Initially, the Court notes that it will address only those arguments adequately raised by the appellant in his briefs. See Ford v. Gober, 10 Vet.App. 531, 535-36 (1997) (<HOLDING>); Grivois v.

In Dep\u2019t of Navy, this court held that collective bargaining was in the public interest, and the union, as the chosen bargaining representative, was the party specifically designated by Congress to further that public interest. In this case, by contrast, Congress has authorized the contracting federal agency and the Department of Labor to safeguard the public interest embodied in the Davis-Bacon Act by giving them the power to enforce the statute. Although we do not decide the issue, it is likely that the Union has no private cause of action against the employer for Davis-Bacon Act violations. Cf. Weber v.

In rejecting Scott\u2019s claim of constructive discharge and accepting Harris\u2019s claim of resignation, the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that a salary in the reduced amount of $150,000 could not be deemed so abusive as to render continued employment untenable.

Obviously, then, Plaintiff was aware of the facts giving rise to this cause of action by May 17th at the latest. The present Complaint, however, was filed on August 9, 2004, well over two years after that date.

O). Plaintiffs have not contested that Co-plaintiff Plesha signed off on August of 2001 when the voyage concluded (Docket #42 SUF No. 34). It follows that Defendants\u2019 payment of unearned wages until August of 2001 complied with the terms and conditions of the Seafarer\u2019s Agreement signed by Co-plaintiff Plesha.

The Complaint here fails to state a cause of action. Although attorney honesty and fidelity are vital to the legal system and a matter in the public interest, we do not believe that a former law firm employee can be immune from the general rule of at-will employment merely by complaining to the Firm and its attorneys prior to being fired about deceitful but seemingly legal billing practices he no longer wishes to participate in. While we do not condone the Firm\u2019s alleged misconduct here, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs allegation of \u201chonesty and fidelity\u201d in the legal system satisfies the supreme court\u2019s \u201cnarrow definition of public policy\u201d in retaliatory discharge cases. Id. at 507-08 (<HOLDING>). We affirm the dismissal of the Complaint. holding that based on the narrow scope of a retaliatory discharge action the general concept of patient safety by itself is simply inadequate to justify finding an exception to the general rule of atwill employmentholding that an atwill employee who alleges retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers compensation claim has stated a cause of action under pennsylvania lawrecognizing the tort of retaliatory dischargerecognizing general rulerecognizing narrow whistleblower exception to the atwill doctrine & \n\nto establish a necessary element of the crime: the existence of a single scheme involving theft of $5,000 worth of property from the water department. The standard of review for a claim of insufficient evidence is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d United States v. Ellzey, 874 F.2d 324, 328 (6th Cir.1989) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). There is ample support for allowing the government to aggregate several acts to establish the $5,000 threshold required for prosecution where the multiple conversions are part of a single scheme. See, e.g., Sanderson, 966 F.2d at 189 (<HOLDING>). The district court instructed the jury in holding that for the government to be sued on a contract pursuant to the tucker act there must be privity of contract between the plaintiff and the united statesholding that when one steals paint and supplies and then orders employees to use such materials in private contract work both actions will be considered components of the larger single fraudulent act of theft from the local governmentholding in a breach of contract action that a state statute established that employees have a right to rely on the layoff and termination procedures advanced by their employers and that to the extent that the government employer considered factors in addition to seniority ability and merit the countys termination of the plaintiffs employment was in violation of the county personnel management actholding that a change in employer from one federal contractor to another caused employees no lack of workholding that orders remanding an action to a federal agency are generally not considered final appealable orders & \n\nin the equipment; (4) Segundo did not assist Monson in retrieving the equipment from law enforcement; and (5) Segundo did not adequately protect its collateral. But these excuses do not make Monson\u2019s own conduct any less willful or malicious. The collapse of the business did not relieve Monson of the contractual obligations which he entered into or give him carte blanche to make off with equipment he bought with someone else\u2019s money. Demonstrably, Monson knew his actions were wrongful and without just cause. Further, Monson\u2019s behavior falls outside of the sort of reckless or unfortunate but non-malicious acts that this Court have previously held do not rise to the standard of a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

Considering these factors, we conclude that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was not tainted by the illegal protective sweep of his home. To be sure, Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was obtained minutes after the illegal protective sweep was completed. And we recognize that the fact that Mr. Scott was apprised of his right to refuse the search does not constitute an intervening factor sufficient to dissipate the taint of the illegal sweep. Id. at 678 (<HOLDING>). However, the officers\u2019 conduct in this case, recognizing that unconstitutionally obtained evidence can become so attenuated as to dissipate the taintholding that the reading of miranda warnings and the signing of a waiver of fourth and fifth amendment rights are not sufficient intervening factors sufficient to dissipate the taint of an unlawful entry into a homeholding that consent to search did not purge the taint of an unlawful detention when no intervening circumstances sufficiently separated the consent from the unlawful detentionholding that because miranda warnings make defendant aware of right to counsel and of consequences of waiving sixth amendment rights defendants waiver of right to counsel after receiving such warnings is validholding that although defendant was a deputy sheriff miranda warnings were required irrespective of defendants knowledge of his fifth amendment rights & \n\ninstead, the dispute is whether the consent was voluntary. ANALYSIS The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that it is \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in then-persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable seizures ... and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d U.S. Const, amend.

But, when the officer approached the defendant\u2019s car, he saw a temporary registration sticker in the window. At that point, the officer\u2019s reason for the stop evaporated. Id. Nevertheless, the officer proceeded to ask the defendant for his driver\u2019s license and proof of registration. The defendant\u2019s responses to those requests led to the discovery of evidence that the defendant\u2019s license was suspended and he was driving uninsured. The Supreme Court held that, once the reason for the stop evaporated, the officer did not have authority to ask the defendant for his license and registration, and the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence resulting from those requests. Id. at 94; see also State v. Bentz, 211 Or App 129, 134, 158 P3d 1081 (2007) (<HOLDING>). As Starr and Farley show, an illegal stop holding that defendants voluntary consent to search his car dissipated taint of officers illegal entryholding that officers request for defendants name during an illegal entry constituted exploitation of the illegal entry under hallrecognizing difference in elements between offense of actual entry and attempted entryholding in an impliedconsent case that a warrantless police entry was unlawful in part because the police did not request entryholding that a confession obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest is not admissible & \n\nfor purposes of placing surveillance equipment. The only jurisdictional limitation the government acknowledges is that the listening post must be located in the issuing court\u2019s jurisdiction. Of course, the statute does not refer to a \u201clistening post,\u201d and none of the cases cited by the government addresses the jurisdiction of the issuing court to authorize law enforcement officers to covertly place a listening device on private property. All of those cases addressed phone taps, and as the Seventh Circuit explained, \u201ca tap is not placed in the telephone handset itself; it is attached to the telephone line at some distance from the handset.\u201d United States v.

United States, holding that although search of passenger compartment was legal search of trunk was notholding that a wiretap was not a search because tjhere was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendantsholding that no jury could reasonably fail to find that it was objectively reasonable for the officers to take the actions they did when the only invasion of privacy that occurred was entry and an emergency sweep a search of the premises was not conducted until the magistrate informed of what the officers had learned on the scene prior to entry explicitly authorized a search of the third householding that the defendants entry into the foyer of a fraternity house was an entry into a dwellingholding that search of backpack constituted a search of defendants person and was not authorized by search warrant for premises & \n\nwhich is to be determined from the totality of all of the circumstances. Id. at 248-49, 93 S.Ct. 2041. The voluntariness of a consent to search should be evaluated in much the same fashion as the voluntariness of a confession. Washington, 653 So.2d at 364 (\u201cAlthough a warrantless search is per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the search will be considered lawful if conducted pursuant to consent which was given voluntarily and freely.\u201d (citing Norman v.

In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him. This search revealed that Wilke degree of force is necessary, gratuitous acts against a person who has been seized might violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. Phelps v.

Even if the Enforcement Division\u2019s individual investigatory files contained responsive records, NIGC asserts that those files are law enforcement documents which, in the absence of a waiver, are exempt under FOIA Exemption 7(C) because their disclosure \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C); see Melius v.

Thus, to discuss the issue here, it is necessary to use that investigative detention\/custody framework. Nevertheless, the use of the term investigative detention when discussing the Fifth Amendment should be interpreted as a non-custodial encounter under Miranda rather than a Fourth Amendment stop under Terry. 27 . See United States v. Knox, 839 F.2d 285, 296 (6th Cir.1988) (Jones, J., concurring) (concluding \"since a valid Terry seizure is, by definition, not a \u2018full seizure\u2019 \u2014 a term synonymous with \u2018arrest\u2019 \u2014 a person properly seized on reasonable and articulable suspicion for a brief investigatory detention could never be considered \u2018in custody\u2019 so long as the scope and duration of the Terry stop do not exceed h Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). 29 . If custody and investigative detention holding defendant was in custody under miranda while being detained under terryholding police officer knew that miranda rights are required to be given only to individuals who are in custody and although giving miranda warnings to a detainee may not automatically convert a terry stop into an arrest it is evidence that the nature of the detention has grown more seriousholding a defendant was not in custody for purposes of miranda after he consented to go to police headquartersholding miranda inapplicable because defendant not in custodyholding that defendant was not in miranda custody during knock and talk interview at his residence & \n\nargues that the trial court erred in denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim because under these facts the search could not be justified as a search incident to arrest where the police had a preplanned intention to arrest him and search the car for investigation of other crimes. He also contends that the search was illegal because the items removed from the car (videotapes, computer disks, and a briefcase) were taken to a remote site (the police department) and \u201csearched\u201d at a later time. Pugh is entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his postconviction claims unless (1) the motion, files, and records in the case conclusively show that he is entitled to no relief, or (2) the motion or a particular claim is legally insufficient nt v.

To hold differently would be to narrow the scope of a search of one\u2019s person to a point at which it would have little meaning. Id. Several other jurisdictions have similarly concluded that the search of a person includes containers held by the person. See United, States v.

See Edwards, 178 F.3d at 241 n. 6. Next, the Joneses dispute the district court\u2019s dismissal of their third claim, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), as adopted by Virginia, which they based on Defendant\u2019s alleged breaches of contract discussed supra. The Joneses\u2019 claim fails as a matter of law for two reasons. First, the UCC does not apply to transfers of real property. Greenwood Assocs., Inc. v. Crestar Bank, 248 Va. 265, 448 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1994). Second, even if the deed of trust falls under the UCC as the Joneses argue, their claim fails because it was pled as a separate tort claim. See Charles E. Brauer Co. v. NationsBank of Va. N.A., 251 Va. 28, 466 S.E.2d 382, 385 (1996) (<HOLDING>). Finally, the Joneses contend that the holding that where the conduct forming the basis of the plaintiffs breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing claim is the same conduct forming the basis for the breach of contract claim the claims merge and there is no separate cause of action for breach of duty of good faith and fair dealingholding that a cause of action for breach of contract accrues at the time of the breachholding that the failure to act in good faith does not amount to an independent tort the breach of the implied duty under the ucc gives rise only to a cause of action for breach of contractrecognizing that breach of contract cause of action accrues at time of the breachholding that breach of good faith and fair dealing claim requires showing of breach of contract & \n\nfor breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by Amtrak because it has failed to plead a valid contract. While Virginia law recognizes a contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing, Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Company-Connecticut, 156 F.3d 535, 542 (4th Cir.1998), a breach of that duty only creates a claim for breach of contract. Joyce v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., 845 F.Supp. 353, 355 (E.D.Va.1993) (stating that there is no independent cause of action for breach of implied covenant). Where, as here, there is no allegation of a valid contract betwee ence with prospective business advantage fails because Plaintiff has not alleged the existence of a valid business expectancy. Krantz v. Air Line Pilots Assoc., 245 Va. 202, 205-06, 427 S.E.2d 326 (1993) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiff admits in its Amended Complaint holding that with respect to tortious interference recognized standards of business ethics and business customs and practices are pertinentrecognizing the tort of interference with prospective contractual relations as a subspecies of the broader tort of interference with prospective economic advantageholding that the first element in a prima facie case of tortious interference with prospective business advantage is the existence of business expectancyholding that the first element in a prima facie case of tortious interference with contract is the existence of a valid contractual relationshiprecognizing action for tortious interference with prospective advantage & \n\ndefense of misrepresentation on the policy application is not proper; he had fully cooperated and satisfied all conditions of the i a-contractual claims was improper because: (1) he needed to conduct additional discovery regarding the reasonableness of the denial; and (2) the issue of whether Farmers breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing was a fact issue. In this case, Farmers had a reasonable basis for denying the claim based on Perrotta\u2019s own breach of the policy. See Betco Scaffolds Co., 29 S.W.3d at 348. As such, Farmers did not breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing to Perrotta with regard to that denial, and Perrotta\u2019s extra-contractual claims fail as a matter of law. See United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Williams, 955 S.W.2d 267, 268 (Tex.1997) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we affirm summary judgment for holding title company liable for bad faithholding that bad faith includes lack of good faith in investigating the facts of a complaintholding insurer not liable for bad faith when it denied insureds claim based on a good faith dispute regarding the interpretation of a ruleholding there can be no claim for bad faith when an insurer has promptly denied a claim that is in fact not coveredholding that a bad faith claim is a tort & \n\nwas reasonable, it believes that plaintiffs have met the Tenth Circuit\u2019s modified interpretation of the \u201clikelihood of success\u201d requirement.

Moreover, the court believes that if plaintiffs ultimately prevail on a theory of promissory estoppel, the covenant would be enforceable to the extent that it protects any legitimate business interest beyond mere competition. See Eastern Distrib. Co., Inc. v. Flynn, 222 Kan. 666, 567 P.2d 1371 (1977) (<HOLDING>). The court concludes from the record before it holding that the restraint of a covenant not to compete must be reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that only a legitimate business interest may be protected by the covenantholding employment agreement consisting entirely of a covenant not to compete unenforceable because the covenant must be supported by valuable considerationholding that michigan courts would not enforce a covenant not to compete which violates mcla 445761 even though the covenant would have been enforceable in missouri where the contract was executedholding that a covenant not to compete for two years was enforceableholding that in the employment context cause of action seeking tort remedies for breach of implied covenant is not permitted recovery for breach of this covenant is limited to contract remedies & \n\nsee also Johnson v. City of Fort Wayne, 91 F.3d 922, 943 (7th Cir.1996) (noting that a property interest may arise from an express or implied contract, as well as a state statute or regulation). The plaintiffs assert that defendants deprived them of a property interest in an expected degree from an accredited state institution. Illinois courts have not identified clearly a property right in post-secondary education. However, Illinois courts have found that the payment of tuition to an educational institution ordinarily gives rise to an implied contract that the school will award a degree upon the student\u2019s satisfaction of the degree requirements established by the school. See Johnson v. Lincoln Christian Coll., 150 Ill.App.3d 733, 103 Ill.Dec. 842, 501 N.E.2d 1380, 1384 (1986) (<HOLDING>); Wilson v.

Id. 20. In the private sector, standards of reasonableness are commonly applied or implied which take into account the facts and the circumstances. See, e.g., NMSA 1978, \u00a7 55-1-102(3) (1961) (stating that under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201cparties may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of such obligations is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable\u201d); Watson Truck & Supply Co. v. Males, 111 N.M. 57, 60, 801 P.2d 639, 642 (1990) (every contract imposes upon parties a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and enforcement); Boss Barbara, Inc. v.

This statutory provision, together with the structurally inclusive nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, creates a relationship of trust and reliance between injured employees and workers\u2019 compensation insurers. I would hold, as have several other courts, that this relationship places a tort-based duty on insurers to deal in good faith with injured employees. See Savio, 706 P.2d at 1272-74 (nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, combined with section of workers\u2019 compensation statute requiring that insurance policies contain clause making insurer primarily liable to employee, creates tort duty on part of insurer to deal in good faith with employee); see also Case v.

For this reason, I am satisfied \u00a7 301 preempts the breach of contract claims because \u201cat the very least,\u201d this court \u201cwould be required to interpret the CBA to determine whether it was intended to be the sole agreement between the parties.\u201d DiGiantommaso v.

A party may recover damages in equity if there exists a contract implied in law, see Paschall's, 407 S.W.2d at 153; however, equitable relief is not available if there exists a contract implied in fact. See Ridgelake v. Harpeth Valley Utilities Dist. of Davidson and Williamson Counties, 2005 WL 831594, at *8 (Tenn.Ct.App.2005) (<HOLDING>); see also, Daugherty v. Sony Elecs., Inc., holding that at will contracts of employment are subject to tortious interference with contracts claimsholding that ajctions brought upon theories of unjust enrichment quasi contract contracts implied in law and quantum meruit are essentially the same courts frequently employ the various terminology interchangeably to describe that class of implied obligations where on the basis of justice and equity the law will impose a contractual relationship between parties regardless of their assent theretoholding implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing found in some commercial contracts does not extend to atwill employment contractsholding he who seeks equity must do equity holding only contracts implied in law are creatures of equity & \n\nhis position as an \u201cex-post facto attempt to add additional terms to the Forbearance Agreement.\u201d Instead, Saverin asserts, he is alleging that Wendy\u2019s bad-faith actions breached the existing terms of the Forbearance Agreement. Specifically, he posits that the very purpose of the Forbearance Agreement was frustrated when Wendy\u2019s failed to prevent the occurrence of a condition \u2014 the appointment of a receiver \u2014 that permitted Wendy\u2019s to prematurely terminate the Forbearance and Franchise Agreements. But this reasoning ignores the principle that the implied duty of good faith cannot be breached by acting as allowed by the specific terms of the contract. Ed Schory & Sons, 662 N.E.2d at 1083; see also Jim White Agency Co. v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., 126 F.3d 832, 834-35 (6th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). Simply put, Saverin admits that Wendy\u2019s did holding that franchisor not only has valid interest in protecting good will it has developed but it also has an interest in being able to place a new franchisee at or near the same location where its goodwill has been createdholding that a common law breach of contract action will lie for the insurers failure to comply with its obligation to act in good faith and with due care in representing the interests of the insured in its failure to settle with a third partyholding that a lending institution does not violate a separate duty of good faith by adhering to its agreements with a borrower or enforcing its contractual rights as a creditorholding that franchisor has an interest in the goodwill its franchise has createdholding in a case decided under ohio law that a franchisor cannot be found liable for failure to act in good faith where it has done no more than to insist on enforcing its contract rights to the detriment of its franchisee & \n\nfor sum mary judgment that the plaintiff does not have a vested right or property interest in the position of municipal judge. Although in his Original Petition the plaintiff alleges in a conclusory fashion that he was a public employee working pursuant to a contract of employment, the plaintiff fails to allege any facts to indicate that a contract of employment existed and further fails to provide any competent summary judgment evidence to support this allegation. The City of Was-kom\u2019s ordinance provides that the term of office of the municipal judge shall be by appointment of the City Council by a majority vote of the governing body. The City\u2019s ordinance does not appear to create a contract of employment. See Youngblood v. City of Galveston, 920 F.Supp. 10B (S.D.Tex. 1996) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiff does not even allege that the holding that plaintiff did not have dueprocessprotected property interest because he failed to sufficiently plead a rule or other mutually explicit understanding from the manual or otherwise bridling the reason for which he could be terminated and thereby creating a sufficient expectation of continued employment the critical component herewithout alleging such a bridle plaintiff was an atwill employee consequently he lacked a property interest in his continued employmentholding that former municipal judge did not have property interest in continued employmentholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that property interest in continued expectation of public employment does not include right to actually occupy positionholding an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was insufficient to create a property interest in continued employment under montanas statutory scheme for at will employment & \n\nso accommodating. See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a) (\u201c... the trustee, with the court\u2019s approval, may employ ...\u201d); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b) (\u201cThe trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease ... \u201d); and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a) (\u201c... the trustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume or reject ... \u201d). As a consequence, courts have been left in these many instances to figure out for themselves what they are to consider. Their response, though, has frequently been limited to only the adoption of some vague standard that in turn is exemplified by some equally vague phrase. Take, for example, the different measures that courts have offered in connection with Section 363(b) sales. Section 363(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code governs the present dispute and provides (Bankr.D.Del.1987) (<HOLDING>); In re Charlesbank Laundry Co., 37 B.R. 20, 22 holding that the duty of good faith and fair dealing is a contractual dutyholding that duty of good faith and fair dealing did not extend to thirdparty claimantholding that benefiting fiduciary must show he acted in good faith and that transactions were fair and equitableholding that a sale must be both fair and reasonable in price and made in good faithholding that the transaction must be fair and equitable and in good faith & \n\nlimestone on right of way); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 158 (1965) (defining trespass as unauthorized entry by \u201cthing\u201d or person); W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts \u00a7 13 at 70 (5th ed.1984) (same). When such a tangible invasion occurred, the element of damages was presumed. Longenecker v. Zimmerman, 175 Kan. 719, 721, 267 P.2d 543, 545 (Kan.1954). As the bankruptcy and district courts noted, however, some courts have adopted a \u201cmodern\u201d view of trespass that recognizes intangible invasions. See, e.g., Public Service Co. of Colo. v. Van Wyk, 27 P.3d 377, 390 (Colo.2001) (\u201c[W]e now hold that, in Colorado, an intangible intrusion may give rise to claim for trespass.... \u201d); Bradley v. Am.

The jury found that \u201cLabCorp breached the license agreement by terminating it\u201d for the Abbott test. LabCorp contends that it did not formally terminate the contract, because the contract requires that the licensee provide written notice. The record contains no evidence of a written termination. The record does show, however, that LabCorp stopped paying royalties on the total homocysteine tests. Refusal to pay royalties is a material breach of the license. See Dow Chem. Co. v.

We overrule Faucette and Schadler\u2019s first issue. Damages for Breach of Option Contract In their second issue, Faucette and Schadler contend that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to prove damages for breach of contract. They argue that Grace was awarded what she would have received from the sale of the remaining shares of Sarco without any evidence of the value of the shares she should have surrendered in the transaction. According to Faucette and Schadler, proper proof of damages required not only evidence of the amount Grace would have received had the sale of the shares been performed, but also evidence of the value of the shares she would have surrendered in the transaction.

Federal law on bifurcation for bad faith claims against insurers does not support Arrowood\u2019s argument for separate trials. Federal courts sometimes bifurcate trials of underlying liability claims and bad faith claims, but only when the liability claims are still unresolved. See, e.g., Warren v. Federal Ins. Co., 358 Fed.Appx. 670, 676 (6th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). There is no pending contract claim here.

The D.C. Court of Appeals has not squarely addressed the question whether bad faith denial of an insurance claim constitutes an independent tort under D.C. law. The district court has considered the issue in two separate reported cases, but these cases are directly in conflict. Compare GEICO, 769 F.Supp. at 387 (\u201cDistrict of Columbia law does not recognize the tort of bad faith denial' of an insurance claim.\u201d) with Washington v. Group Hospitalization, Inc., 585 F.Supp. 517, 520 (D.D.C.1984) (<HOLDING>).

Counterclaim 4 simply recites the elements of a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations . without alleging facts to support this claim. Importantly, it fails to identify the business relationships and third parties to those relationships on which the claim is based. It fails to set forth any facts regarding the \u201cimproper, deceptive, illegal or fraudulent conduct\u201d in which Plaintiff and Counter-Defendants engaged. Such conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim. See Advanced Global Tech. LLC v. Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc., 15 Misc.3d 776, 836 N.Y.S.2d 807, 812 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2007) (<HOLDING>).

State Farm was justified in informing insureds of this policy limitation and in suggesting alternative vendors whose charge would be fully covered under the policy. See Minn.Stat. \u00a7 72A.201, subd. 4(5) (making it an unfair claims practice to fail to notify an insured of all available benefits which the insured may be eligible to receive); see also DeBonaventura v.

Nor can we say that Aidco\u2019s actions were targeted to have an effect in Iowa. See Calder, 465 U.S. at 789, 104 S.Ct. at 1487. When a business seeks to promote its products and solicit the customers of its competitors, it necessarily wishes to have customers believe that its products are superior and to place its competitor\u2019s products in a less favorable light. Although this promotion and solicitation may have an effect on a competitor, absent additional contacts, this effect alone will not be sufficient to bestow personal jurisdiction. We do not mean to imply that we approve or disapprove of Aidco\u2019s actions, only to point out that the holding of Calder cannot be read as broadly as Hicklin wishes. See also Keystone Publishers Serv., Inc. v. Ross, 747 F.2d 1233, 1234 (8th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>).

The Court need not resolve this difficult question, however, because it determines below that the plaintiff has stated a colorable state law claim against Pacheco for interference with contractual relations. 2. Interference with Contractual Relations Genlyte argues that the claim against Pacheco for tortious interference with contractual relations is preempted by c. 151B. The weight of authority holds otherwise. While c. 151B\u2019s remedial scheme preempts all other state statutory causes of action, see, e.g., Green v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 422 Mass. 551, 557-558, 664 N.E.2d 808, 813 (1996) (<HOLDING>), an employee is not foreclosed, under holding a pleading will not be sufficient to state a claim under the civil rights act if the allegations are mere conclusionsholding that civil rights claims under 42 usc 1981 and 1982 are personal injury tort claimsholding that c 151b precludes claims under mass gen l c 214 1c civil rights act and equal rights actholding that damages based on the abstract value of constitutional rights are not a permissible element of compensatory damages in action under civil rights act of 1871holding that 16 of the urban mass transit act 1656 of the federalaid highway act and other acts created no substantive rights sufficient to invoke 1983 & \n\nto reject the claim, noting that it fails not on the evidence but on the law. The requirements of activity beyond the scope of employment, malice, and personal gain invoked by Cohen are referenced out of context. That heightened standard applies when a corporate officer is accused of tortiously interfering with, or inducing the breach of, a contract between that officer\u2019s employer corporation and a third party. See, e.g., Maillet v. Frontpoint Partners, L.L.C., No. 02 Civ. 7865(GBD), 2003 WL 21355218, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 10, 2003) (\u201cUnder ...

It is well established that a general denial of allegations of corporate capacity or existence fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 55.13. See id. (<HOLDING>); Student Loan Mkt. Ass\u2019n v. Holloway, 25 holding that appeal from denial of rule 60b motion raised for review only the district courts order of denial and not the underlying judgment itselfholding bare allegation of social friendship insufficientholding that making a nonfrivolous allegation is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdictionholding that a mere allegation of fraud is insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to the pslraholding that a denial of each and every allegation is insufficient under rule 5513 & \n\nis subjected to the heightened pleading standard of Iqbal and Twombly \u201d). Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

Yet these types of uses can be- and are statutorily required to be-limited to amounts \"reasonable and appropriate under reasonably efficient practices to accomplish without waste the purpose for which the appropriation is lawfully made.\" \u00a7 37-92-103(4). Water courts are well equipped to determine what amount of water is reasonable for recreational uses. See Colo. Water Conservation Bd. v. Upper Gunnison River Water Conservancy Dist., 109 P.3d 585, 602-08 (Colo.2005) (<HOLDING>). As with RICDs, expert testimony can establish holding that article x 2 of the california constitution dictates the basic principles defining water rights that no one can have a protectible interest in the unreasonable use of water and that holders of water rights must use water reasonably and beneficiallyholding that the recreational inchannel diversion ricd statute requires water courts to determine the amount of water necessary for a reasonable recreation experienceholding that mandamus was appropriate to require the director to deliver the full decreed water rights of a water right holderholding substantial completion had occurred because water district took possession of all the lines filled them with water and began using them to serve the customers of the water districtholding that village could not condition provision of water services on annexation where prospective customer was within a rural water associations service area and the water association was federally indebted & \n\nor discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan, this subchapter, section 1201 of this title, or the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.], or for the purpose of interfering with the attainment of any right to which such participant may become entitled under the plan, this sub- chapter, or the Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act.... 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1140 (emphasis added).

For example, when a participant or assignee argues that,' with respect to a particular claim for payment, the claims administrator (or some affiliate thereof) \u201cinterfered\u201d with payment under the plan by unfairly denying the claim, courts have found that the interference claim is preempted.

Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim.

The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy.

Although the danger of prejudice associated with prior conviction evidence is often great, the district court in this case substantially reduced the possibility of prejudice to Bonner by carefully instructing the jury on how they could consider the evidence.

The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter.

Ontiveros\u2019s conviction must therefore be reversed. CONCLUSION \u00b6 20 We reverse Ontiveros\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial. Because of this disposition, we do not reach the sentencing issue raised by Ontiveros. CONCURRING: G. MURRAY SNOW, Presiding Judge and DONN KESSLER, Judge. 1 . The offense of attempted second-degree murder under \u00a7\u00a7 13-1001(A)(2) and -1104(A)(2) does not, contrary to Ontiveros\u2019s argument, require an intent to cause death. The culpable mental state of knowingly causing the death of another is sufficient under \u00a7 13-1104(A)(2). Cf. State v. Nunez, 159 Ariz. 594, 769 P.2d 1040 (App.1989) (<HOLDING>). The requirement of acting knowingly, however, holding that conspiracy to commit murder is not lesserincluded offense of firstdegree murderholding that fetus was not a human being for purposes of attempted firstdegree intentional homicide and firstdegree reckless injury statutesholding that a jury could not be instructed that attempted murder can be committed knowinglyholding that attempted firstdegree murder may be committed knowingly or intentionallyholding that appellate counsel was ineffective in failing to argue based on the first districts decision in montgomery that the standard attempted manslaughterbyact instruction was fundamentally erroneous where betts was charged with attempted firstdegree premeditated murder and convicted of the necessary lesserincluded offense of attempted seconddegree murder & \n\ndissenting. I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s reversal of Carter\u2019s attempted murder conviction. While I agree that the instruction at issue here was erroneous and that Carter\u2019s appellate counsel was deficient for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal, I conclude that Carter has failed to demonstrate prejudice. As a result, I would affirm the post-conviction courts denial of Carter\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. If deficient performance by appellate counsel is found, we turn to the prejudice prong to determine whether the issues appellate counsel failed to raise would have been clearly more likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.

(11) In determining the need for osteopathic and allopathic beds in a given area, it is the generally accepted practice of health planning experts to consider such factors as historical, current and projected utilization or occupancy rates of existing acute care beds, the average of length of patient stays, and the admission rates of physicians (<HOLDING>).

See id.; Coates v. State, 534 N.E.2d 1087, 1093 (Ind.1989). Trial counsel was under no obligation to tender an instruction regarding the voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s statements, and the trial court would not have been obligated to present such an instruction to the jury.

Here, the Debtor seeks to do exactly that under the Plan. Wells Fargo has objected to the Plan and argues that it impermissi-bly modifies Wells Fargo\u2019s rights in violation of \u00a7 1322(b)(2). This Court agrees. The Plan allows the Debtor to keep the Property and also keeps the automatic stay in place to prevent Wells Fargo from foreclosing on the Property; meanwhile, the Debtor is supposed to make payments to the Morgans pursuant to the terms of the Second Lien Note, and the Morgans would presumably then turn around and remit payment to Wells Fargo under the First Lien Note.

Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v.

Morris argues that by not requiring the court to define the limits of reasonable doubt, Mississippi is in effect trampling upon the requirement that the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Mississippi however has a longstanding policy of relying upon jurors to determine whether their doubt is reasonable, and prohibits any instruction that would presume to define the nature of reasonable doubt.

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18.

After a responsive pleading has been filed, subsequent amendments are permissible only with leave of court, which \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). This liberal policy of allowing amendments under Rule 15(a) \u201ccircumscribes the exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion; thus, unless a substantial reason exists to deny leave to amend, the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.\u201d Shipner, 868 F.2d at 407; see also Moore v.

BACKGROUND The following facts are derived from the complaint and the Letter which is attached to the complaint as exhibit A. See Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 89 (2d Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). On or about August 19, 2005, the Defendants holding that 1 the complaint is deemed to include any documents incorporated in it by reference and any document upon which it solely relies and which is integral to the complaint and that the court may consider such documents on a motion to dismiss pursuant to fedrcivp 12b6holding that a court in deciding a rule 12b6 motion may consider a document that is incorporated by reference into the complaintholding that for the purpose of deciding a motion to dismiss the complaint includes any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by referenceholding that a written statement could not be regarded as an affidavit sufficient in law for any purpose because it was not sworn to by any one or before any officerholding that it was appropriate for the district court to refer to the documents attached to the motion to dismiss since the documents were referred to in the complaint & \n\nthose state laws that specifically \u201cregulate insurance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A). The Supreme Court has recently set forth a new two-part test for determining whether a state law \u201cregulates insurance\u201d and is, therefore, saved from ERISA\u2019s preemptive effect. This two-part test requires the state law to: (1) \u201cbe specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance\u201d; and (2) \u201csubstantially affect the risk pooling arrangements between the insurer and the insured.\u201d Ky. Ass\u2019n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, _ U.S. _, 123 S.Ct. 1471, 1479, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003). If this two-part inquiry reveals that the state' law regulates insurance, then the state law is saved from preemption. \u201cThis does not, however, end [the] preemption analysis.\u201d Cono Co., 337 F.3d 1138, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Fink v. Dakotacare, 324 F.3d 685, 689 (8th holding claims under the montana unfair trade practices statute were conflictpreempted because the montana law provided nonerisa damages for essentially claim processing causes of actionholding that an action which seeks nonerisa damages for what are essentially claim processing causes of actionf clearly falls under the 1132 preemption exemplified by pilot lifeholding that state law causes of action arising from improper processing of a claim for benefits are preemptedholding that a complaint that seeks nonerisa damages for what are essentially claim processing causes of action clearly fall within the ambit of 1132 preemption exemplified by pilot lifeholding that state common law causes of action asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan are removable to federal court & \n\nor while having his features artificially distorted shall, for the first of-fence be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years.... Whoever commits any offense described herein while armed with a firearm ... shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than five years. Mass. Gen. L. ch 265 \u00a7 17. As the parties agree, this creates a divisible statute because \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is not defined in the offense conduct; thus not all armed robberies would constitute firearm offenses. The analysis of a divisible statute in the immigration context is analogous to the application of sentencing enhancements in the sentencing context. In the sentencing context, the court applies Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>); in the immigration context, we apply a holding that a sentencing court in determining whether a burglary was a violent felony that resulted in an enhanced statutory minimum had to rely on charging documents elements of offenses plea colloquies and express findings by the trial judge and could not look to police reports or complaint applicationsholding that in determining whether a prior conviction is a violent felony a court generally must look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offenseholding that a court can look only to the statutory elements charging documents and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction after trial qualified as a violent felony under the accaholding that inquiry under the acca to determine statutory elements of prior conviction is limited to judicial records and may not include documents that simply state facts such as police reportsholding that courts should look to the statutory definition of the crime charged rather than the actual facts of the individuals prior conviction to determine whether the crime qualifies as a violent felony under the acca & \n\nhowever, is limited to conspiracies based upon racial or some other class-based invidious discrimination. See Romero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 34 (1st Cir.1996). There is no evidence of any such conspiracy here. The class for which the plaintiff claims protection is \u201cdivorced or otherwise single women parents.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mem. in Opp\u2019n to Def. Scott Losciuto\u2019s Reply Mem. at 6. That is not a recognized class. To the extent that the plaintiff is stating a separate claim against Scott or Janet Losciuto under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (the Complaint is unclear), it fails for lack of state action on the part of Scott or Janet Losciuto, who are private parties. See Gonzalez-Morales v. Hernandez-Arencibia, 221 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2000). Town Of Windham And Pol 123, 128 (2d Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); Brodnicki v.

Opie, 663 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201c[Fjederal law alone governs whether evidence is sufficient to raise a question for the trier-of-fact.\u201d). Applying that standard to the case before it, this court in Foster held that, at summary judgment, the plaintiff \u201cmust set forth evidence of a clear and convincing nature that, if believed by the ultimate factfinder, would establish that plaintiff was more likely than not the victim of illegal retaliation by her employer.\u201d Foster, 293 F.3d at 1195. See also Conrad v. Bd. of Johnson County Comm\u2019rs, 237 F.Supp.2d 1204, 1266-67 (D.Kan.2002) (<HOLDING>). Thus, although the state law dictated that a holding that federal courts sitting in diversity shall apply state substantive lawholding that federal courts sitting in diversity should apply state law that determines the outcome of the caseholding that if a state case explicitly states that the state standard is more favorable to the defendant than the federal standard the federal claim is considered adjudicated below when the state standard is appliedholding that a federal court sitting in diversity is bound to follow the law of the forum stateholding that for state law retaliatory discharge claims the clear and convincing standard is applied at the summary judgment stage at least when the claim is brought in a federal court sitting in diversity & \n\nso requires\u201d and that the amendment is subject to dis-allowance on the trial court\u2019s o t if allowing it would result in actual prejudice to the opposing party or for reasons of \u201cundue delay.\u201d GRE Ins. Group, 822 So.2d at 390. Undue delay can have two different meanings in a case. First, the trial court has discretion to deny an amendment to a pleading if allowing the amendment would unduly delay the trial. Horton v. Shelby Med. Ctr., 562 So.2d 127, 130 (Ala.1989). Second, an unexplained undue delay in filing an amendment when the party has had sufficient opportunity to discover the facts necessary to file the amendment earlier is also sufficient grounds upon which to deny the amendment.

The trial court entered a directed verdict on Ordonez\u2019s negligence per se claims.

These motions allege that Caine was not informed of his Miranda rights, that the police officers promised him leniency, that the police officers struck him in the head and kicked him in the stomach, and that he was intoxi cated when he gave his statement. The motions, however, do not identify any of the officers involved or describe with any particularity misconduct similar to what defendant suffered. Without some evidence indicating that the same officers or supervisors were involved or that the same type of misconduct was involved, we have no basis upon which to conclude that this evidence was relevant to defendant\u2019s claims. See People v. Hobley, 159 Ill. 2d 272, 312 (1994) (<HOLDING>).

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations.

A dispute arose between defendant and individuals purchasing parcels within the subdivision as to the extent and nature of defendant\u2019s commitment to construct roadways within the subdivision. The plaintiff-landowners filed suit alleging defendant represented that roadways would be provided as part of the development and constructed by defendant.

Procedural History This case has a complex procedural history. A brief description of that history will provide a meaningful context for the discussion to come.

Moreover, the plaintiffs' \"obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of their entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of the cause of action.\u201d Id. at 527. \"To state a valid claim, a complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory.\u201d Id. 5 . A party may recover damages in equity if there exists a contract implied in law, see Paschall's, 407 S.W.2d at 153; however, equitable relief is not available if there exists a contract implied in fact.

We must also discern the plain meaning of CrR 3.1(b)(2), while taking into account related court rules and controlling case law. \u00b611 The various stages of a criminal proceeding listed in CrR 3.1(b)(2) are more specifically covered elsewhere. For example: (1) CrR 3.1( to counsel under CrR 3.1 or CrRLJ 3.1 beyond what is constitutionally required. That stage is at the beginning, and our motivation was the preservation of evidence. See State v. Templeton, 148 Wn.2d 193, 211, 59 P.3d 632 (2002) (<HOLDING>).

This Court agrees that the Koenigs waived any claim of juror bias by not advising the Court of these allegations at a time when the Court could have done something about them. This Court conducted voir dire to find out whether any member of the jury panel recognized any of the defendants or had provided goods or services to Coastal. One member of the panel was excused due to his familiarity with the defendants. None of the jurors acknowledged any relationship or familiarity before they were empaneled. Waiver has been found where juror misconduct was only alleged, as in the Koenigs\u2019 case. See, e.g., United States v. Dean, 667 F.2d 729, 730, 734 (8th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). Waiver has also been found where there was holding that where possible juror misconduct is brought to the trial judges attention he or she has a duty to investigate and to determine whether there may have been a violation of the sixth amendmentholding that it was not constitutionally permissible for the state to respond to defendants invocation of his statutory right to appeal by bringing a more serious charge against him prior to the trial de novo holding that litigants have a duty to disclose their objection to a prospective juror by promptly bringing the matter to the attention of the trial courtholding that although this court affords broad discretion to the district court in determining the type of investigation necessary to determine juror bias the district court must provide the defendant a meaningful opportunity to prove the sameholding that the defendant by not bringing his knowledge of possible juror bias to the attention of the district court prior to verdict waived his right to a new trial & \n\ndemonstrate a violation of an individual\u2019s bodily integrity sufficient to support a constitutional violation. Moran v. Clarke, 296 F.3d 638, 647 (8th Cir.2002) (en banc) (discussing the severity of conduct necessary to establish a violation). For instance, in Reeve v. Oliver, our court refused to find a substantive due process violation when a state actor touched and rubbed a woman\u2019s back while staring at her chest. 41 F.3d 381, 382-83 (8th Cir.1994). Similarly, in Lillard v. Shelby County Bd. of Educ., 76 F.3d 716, 726 (6th Cir.1996), the Sixth Circuit held that a teacher\u2019s act of rubbing a student\u2019s stomach while he made suggestive remarks to her did not violate the student\u2019s right to bodily integrity.

Given our evaluation of the weight due to the various psychiatrists\u2019 reports, we find that the Court has sufficient evidence to make a determination regarding the defendant\u2019s competence without further proceedings. The stipulations filed by the government and defense counsel regarding defendant\u2019s competence provide a complete picture of the defendant\u2019s mental state and demeanor. Here, both parties were given a chance to provide what evidence they deemed appropriate to determine the defendant\u2019s competence. See United States v. O\u2019Neal, 969 F.2d 512, 514 (7th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). This Court holds that a competency hearing is holding that the trial court need not hold a voluntariness hearing where the defendant did not object and no evidence presented raised the issueholding that the district court did in effect hold a hearing when it gave the defense a chance to supplement a psychiatric report with further evidenceholding after remand that where the opposing party thus raises a material dispute as to the admissibility of expert scientific evidence the district court must hold an in limine hearing a socalled daubert hearing to consider the conflicting evidence holding that the lower court was not required to hold a hearing on a motion to transferholding that court did not have to hold a hearing to determine attorneys fees where detailed affidavit was provided & \n\nin first degree assault cases. In its discussion, the court held that first, second, and third degree assault are all general intent crimes, meaning that the actor need only intend the assault, not the injury which results. In State v. Swigart, 233 Neb. 517, 446 N.W.2d 216 (1989), an appeal of the defendant\u2019s first degree assault conviction, the court rejected the defend ant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction because the defendant said he did not intend to cause serious bodily injury. Similarly, Parks claims that he did not intend to hurt the baby or break his leg. The Williams court said that the assault statutes prohibit conduct consisting of acts which cause injury of various seriousness. See, also, State v. Duis, 207 Neb. 851, 301 N.W.2d 587 (1981) (<HOLDING>). The assault statutes, Neb. Rev.

Accordingly, the court will deny claim six as procedurally barred. F. Claim Seven: Post-conviction Proceedings Violated Petitioner\u2019s Due Process And Equal Protection Rights In his seventh claim, petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance of his post-conviction appeal violated his right to equal protection and due process. He complains that the State Supreme Court failed to give a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of his Massiah claims. The court concludes that this claim alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas relief, because petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware State Courts\u2019 analysis in a state collateral proceeding. See Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir.1998)(<HOLDING>)(emphasis in original); see also Lambert v. holding habeas petitioners may show cause for such default in specific circumstances in states that require petitioners to raise iatc claims in initial state habeas proceedings rather than on direct appealholding that the federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioners conviction what occurred in the petitioners collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas proceedingholding federal habeas proceeding was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies when petitioners direct appeal from resentencing was still pending in state court at the time he sought habeas reliefholding that once federal jurisdiction has attached it is not defeated by the petitioners release prior to completion of the proceedings on his habeas applicationholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nspecial education and daycare at different sites, children who receive both daycare and special education services at the same site are not entitled to transportation under the IDEA as incorporated by Minn.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 123B.88,125A.03(a).

Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim. The Walker court noted that Rule 9 was inapplicable, and held that \u201cit is enough in pleading a conspiracy to merely indicate the parties, general purpose, and approximate date, so that the defendant has notice of what he is charged with.\u201d Id. The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy.

In addition to his claim above regarding unsworn and allegedly false testimony, Martin argues that the trial court erred by permitting victim impact testimony that was improper in other ways. Because Martin failed to both raise objections and obtain rulings on them regarding any of the allegedly objectionable statements, he has forfeited his right to appeal under ordinary appellate review standards. See Smith, 287 Ga. at 30 (3) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, we conclude under the \u201cplain holding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that a party may not raise a claim on appeal that was not presented to the trial courtholding that a party must obtain a distinct ruling on an issue in order to raise it on appealholding that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal & \n\nruling precluded Bolt from testifying about the work papers. The court did not explicitly make a ruling on Bolt\u2019s testimony concerning the work papers. The court stated it was not prepared to rule on Bolt\u2019s analysis of the work papers at the beginning of the trial. The court also stated it had no problem with QCBT mentioning inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the work papers in its opening statement; The record clearly establishes the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine declared that Bolt\u2019s testimony concerning generally accepted CPA auditing standards, whether Kireher breached those standards, and causation, was inadmissible. The court did not equivocate or state it would reconsider its ruling at trial. Cf. Holst v. Countryside Enters., Inc., 14 F.3d 1319, 1323 (8th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). Thus, as to this testimony, we conclude the holding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a trial courts evidentiary ruling on a pretrial motion is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal unless a defendant renews the objection during trialholding that a party failed to preserve error by not pursuing a ruling at trial where the courts motion in limine ruling invited the party to attempt to admit the evidence during trialholding that a party had failed to preserve an argument for appellate review when that party had failed to argue the issue to the trial court either at trial or in his postjudgment motionholding that trial courts have discretion to decide whether litigation conduct violates a ruling on a motion in limine & \n\nas displaying a total lack of competence in the law.\u201d Aplt.

Nevertheless, we have carefully reviewed the holding plaintiffs scurrilous briefs that failed to address substance of claims forfeited appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that when an application letter included a statement referring to the appellate division briefs the claims in the briefs were fairly presented to highest state court because the fair import of this statement was that petitioner was requesting the new york court of appeals to review the same claims that were advanced in the appellate divisionholding that an appellant abandons an issue for purposes of appeal where he fails to argue it in his briefsholding that a habeas petitioner abandons the claims he does not address on appeal & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nany mention during cross examination of his dishonorable discharge from the Marines. The court granted defendant's motion. Despite the ruling, the State's attorney asked a question about the circumstances of his leaving the Marines and he replied, \"I deserted.\" State v. Smith, supra at 427. Defendant did not object to the question, did not move to instruct the jury to disregard the answer, and did not move to strike the answer. The Supreme Court held that defendant's motion to exclude the evidence was sufficient to preserve the error for appeal, concluded the error was prejudicial and ordered a new trial. As Smith demonstrates, a ruling on a motion to exclude evidence is not necessarily merely advisory and tentative. Accord, State v. Brooks, 20 Wn. App. 52, 59-60, 579 P.2d 961 (1978) (<HOLDING>) (citing State v. Smith, supra). If such a holding that although a defendant filed a motion in limine on an evidentiary issue a failure to object to the evidence at trial waives the issue for appealholding that a defendants failure to object or join in a codefendants objection to an issue bars the defendant from raising the issue on appealholding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that failure to object does not preclude raising the issue on appeal where erroneous evidence is offered in violation of an order in limine & \n\nalso claims that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument concerning his prior convictions. According to defendant, the State\u2019s comment was improper in that it called attention to the fact that his prior convictions were of the same crime with which he was charged here. Defendant waived this argument. In order to preserve an error for review, a defendant must both object to the alleged error at trial and renew the objection in his written posttrial motion. People v. Hunter, 331 Ill. App. 3d 1017, 1029 (2002); People v. Bennett, 304 Ill. App. 3d 69, 71 (1999). In this case, defendant failed to preserve this error for review because he did not object to the State\u2019s comment at the time it was made and he abandoned his posttrial motions. See Land, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 256 (<HOLDING>). Defendant claims that any failure to object holding that failure to file a postjudgment motion on alleged error of law relating to ruling on exception to the statute of frauds that was committed for first time in the judgment waives any objection to that ruling and that in the absence of any other formal objection the issue is not preserved for appellate reviewholding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate reviewholding that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court is limited to the grounds raised in the motionholding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the failure to obtain a ruling on a motion for new trial waives the issues raised for appellate review & \n\n108. 61 .

Bahm, 219 S.W.3d at 396 (\"While the court of appeals used the words 'reasonable grounds,\u2019 its emphasis on proof in its analysis appears to conflict with its earlier statement that an appellant does not need to establish a prima facie case to obtain a hearing on his motion for new trail.\u201d). 65 .

The instant case was holding that if the defendant fails to file a motion in the trial court to withdraw his plea he cannot attack it for the first time on appealholding that trial court did not err in ruling on appellees motion for summary judgment before appellees complied with appellants discovery request when the record reflected that appellant filed a motion to compel three days before the hearing and the record did not reveal any effort on the part of appellant to secure a ruling from the trial court on its motion to compel or object at the trial court hearing the motion for summary judgment prior to ruling on the motion to compelrecognizing that the defendant whose trial counsel represented him on motion for new trial had no opportunity to raise an ineffective assistance of counsel claim prior to appeal and remanding the case for a hearing solely on this issueholding that the trial court should have granted a motion for relief from judgment when it was the trial courts failure to serve the defendant with notice of the final judgment as required by rule 1080h1 that prevented the defendant from timely appealingholding that by denying the defendant a hearing on his motion for new trial the trial court abdicated its fact finding function and effectively prevented the defendant from making a record sufficient to challenge on appeal the policy about which he complains & \n\nbankruptcy court record, including the consolidated pre-trial order, the McFarlands\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and their post-trial, brief, shows that the McFarlands did not present the constructive trust arguments they raise on appeal to the bankruptcy court for resolution. (See Bankr. Dkt. Entries 43, 53, & 76). Nor did they make these arguments in their brief on appeal to. the district court. (See Dist. Dkt. Entry 6). Rather, they asserted throughout the underlying proceedings only that a resulting trust was established. Therefore, the McFarlands cannot now complain that the bankruptcy court failed to address whether a constructive trust was established, and we decline to consider these arguments for the first time on appeal. See In re Egidi, 571 F.3d at 1163 (<HOLDING>). In any case, the McFarlands\u2019 arguments do not holding that an argument not raised before the bankruptcy court will not be considered for the first time on appealholding that court will not consider issue raised for first time on appealholding that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this courtholding that an argument raised for the first time in response to defendants motion to dismiss instead of in an amended complaint was not properly raised before the district court and would not be considered on appealholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered & \n\nJJ., concur. 1 . On appeal, Amquip argues the trial court also erred in denying: its motion for summary judgment, the admission into evidence of depositions, and its motion for a continuance. 2 . Amquip contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its request to admit deposition transcripts into evidence and in denying its motion for continuance when it was unable to get the deposition transcripts into evidence. As mentioned previously, those issues are moot because this case is reversed on the denial of the right to a trial by jury. 3 . Although Vercon contends Amquip waived its right to a jury trial by participating in a nonjury trial, this argument relates to whether Amquip preserved the issue for appeal. See Crespo v. Crespo, 28 So.3d 125, 128 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) holding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a claim was not preserved for review where the defense failed to object on the specific grounds advanced on appealholding that the defendant waived the issue on appeal when he failed to contemporaneously object to the admission of such evidence at trialholding exwifes claim regarding admission of parol evidence was not preserved for appeal because she failed to object to the evidence or to having an evidentiary hearing & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v.

Resurrection Mining Co., 115 Colo. 396, 174 P.2d 727 (1946), for the proposition that a party should not have to search property titles before resorting to service by publication is misplaced. Both cases involve a county treasurer's obligation to ascertain the current addresses of delinquent property taxpayers before issuing tax deeds. Under section 39-11-128, C.R.S$.2015, a county treasurer must make \"diligent inquiry\" into information available in county records. Neither Siddoway nor White Cap Mining Co. say that a treasurer has no duty to search county records; they merely state that a treasurer need not search beyond county records to ascertain taxpayers' addresses. See Siddoway, 189 Colo. at 176, 538 P.2d at 113 (<HOLDING>); White Cap Mining Co., 115 Colo. at 408, 174 holding that this court need not address the merits of an argument raised for the first time on appealholding appellate court need not address issues unnecessary to its decisionholding that an administrator need not address each piece of evidenceholding that a treasurer need not search miscellaneous personal correspondence after an address had been found in the countys recordsholding that where a party does not adequately brief an argument we need not address it on appeal & \n\nit construed the claim. The court will address these arguments in turn, and then will turn to whether there was substantial evidence presented at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The court finds Honeywell\u2019s argument that Sundstrand\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to support a conclusion of non-infringement to be unpersuasive. Even considering that Shinskey said at one point that, \u201cI believe that claim C and claim D must both apply at the same time,\u201d Tr. 1407-08, this does not render Sundstrand\u2019s entire case legally insufficient. Although Shinskey may have made this statement, it is clear that his opinion as to why the APS 3200 did not literally infringe each element of Claim 4 of the \u2019194 patent did not depend on this statement. But see LNP Eng\u2019g Plastics, 77 F.Supp.2d at 549 (<HOLDING>).

Upon careful review of the complaints submitted in the Saunders cases with the original Canady I complaint, we find no perceivable difference in the issues presented. Each petition alleges that appellants, as a class, identified by the same definition, were harmed by the same redlining practices employed by the homeowners\u2019 insurance industry.

Initially, the Court notes that it will address only those arguments adequately raised by the appellant in his briefs. See Ford v. Gober, 10 Vet.App. 531, 535-36 (1997) (<HOLDING>); Grivois v.

In line with this mode of analysis, the court below, after concluding that the Medicare Act does not preclude general federal-question jurisdiction over a preenforcement challenge to the Secretary\u2019s regulations, held that respondent\u2019s APA notice-and-comment challenge was ripe but that its . constitutional vagueness claim was not. 143 F. 3d, at 1076-1077. express no view on the proper application of ripeness doctrine to respondent\u2019s claims, I am confident that this method of analysis enjoys substantially more support in our eases than does the majority\u2019s approach, which prescribes a case-by-case hardship inquiry at the threshold stage of determining whether preenforcement review has been precluded by statute.

Defendants have attached both an affidavit and the tax returns for the prior three years to their Motion to Dismiss, and these documents reflect that Pegaso\u2019s gross sale volume falls short of $500,000. In light of the evidence presented by Defendants, this Court finds Defendants have established that the restaurant does not meet the FLSA \u201centerprise\u201d standard. Plaintiff claims that it is premature for this Court to make a dispositive finding with respect to the gross volume of sales issue and asks that this Court provide her an opportunity to conduct further discovery. As discovery on this matter would not lead to any genuine issues of fact, this Court cannot accede to Plaintiffs request. Cf. Strag v. Board of Trustees, 55 F.3d 943, 954 (4th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Even if an employer does not meet the holding that under rule 56f nonmoving party seeking additional discovery must demonstrate precisely how additional discovery will lead to a genuine issue of material factholding that there was a genuine issue of material fact precluding summary judgmentholding that a court may deny a rule 56f motion where the additional evidence sought for discovery would not have by itself created a genuine issue of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgmentholding that rule 56f may not defeat summary judgment where the result of a continuance to obtain further information would be wholly speculativeholding that the court was precluded from considering whether the district court had abused its discretion in ruling on defendants summary judgment motion before allowing plaintiff to conduct requested discovery where the plaintiff had not filed an affidavit pursuant to rule 56f and stating that when a party does not avail himself of relief under rule 56f it is generally not an abuse of discretion for the district court to rule on the motion for summary judgment citation omitted & \n\neasily originated from a large number of sources, including the carpet, comforter, victim\u2019s nightshirt, or any of the items thought to have been emptied from her purse which were discovered under the comforter upon which her body was found. See id. Likewise, the hair could have attached on contact with the belt or clothesline rope that were also used to bind Susan. See id. Thus, the conclusory assertion that if the hair does not belong to Overton or the victims, it must belong to a person who committed or participated in the crime, is far too tenuous because there is no way to determine when, why, where, or how the hairs attached to the tape. This assertion is the type of speculation that this Court has found to be a basis for denying a rule 3.853 motion. See Lott, 931 So.2d at 821 (<HOLDING>); Hitchcock v. State, 866 So.2d 23, 26 holding that a defendant whose new trial motion is based on the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel may bypass rule 33s sevenday time limit only if his claim that his counsel was ineffective was based on information unavailable to the defendant at the time of trialholding a written order is required for an appeal from a convicting courts ruling on a postconviction motion for dna testingrecognizing that an order for dna testing could cause irreparable harm because the test is intrusive and any error in improperly ordering genetic testing cannot be remedied on appeal after the testing is done and the results are releasedholding that the defendant embarked on a fishing expedition for genetic material whose potential relevance is pure conjecture and that the defendant could not obtain dna testing based on the speculative allegations in his motionholding that to obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence the defendant must allege facts from which the court may infer diligence on the part of the defendant & \n\nfailing to obtain a final ruling on the right to consul issue. We agree. In State v. Riker, 123 Wn.2d 351, 369, 869 P.2d 43 (1994), the Court held that a defendant who does not seek a final ruling on a motion in limine after a court issues a tentative ruling waives any objection to the exclusion of the evidence. Similarly, in State v. Koloske, the Court noted that \u201c[w]hen the trial court refuses to rule, or makes only a tentative ruling subject to evidence developed at trial, the parties are under a duty to raise the issue at the appropriate time with proper objections at trial.\u201d 100 Wn.2d 889, 896, 676 P.2d 456 (1984), overruled on other grounds by State v. Brown, 111 Wn.2d 124, 761 P.2d 588 (1988). Cf. Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 375-76, 118 S. Ct. 1352, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529 (1998) (<HOLDING>). During his CrR 3.5 hearing, Acosta raised the holding no right to counsel for capital defendants in state habeas proceedingsholding that the vienna convention must be applied in conformity with the laws and regulations of the united states including the rules for federal habeas reliefholding that habeas petitioner scheduled to be executed in the state of virginia for capital murder could not raise claim of violation of his rights under the vienna convention on federal habeas review where he failed to preserve the claim by raising it in state court proceedings vienna convention does not trump subsequent federal statute requiring habeas petitioners who claim to be held in violation of treaties of the united states to develop factual bases for their claims in state court as a precondition of federal habeas reviewholding that infirmities in state habeas proceedings do not constitute grounds for federal habeas reliefholding that a petitioner should be permitted to seek habeas review in state court even if there were doubt that the states substantive law would permit a habeas petition & \n\n496, 745 P.2d 717, 721 (Ct.App. 1987). In this case, Plaintiff filed a pretrial motion to exclude the assailant from being considered a concurrent tortfeasor. The motion cited Lujan v. Healthsouth Rehabilitation Gorp., 120 N.M. 422, 902 P.2d 1025 (1995), the same authority Plaintiff relies on in this appeal. Plaintiff thus fairly invoked a ruling of the trial court on this issue and preserved it for appeal. See id. (explaining liabilities of concurrent and successive tortfeasors). {36} We are unpersuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to preserve this issue by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on comparative negligence.

Some of the cases the majority offers to support its argument are inapplicable, as well, because they rely on a lower standard than that required in South Dakota. See, e.g., Appleby, 22 Ark.App. 243, 738 S.W.2d 807 (considering whether an employee's actions aggravating a pri- or injury were merely reasonable); Amoco Chemical Corp., 318 A.2d 614 (<HOLDING>); Johnnie\u2019s Produce Co., 120 So.2d 12 (noting a holding exclusion h does not apply where employees were merely negligentholding that it is well established that whether an employees actions were within the scope of employment is a question of fact and even if some of the actions were unauthorized the question of whether the actions were within the scope of employment is for the juryholding that written warnings that impacted the probability an employee would be terminated are adverse employment actionsholding an employees actions in disregarding his doctors warnings were negligentrecognizing as viable actions in tort negligent hiring and negligent retention & \n\nafter learning that leave was needed for a serious health condition. In determining whether an employee provided sufficient notice to his employer, the Sixth Circuit has held that the \u201ccritical question is whether the information imparted to the employer is sufficient to reasonably apprise it of the employee\u2019s request to take time off for a serious health condition.\u201d Brohm v. JH Properties, Inc., 149 F.3d 517, 523 (6th Cir.1998). Courts have held that an employee merely notifying his employer that he is sick, without more, is not sufficient notice to invoke the FMLA. Rather, the employee must notify the employer that he is suffering from a serious health condition that prevents him from performing his normal job. Hammon v. DHL Airways, Inc., 165 F.3d 441, 451 (6th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) Although \u201c[t]he employee need not assert his holding an employee is an agent of his employer where the employer assumes the right to control time manner and method of workholding that an employee requesting unforeseeable medical leave is not required to even mention the fmla when requesting leave for a serious health conditionholding that the employee must at least provide his employer with enough information for the employer to be put on notice that the fmla is a considerationholding that an employee gives his employer sufficient notice that he is requesting leave for an fmlaqualifying condition when he gives the employer enough information for the employer to reasonably conclude that an event described in 29 usc 2612a1 has occurredholding that an employer may deny restoration when it can show that it would have discharged the employee in any event regardless of the leave & \n\ndefendants. Id. at 615, 117 S.Ct. 2231. Hence, the district court must engage in a rigorous analysis of whether the Rule\u2019s requirements have actually been met. Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160-61, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). At times the issues may be plain enough for the court to make its determina tion only on the pleadings. If need be, however, the district court may probe behind the pleadings and forecast what kind of evidence may be required or allowed at trial. See id. Of course, the court must bear in mind that plaintiffs are not required to prove their case at the certification stage. Thus, certification is not an appropriate time to examine the merits. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974) (<HOLDING>); In re Visa Check\/MasterMoney Antitrust holding that while it is not appropriate to consider the merits in determining certification the admissibility of all evidence which has relevance to the merits is not barred if it is relevant to the purpose of refuting or supporting the existence of a classholding that the court has no authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of an action to determine whether it may be maintained as a class actionholding certification is not an occasion for inquiry into the meritsholding that an employers inquiry into the reason for an employees work absences was a permissible jobrelated inquiry under the adaholding that the court may only make a facial inquiry into the validity of the certification & \n\nthe office during normal business hours.

Dr. Thorne was employed by PFC and assigned to perform examinations of police officers who suffered work related injuries or illness. See PL Opp., Ex. 6. But courts have recognized that the patient-physician relationship does not attach in circumstances where a physician is hired by an employer to conduct examinations of employees. See Betesh v.

Wood also cited \u00a7 523(a)(2) in her complaint, however, Wood has never argued this theory applied under these facts. The Court considers any claim by Wood under this Code section to have been abandoned by Wood. 8 . Assuming a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words, and to give additional context and flavor to this discussion, a photo of the subject truck, admitted in evidence in this action, is appended to this decision. 9 .

Terry\u2019s income which accumulated during the parties\u2019 marriage was a marital asset. Compare, Meints v. Meints, 258 Neb. 1017, 608 N.W.2d 564 (2000) (<HOLDING>); Parde v.

Section 541(a)(7) makes property of the estate any interest in properly that the estate (not the debtor) acquires after the case. Here, the bankruptcy court found that the bonus constituted earnings from personal services of Mr. Markosian under \u00a7 1115(a)(2) and that ruling was not appealed. Thus, the earnings fall within the earnings exception stated in \u00a7 541(a)(6). We note however that there may be chapter 11 cases which are converted to chapter 7 where it is necessary to separate earnings from personal services by an individual from the earnings of a business. See FitzSimmons v. Walsh (In re FitzSimmons), 725 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir.1984) holding noncompete payments were not exempt from the debt ors bankruptcy estate as earnings from postpetition services under 541a6 because the noncompete agreement was inextricably intertwined with the debtors sale of stock that was an includable bankruptcy asset that predated debtors bankruptcy petitionholding that where the debtor is the owner of a policy insuring his own life and listing his wife as the beneficiary upon his death the proceeds of the policy including the cash value thereof are exempt from the claims of the insureds creditorsholding that proceeds of a personal injury settlement are not exempt under missouri lawholding that where subchapter s corporations revenue was generated from professional accounting services of its sole shareholder or from personal services performed under him funds generated by the business which shareholder withdrew to pay personal expenses although not denominated wages for purposes of bookkeeping could be considered wages for purposes of calculating preinjury wageholding that only the debtors earnings from his own personal services were exempt under 541a6 as opposed to all profits generated by his law practice & \n\nthe debtor may only do so \u201csubject\u201d to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. See 1322(b)(7). Consequently, the Debtor has the option of assuming the Lease in his Plan but, in opting to do so, he obligates himself to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 365 which he has not done. There is no provision in his Plan for curing his default or providing adequate assurance of his future performance under the Lease. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(b). Furthermore, while the Bankruptcy Code permits a Chapter 13 debtor to modify the rights of certain holders of secured claims, since the Movants are parties to an unexpired lease and not a security agreement, the Debtor is not entitled to modify the terms of the Lease and force Movants to finance his purchase of the Vehicle.

O (Exs. C-E to Dist, Ct. Compl.), and the breach of contract claim is therefore property of his estate, see O\u2019Dowd v. Trueger (In re O'Dowd), 233 F.3d 197, 202 (3d Cir. 2000) (recognizing a pre-petition cause of action is property of the estate). Insofar as the Consulting Agreement payments are recovered in the Contract Action, such payments will not be for any services actually performed by Segal but will be damages for his pre-petition breach of contract claim and will therefore be property of the estate. See Venn v. Sherman (In re Sherman), 322 B.R. 889, 892-93 (Bankr.N.D.Fla.2004) (<HOLDING>); cf.

Under the \u201cactual effects\u201d test, it is clear that Washington\u2019s percentage-based penalty provisions are not primarily imposed to compensate the state. The State\u2019s contention that it incurs costs in the collection of unpaid taxes is irrelevant because the provisions\u2019 \u201cactual effect\u201d has no direct relation to any specific costs incurred by the State. Furthermore, as the district court observed, other courts have held that escalating percentage-based penalties imposed in addition to interest are generally punitive rather than compensatory in effect. A The Tenth Circuit and a bankruptcy court in this circuit have concluded that pereent- age-based penalties for unpaid taxes were punitive rather than compensatory. See, e.g., In re Cassidy, 983 F.2d 161, 164-65 (10th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); In re E.A.

In the final analysis, though, this panel cannot provide relief. If we were to rule in favor of Appellant on the summary judgment issue, Appellant could perhaps seek money damages from the proceeds of the sale received by the bankruptcy estate.

King et al., Collier on holding that although cost of funds approach more appropriately reflects the present value of a creditors allowed claim it is difficult to administer and therefore the interest rate should be fixed at the rate on a united states treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtors reorganization planholding that bankruptcy plan of reorganization rather than 1961 controlled the setting of the interest rateholding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that the proper rate for prejudgment interest is the rate fixed by the parties in a contract & \n\n\u00b6 30; Adv. No. 03-09315, ECF Doc. #27, Exh. A. As this is the exact language of the clause in JLM that the Second Circuit held to be broad, the clauses in these four adversary proceedings should also be treated as broad form clauses. Therefore, under the Collins decision there is \u201ca presumption of arbitrability.\u201d Collins, 58 F.3d at 23. However, even with a broad form clause, if the claims present \u201cno questions in respect of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under [the agreements],\u201d they are outside the purview of the arbitration clause and are not arbitrable. Id. B. Are the Preferential Transfer Claims Within the Scope of the Arbitration Agreement? In this Circuit, courts have exempted fraudulent transfer claims from arbitration because they are statutory claims belo (2d Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). However, none of those decisions undermines holding judgment in violation of automatic stay voidrecognizing district courts authority to dispose of contempt action for violation of automatic stay of bankruptcyholding that a postdischarge claim for violation of the automatic stay was arbitrable because it would not necessarily jeopardize or inherently conflict with the bankruptcy codeholding that the automatic stay did not bar the filing of a proof of claim where the debtor actively litigated a separate action during the pending bankruptcy proceeding because to permit the automatic stay provision to be used as a trump card played after an unfavorable result was reached would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the automatic stayrecognizing that any action taken in violation of the automatic bankruptcy stay is void and without effect & \n\nfrom trying to steal a march on each other, In re Holtkamp, 669 F.2d 505, 508 (7th Cir.1982), and the automatic stay is essential to accomplishing this purpose. There is, in contrast, no policy of preventing persons whom the bankrupt has sued from protecting their legal rights. True, the bankrupt\u2019s cause of action is an asset of the estate; but as the defendant in the bankrupt\u2019s suit is not by opposing that suit, seeking to take possession of it, subsection (a)(3) is no more applicable that (a)(1) is.

The Debtors conceded that the administrative claim was proper to the extent that it covered only the post-petition portion of the first quarter of 1995. The claim of the IRS for administrative expenses for the post-petition portion of the first quarter of 1995 is allowable to the extent that it seeks taxes, fines and penalties. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(l)(B)(C). The Court will determine whether post-petition interest is an administrative expense. 4 . Prior to the Court's decision, one circuit court had addressed the issue. See United States v. Friendship College, Inc. (In re Friendship College, Inc.), 737 F.2d 430, 433 (4th Cir.1984) holding that interest on postpetition taxes incurred by the debtor during chapter 11 reorganization is an administrative expenseholding confirmation vested property in the debtor and therefore properly of the estate was not liable for postconfirmation taxes incurred by debtorholding that an individual debtor not engaged in business is eligible for chapter 11holding in a case where a chapter 11 trustee was appointed after a period during which the debt or had operated as debtor in possession that a chapter 11 trustee has two years from the date of his appointment not from the commencement of the chapter 11 case to bring avoidance actionsholding that licensor was entitled to administrative expense priority claim where debtor remained in possession postpetition of real property under a license agreement & \n\nWeintraub and Resnick, Freezing, the Debtor\u2019s Account: A Banker\u2019s Dilemma Under the Bankruptcy Code, 100 Banking Law Journal 316, 321-22 (1983); Groschadl, \u201cFreezing\u201d the Debtor\u2019s Bank Account: A Violation of the Automatic Stay?, 57 American Bankruptcy Law Journal 75, 77 (1983); Freeman, Setoff Under the New Bankruptcy Code: The Effect on Bankers, 97 Banking Law Journal 484, 506 (1980). Unquestionably, if the funds in the bank accounts are indeed cash collateral, that is, if the bank has a valid claim within 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a), subject to a setoff not defeated by the exceptions in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a), then the debtor in possession must obtain the Court\u2019s authorization or the bank\u2019s consent before drawing on the funds, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(c)(2). See Cusanno v. Fidelity Bank, 29 B.R. at 812 (<HOLDING>). Since, if the bank is right about the status holding that a chapter 13 debtor should be able to obtain a copy of his transcript in light of the broader discharge provision of chapter 13holding that notwithstanding a debtors inability to obtain a chapter 13 discharge a debtor is nonetheless eligible to file a chapter 13 caseholding that there is no statutory authority in chapter 13 which grants a chapter 13 debtor independent standing to sue under the trustees avoidance powerrecognizing the requirement of 363 to obtain approval or consent in a chapter 13 caseholding tort action accruing after original chapter 7 petition not part of estate when case converted to chapter 13 and then back to chapter 7 & \n\nno confidential\/fiduciary relationship existed because the parties were adversaries, each represented by their own attorney. On appeal, Virginia contends the law permits the inference of a confidential relationship to the extent Edwin holds property in excess of $690,000 that rightfully belongs to her. We disagree with Virginia\u2019s argument. Texas law recognizes that a relationship on which a constructive trust can be based may be an informal fiduciary relationship that arises from a moral, social, domestic, or purely personal relationship of trust and confidence. Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247, 253 (Tex. 1962). However, any such fiduciary relationship between Edwin and Virginia terminated when they divorced. See Solares v. Solares, 232 S.W.3d 873, 881 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2007, no pet.) (<HOLDING>); In re Marriage of Notash, 118 S.W.3d 868, 872 holding that a corporate entity must be represented by licensed counselholding in a contested divorce where each spouse is independently represented by counsel the fiduciary relationship terminatesholding that the automatic stay terminates completely as to a serially filing spouse but remains in force as to a newly filing spouserecognizing a defendants constitutional right to be represented by counsel of his own choicerecognizing that the rights accorded by the homestead laws vest independently in each spouse regardless of whether one spouse or both actually owns the fee interest in the homestead & \n\ninterest at the Maturity\/Default Rate for all times after the maturity of the notes. II. Balancing the Equities Debtor suggests that this Court balance the equities involved in allowing CBE to calculate its claim using the Maturity\/ Default Rate. I rejected the \u201cbalancing of the equities\u201d method in Gillikin. See also In re Sublett, 895 F.2d 1381 (11th Cir.1990) (rejecting the \u201cbalancing the equities\u201d approach to the extent it contravenes clear language in the Bankruptcy Code). Even if this Court had not rejected that approach, the equities in this case would not justify a different outcome in this case. Debtor is solvent, and any decrease in its interest rate would only benefit the Debtor once it emerges from bankruptcy. Summary of Schedules, Dckt. No. 21. Sublett, 895 F.2d at 1385-86 (<HOLDING>); cf. In re Holmes, 330 B.R. 317, 321 holding that nonconsensual oversecured tax claim is entitled to the statutory rate of interest unless the statutory rate constitutes a penaltyholding that an oversecured creditor is entitled to postpetition interest if the creditor is oversecured or if the estate proves to be solventholding that when an oversecured creditor seeks interest on its claim courts apply the interest rate provided for in the contractholding that when a creditor is oversecured solvency is not required for the creditor to be entitled to postpetition interest and fees and granting contractual default interest to the oversecured creditor of approximately 24holding that nonconsensual oversecured creditor shall receive the statutory rate of interest unless it can be characterized as a penalty & \n\nthe debtor, who could with impunity demand the return of property repossessed pre-petition informally, realizes that it cannot prevail and thus declines to file an adversary proceeding to recover the property. ORDER Pursuant to the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, IT IS THE ORDER OF THIS COURT that Defendant, which repossessed Debtor\u2019s vehicle pre-petition, did not violate the automatic stay by refusing to voluntarily return the vehicle to Debtor after the Chapter 13 case was filed. Therefore, the Clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of the Defendant. 1 . Of course sometimes creditors are told by debtors or individuals acting on a debtor\u2019s behalf that a case is pending when in fact it has not been filed. See In re Karis, 208 B.R. 913 (Bankr. W.D.Wis.1997) (<HOLDING>). Sometimes this representation is innocent as holding a tape of a telephone call was admissible because one party to the call consented to the recordingholding that utility customers mailing of a petition did not constitute the filing of the petition as filing was not effectuated until the petition was received by the clerkholding that telephone call from debtors attorney did not constitute notice of bankruptcy filing because petition had not in fact been filedholding that a debtors entitlement to an exemption under 522d1 is determined as of the filing date of a bankruptcy petitionholding pursuant to bankruptcy rule 7004b9 that because the creditor mailed the complaint and summons to the debtors attorney and to the address listed in the debtors bankruptcy petition service of process was sufficient even if the debtors were out of the country and did not actually receive notice of the complaint and summons & \n\nmortgagor without adhering to the due on sale clause is not permitted to cure the mortgage defaults through the Chapter 13 plan over the objection of the mortgage holder.\u201d In re Tewell, 355 B.R. at 682. Here, the Debtor seeks to do exactly that under the Plan. Wells Fargo has objected to the Plan and argues that it impermissi-bly modifies Wells Fargo\u2019s rights in violation of \u00a7 1322(b)(2). This Court agrees. The Plan allows the Debtor to keep the Property and also keeps the automatic stay in place to prevent Wells Fargo from foreclosing on the Property; meanwhile, the Debtor is supposed to make payments to the Morgans pursuant to the terms of the Second Lien Note, and the Morgans would presumably then turn around and remit payment to Wells Fargo under the First Lien Note. Under th 1) (<HOLDING>); In re Mendoza, 2010 WL 1610120, 2010 holding that a debtor may cure a default after acceleration but expressing no limit on the rightholding debtor could include property because the bank accepted payments directly from the debtor and had previously allowed the debtor to cure defaultholding that the debtor had the right to cure the default because the foreclosure sale was not complete under state law until it was confirmed by a courtholding debtor could cure after the debtor had previously made payments to the bankholding debtor could cure default partly because the bank held a recourse loan and therefore could recover against the original borrower personally & \n\nSocial Services, Inc., 509 U. S. 43, 56-66 (1993) (similar). In line with this mode of analysis, the court below, after concluding that the Medicare Act does not preclude general federal-question jurisdiction over a preenforcement challenge to the Secretary\u2019s regulations, held that respondent\u2019s APA notice-and-comment challenge was ripe but that its . constitutional vagueness claim was not. 143 F. 3d, at 1076-1077. express no view on the proper application of ripeness doctrine to respondent\u2019s claims, I am confident that this method of analysis enjoys substantially more support in our eases than does the majority\u2019s approach, which prescribes a case-by-case hardship inquiry at the threshold stage of determining whether preenforcement review has been precluded by statute. See ante, at 20 (<HOLDING>). While the majority\u2019s variation would be holding that 1395u does not incorporate 405h where the aggrieved party can obtain no review at all unless it can obtain judicial review in a 1331 actionholding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordholding that a party to an administrative proceeding failed to effectively obtain judicial review where the party filed a response to another partys petition rather than a separate petitionholding that a party may not invoke the capable of repetition yet evading review exception where its failure to obtain prompt relief has prevented judicial reviewholding failure to argue elements or obtain ruling on judicial estoppel precluded review & \n\nthan from isolated words. [Citations omitted.] The plain language used in \u00b6 11(A) clearly and unambiguously provides for automatic 10-year renewals \u201cunless an instrument signed by a majority of the then owners of the lots has been recorded. . . .\u201d The covenant prescribed a definite period of 10 years for modification by a majority of the then lot owners. The 10-year automatic extension language would be rendered meaningless if the covenant could be amended by a majority vote (less than unanimous) at any time on or after June 27, 1997. Thus, the plain language of the covenant causes the reference to \u201cperiods of ten years\u201d to be a restriction regarding the frequency of amendment by less than a unanimous vote.

Judge NIEMEYER wrote the opinion, in which Judge LEE joined. Judge KING wrote a dissenting opinion. OPINION NIEMEYER, Circuit Judge: This appeal presents the question of first impression in this circuit whether and to what extent the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), in prosecuting a suit in its own name, is bound by a private arbitration agreement between the charging party and his employer.

But see In re Rodriquez, 258 F.3d at 759 (finding the appeal moot because the appellant was challenging the sale of property from the bankruptcy estate where there was no stay pending appeal); Wintz, 219 F.3d at 812 (finding the appeal moot because the appellants failed to obtain a stay pending appeal and thus were barred from attempting to overturn the sale of the property from the bankruptcy estate). In the final analysis, though, this panel cannot provide relief. If we were to rule in favor of Appellant on the summary judgment issue, Appellant could perhaps seek money damages from the proceeds of the sale received by the bankruptcy estate. See In re Popkin & Stem, 223 F.3d 764, 766 n. 2 (8th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). However, obtaining money damages equal to the holding that exhaustion is required under the plra even if the plaintiff seeks only money damages and money damages are not available as reliefholding that the loss of trade secrets cannot be measured in money damagesholding that even if the sale cannot be undone nor property specifically awarded parties may still receive money damages for their lossholding that attorneys fees may be awarded against a public official even when the official is immune from money damagesholding that the loss of money from a bank account does not constitute irreparable harm because that loss can be compensat ed by money damages & \n\nprotections afforded to the debtors by the Bankruptcy Code and the automatic stay, specifically because the Adversary Proceeding will determine whether the debtors were in default and thus whether Bank of America is entitled to recover from the guarantors. This, the court believes, is precisely what the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception encompasses. 10 . Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\n"}

Standard of Review A district court hearing an appeal from a Bankruptcy Court reviews the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, see Fed.R.Bankr.P. 8013, while its conclusions of law are reviewed under the de novo standard. See In re AroChem Corp., 176 F.3d 610, 620 (2d Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) (citation omitted); In re Bennett Funding holding that we review for clear error the bankruptcy courts factual findingsholding that we review the bankruptcy court decision independently accepting its factual findings unless clearly erroneous but reviewing its conclusions of law de novoholding that we review legal conclusions of the court of federal claims de novoholding that we review agency determinations of law de novoholding that on review of a motion to suppress the appellate court is to give deference to a trial courts factual findings but legal conclusions are reviewed de novo & \n\nis disabled, but rather whether the ALJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence. For the following reasons, we hold that the ALJ\u2019s findings were sufficiently supported to pass muster under our deferential standard of review. A. Extent of Disability Plaintiff first contends that the ALJ\u2019s findings were not supported by substantial evidence because he failed to consider the SPD\u2019s full effects in finding Plaintiff not disabled. In determining the extent of Plaintiffs disability, the Secretary must consider the physical abilities,. mental impairments and any other impairments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545; 416.945. In making such assessments the Secretary is entitled-to rely on the conclusions of qualified expert medical professionals. Moothart v. Bowen, 934 F.2d 114, 116 (7th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). At Plaintiffs hearing the ALJ received the holding that a courts role in reviewing an administrative agency decision is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agencys findings and conclusions and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of lawholding that a reviewing court has the power to reject the findings and conclusions of the trial court where the findings are not supported by the evidenceholding review of sufficiency of evidence of juvenile adjudication is same as reviewing substantial evidence to support a criminal convictionholding that reviewing courts will review the engineers decision for substantial evidenceholding that the findings of reviewing physicians constituted substantial evidence in support of the secretarys decision to deny benefits & \n\ndeclined to provide a breath sample. At some point during or after the booking process, appellant complained of chest and wrist pain, so the police called for an ambulance. The trial court found appellant guilty of DWI, and this appeal followed. Sufficiency of the Evidence In his sole issue, appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his DWI conviction. A. Standard of Review When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational fact finder could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

Our review of \u201call of the evidence\u201d includes holding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that appellate court could not review the sufficiency of the evidence based on a particular legal standard because that standard was not submitted to the jury and no party objected to the charge on this ground or requested that the jury be charged using this standardholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdictholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\njurisprudence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in Highmark Inc. v.

ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1749, 188 L.Ed.2d 816 (2014). Those decisions call into ques tion our two-part test for determining willfulness, In re Seagate Tech., LLC, 497 F.3d 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007) (en banc), and our de novo standard for reviewing the district court\u2019s willfulness determination, Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc., 682 F.3d 1003, 1006-07 (Fed.Cir.2012) (Bard II). See Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 769 F.3d 1371, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2014) (O\u2019Malley, J., concurring). This case demonstrates why de no t. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (<HOLDING>).

Findings of the District Court Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), trial courts should and must \u201cstate legal and factual conclusions sufficient to give an appellate court a clear understanding of the grounds of its decision.\u201d White Indus., Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 845 F.2d 1497, 1499 (8th Cir.1988). If an appellate court does not know what facts the trial court took into consideration in drawing its conclusions, its findings become suspect. See Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 5 F.3d 1477, 1479 (Fed.Cir.1993) (remanding because the district court\u2019s findings were \u201ctoo conclusory and sparse\u201d to provide a factual basis for appellate review); EEOC v. United Va. Bank\/Seaboard Nat\u2019l, 555 F.2d 403, 406 (4th Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>). The only critical fact the district court holding that it is the commissioners findings of fact to the extent they modify or replace the administrative law judges findings that are relevant on appealholding that a reviewing court has the power to reject the findings and conclusions of the trial court where the findings are not supported by the evidenceholding that appellate review is precluded when the trial court provides only conclusory findings illuminated by no subsidiary findings or reasoning on all the relevant factsholding that as long as the findings are supported by substantial evidence the board must defer to the hearing committees credibility determinations because they are subsidiary findings of basic factsholding the findings of fact required to support an alimony award are sufficient if findings of fact have been made on the ultimate facts at issue in the case and the findings of fact show the trial court properly applied the law in the case & \n\nHRS \u00a7 11\u2014 13 that Kaho'ohalahala was a Lanai resident, which is a conclusion of law reviewable under the right\/wrong standard. Dupree states that the Board\u2019s determination that Kaho'ohalahala was not a Lanai resident is entitled to \u201ca presumption of validity[,\u201d] citing Keliipuleole v. Wilson, 85 Hawai'i 217, 226, 941 P.2d 300, 309 (1997). In Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), Inc. v. Int\u2019l Longshore & Warehouse Union, 112 Hawai'i 489, 146 P.3d 1066 (2006), this court identified the applicable standard of review as follows: An agency\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, while an agency\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. A conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous stand 0, 179 P.3d 1050, 1053, 1056-57 (2008) (<HOLDING>). B.

In its order, the trial court found \u201cthat plaintiff [Chandler] would not be able to assert fraud based upon a fraudulent inducement to enter into a contract to pay a portion of revenue monies since the former has been determined to be a void contract as against public policy.\u201d In light of our holdings in parts I, II, and III, we conclude that the reasoning given by the trial court in support of the summary judgment on the fraud claim was incorrect. The question then becomes whether the summary judgment can be sustained on any other grounds. See Lowe v. East End Memorial Hosp. & Health Centers, 477 So.2d 339 (Ala.1985) (<HOLDING>). After reviewing the record and the holding that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court is limited to the grounds raised in the motionholding that a trial court can only consider admissible evidence in ruling on a motion for summary judgmentholding summary judgment must be upheld if it is proper on any groundsholding that on appeal a summary judgment ruling will be upheld if it can be sustained on any grounds even if the trial court gave an incorrect reason for its rulingholding that a trial courts ruling on a motion for new trial will be upheld if it is correct on any applicable legal theory even if the court articulated an invalid basis & \n\ndamage to the front end, and a broken steering wheel. Is this the damage which Dr. Brown says is essential to his opinion? What of damage to the frame and understructure of the car? If speed is to be based partially on the damage done to the vehicles, that damage must be ascertained by something more than looking at a picture of the exterior of the automobile. No case has been cited to us which is factually similar to the one now before us. However we find substantial support for the views here expressed in Twidwell v. Davidson, 54 Wash.2d 75, 338 P.2d 326, 329-332; Stephanofsky v. Hill, 136 Conn. 379, 71 A.2d 560, 561; Kale v. Douthitt, 4 Cir., 274 F.2d 476, 480-483 (dealing particularly with evidence as to the angle of impact); Levine v. Remolif, 80 Nev. 168, 390 P.2d 718, 719-721 (<HOLDING>); Anderson v. Broome, Tex.Civ.App., 233 S.W.2d holding trial court properly excluded testimony concerning speed of vehicle where witness observed vehicle travel on a diagonal for thirtyfive 35 feet on poorly lit road estimate of speed may not be predicated on such a slender data base holding that an experts opinion must be based on facts in evidence or within his or her knowledge and that the admission of an experts opinion is reviewed for an abuse of discretionholding that rules of evidence do not permit an expert to give opinion or state legal conclusions regarding a question of lawholding that a picture of a damaged vehicle was insufficient to permit an opinion of speed based on damage to the vehiclesrecognizing that a common illustration of an admissible opinion under rule 701 is an expression of opinion by a lay observer of a cars speed & \n\nfinding of fact by the WCJ to sufficiently support the suspension of benefits. Employer claims the Suspension Order is free from error. Under Section 422(a) of the Act, a WCJ must issue a \u201creasoned decision containing findings of fact and conclusions of law\u201d which would enable the parties to understand the rationale for the resulting decision and provide a reviewing court a \u201cbasis for meaningful appellate review.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 834. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Daniels, elaborated on this standard and held that the WCJ decision must allow for adequate review by the Board and appellate courts \u201cwithout further elucidation.\u201d Daniels, 574 Pa. at 76, 828 A.2d at 1052. See also O\u2019Donnell v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (United Parcel Service), 831 A.2d 784, 790 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003) (<HOLDING>). Section 314 of the Act permits an employer to holding that credibility determinations are reviewed only for substantial evidenceholding the wcjs credibility determinations precluded any meaningful appellate review because the court had to imagine why the wcj made such credibility determinationsholding that credibility determinations are for the juryholding that we review adverse credibility determinations for substantial evidenceholding that in determining the propriety of summary judgment credibility determinations may not be made & \n\nonly relies on a self-serving affidavit. Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (stating that \u201csummary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition\u201d). The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nconsidered by the jury in its sentencing deliberations, this same evidence was also sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances concerning the commission of rape during the murders. See Berryhill v. State, 249 Ga. 442, 450-451 (11) (291 SE2d 685) (1982) (noting that the jury properly reconsiders all of the evidence from the guilt\/innocence phase in the sentencing phase). This same standard, which concerns the sufficiency of the evidence when reviewed on appeal, applies to Martin\u2019s claim here, which is essentially a claim that the trial court erred by not granting a directed verdict regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance at issue. See Miller v. State, 270 Ga. 741, 742 (1) (512 SE2d 272) (1999) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that the standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as the standard for a motion to dismissholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdict & \n\nAfter discussing these and other findings by Dr. Scardigli, the ALJ sweepingly concluded: In reviewing the record in its entirely, we find that the opinion of Dr. Scardigli that Mr. Schonewolf was unable to work is inconsistent with her narrative and clinical findings. (R. 16.) This is hardly an explanation as to why Dr. Scardigli\u2019s opinion is unreliable, as the ALJ never even attempts to explain why Dr. Scardigli\u2019s conclusions are inconsistent with her own findings. The ALJ has no basis for concluding that his interpretation of Dr. Scardigli\u2019s findings is valid while her own conclusions are unreliable; or if he has such a basis, he never discusses it in his opinion. The ALJ, therefore, invalidly substitutes his medical conclusions for those of the physician. Kent, 710 F.2d at 115 (<HOLDING>). The ALJ\u2019s dismissal of Dr. Scardigli\u2019s holding that the corroborating evidence need not be medical evidence if the appellant explains why medical evidence is not availableholding that an aljs own medical analysis which is contrary to medical evidence is invalidholding that review of medical history during an examination assisted doctors medical conclusionsrecognizing that prison officials should defer to medical professionals on medical mattersholding that plaintiffs claim that medical providers did not comply with baker act was not subject to medical malpractice statutes ajlthough a medical diagnosis is necessary in order to involuntarily commit a patient the process of complying with the statute does not require medical skill or judgment & \n\nvery matter on which he proposes to give an opinion.\u201d Gammill v. Jack Williams Chevrolet, Inc., 972 S.W.2d 713, 718 (Tex.1998). Paragraph six of Dr. Katz\u2019s affidavit states, in pertinent part, that, when an anesthesiologist renders anesthesia services, whether on call or during the regular workday, \u201cit is our practice to charge for those services.\u201d The testimony in paragraph nine states that Dr. Riddle became responsible for S.D. when he assumed the care of Mrs. Chau. As such, he was entitled to compensation for intubat-ing S.D. after birth. While Dr. Katz purported to have personal knowledge of the facts recited in his affidavit, his statement regarding Dr. Riddle\u2019s entitlement to compensation is a legal conclusion with no supporting facts or rationale. See McIntyre, 109 S.W.3d at 749 (<HOLDING>). Dr. Katz\u2019s affidavit makes no claims that, holding there was no general jurisdiction when there was no evidence that defendants advertised or promoted their goods or services in texas solicited business in texas sold their goods or services to a texas entity established a general business office or general business presence in texas or targeted texas marketsholding that where patients expert witness did not testify to what degree of skill and learning ordinarily possessed by doctors in good standing in little rock or similar locales was patient failed to establish applicable standard of care thereby warranting directed verdict in favor of appellant doctorholding expert testimony is ordinarily required in legal malpractice cases to establish the standard of careholding that maryland doctor not qualified to testify about whats ordinarily billed or what the law ordinarily allows people to recover for their medical services in the state of texasholding that plaintiffs are ordinarily entitled to instructions consonant with their theory of the case where evidentiary support for the theory exists & \n\nthe party agreed to do so.\u201d And in AT&T Mobility v.

This, the court believes, is precisely what the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception encompasses. 10 . Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\nIowa Division of Criminal Investigation. 297 F.3d at 703.

After reviewing Horizon\u2019s allegations in this case, we conclude that the remedies, rights, and facts Horizon alleges in this case are not inconsistent with the remedies, rights, and facts Horizon alleged in the English suit. In addition, to the extent there is any inconsistency, it is not so unconscionable, dishonest, contrary to fair dealing, or so stultifying to the legal process or trifling with justice as to be manifestly unjust.

LaMarque, 2006 WL 2411441 holding that states improper use of defendants postmiranda silence was error but did not warrant habeas relief unless error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jurys verdictholding that a substantial right is affected when the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdictholding that an error must have a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict to entitle a petitioner to habeas reliefholding that mental health evidence could be mitigating at the penalty phase even though it is insufficient to establish a legal defense to conviction in the guilty phaseholding that for habeas relief to be granted based on constitutional error in capital penalty phase error must have had substantial and injurious effect on the jurys verdict in the penalty phase & \n\n113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). The Brecht rule applies even when the \u201cfederal habeas court is the first to review for harmless error.\u201d Gilliam v. Mitchell, 179 F.3d 990, 995 (6th Cir.1999). Under Brecht, a Doyle error only warrants reversal if the mistake \u201chad substantial or injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637,113 S.Ct. 1710. A \u201creasonable possibility\u201d that the error influenced the outcome is not enough to warrant relief. Id. Rather, the defendant must show a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that the error af fected the verdict. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995). The present case is not distinguishable on its facts from Brecht, 507 U.S. at 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (<HOLDING>). There is no reasonable probability that holding that an error must have a substantial and injurious effect on the verdict to entitle a petitioner to habeas reliefholding that states improper use of defendants postmiranda silence was error but did not warrant habeas relief unless error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jurys verdictholding that nonconstitutional error is harmless if it did not have substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdictholding that a substantial right is affected when the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdictholding that the states improper use of the defendants postmiranda silence to impeach the defendants claim that shooting was accidental did not have substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining jurys verdict and thus was harmless error & \n\nProcedure \u00a7 26.3c, at 1219-25 (4th ed. 1998). 12 . In Dale, we added that \"[cjircuit precedent suggests that habeas prejudice may require a greater showing, namely, 'by a preponderance of the evidence, that the outcome of his trial would have been different but for the errors in question.\u2019\u201d 140 F.3d at 1056 n. 3 (quoting United States v. Saro, 24 F.3d 283, 287 (D.C.Cir.1994)) (emphasis in Dale); cf. Frady, 456 U.S. at 174, 102 S.Ct. 1584 (rejecting as insufficient to support a colla (stating that the omission of an element from a jury instruction would not be deemed harmless on direct review if \"the defendant contested the omitted element and raised evidence sufficient to support a contrary finding\u201d); Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637-39, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (<HOLDING>) (quoting Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. holding the error harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that nonconstitutional error is harmless if it did not have substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jurys verdictholding improperly admitted evidence was harmless error given the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that error from the erroneous admission of evidence was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendants guiltholding on habeas review that a constitutional trial error did not substantially influence the jurys verdict and hence was harmless where the states evidence of guilt was if not overwhelming certainly weighty & \n\ncourt harmless. The district court stated that although the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cwould have no impact upon the [c]ourt\u2019s sentencing decision,\u201d it would impact the court\u2019s decision if \u201cthe Supreme Court later determine[d] that Blakely [v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)] extends to federal sentencing.\u201d As mentioned above, the special verdict indicated that Soreide was responsible for $7 million to $20 million in actual loss and more than $20 million in intended loss, and that he participated as an organizer or leader. Because these jury findings were identical to those made by the sentencing judge and because they would be applied upon resentencing, any constitutional error was harmless. See United States v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). As for Soreide\u2019s claim of statutory Booker holding that in order to conclude that federal constitutional error is harmless court must find that error harmless beyond a reasonable doubtholding a constitutional booker error harmless on the ground that because the district court stated its sentence would be the same even if the guidelines were only advisory we know with certainty beyond a reasonable doubt what the district court would do upon remandholding that apprendi error is harmless if the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the result would have been the same absent the error internal quotation marks and citation omittedholding that booker constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because on remand the district court would have given defendant the same sentenceholding that before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt & \n\nhabeas federal district court failed to consider the substance of the statutory defense coded at ... \u00a7 25 ... when [it] deferred to the state [court\u2019s] ... dismissal .... \u201d); and 3 (\u201cThe federal district court[\u2019s] procedural ruling erred in determining that the State courts had made an \u2018adequate\u2019 determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d). We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nof his actual innocence. Accordingly, the court will deny claim six as procedurally barred. F. Claim Seven: Post-conviction Proceedings Violated Petitioner\u2019s Due Process And Equal Protection Rights In his seventh claim, petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance of his post-conviction appeal violated his right to equal protection and due process. He complains that the State Supreme Court failed to give a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of his Massiah claims. The court concludes that this claim alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas relief, because petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware State Courts\u2019 analysis in a state collateral proceeding. See Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir.1998)(<HOLDING>)(emphasis in original); see also Lambert v. holding habeas petitioners may show cause for such default in specific circumstances in states that require petitioners to raise iatc claims in initial state habeas proceedings rather than on direct appealholding that the federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioners conviction what occurred in the petitioners collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas proceedingholding federal habeas proceeding was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies when petitioners direct appeal from resentencing was still pending in state court at the time he sought habeas reliefholding that once federal jurisdiction has attached it is not defeated by the petitioners release prior to completion of the proceedings on his habeas applicationholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nIf the defendant perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law is satisfied, and only if the defendant is aware that his death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing. Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it. See Garrett v. Collins, 951 F.2d 57, 59 (5th Cir.1992) and Lowenfield v. Butler, 843 F.2d 183, 187 (5th Cir.1988) (both quoting and relying on this excerpt from Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in Ford, 477 U.S. at 422, 106 S.Ct. 2595 (Powell, J., concurring), in denying competency-to-be-executed habeas relief); see also Fearance, 56 F.3d at 640 and Barnard, 13 F.3d at 876 n. 2 (<HOLDING>). Counsel for Panetti suggests this Court holding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the standard for determining competency to plead guilty is whether the defendant has a rational understanding of the proceedingsholding that the fifth circuit has adopted the powell concurrence as the standard for competency to be executedholding that no exception to the invited error doctrine has ever been adopted by this circuitholding competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving right to counsel is same as competency standard for standing trial and disapproving contrary holding of masthers & \n\nabuse of discretion. VI. Finally, the failure to give eyewitness identification instructions was not harmless. To reiterate, the State lacked any evidence directly connecting Cabinatan to the charged offenses. The testimony of Kincaid was in some respects inconsistent with the police report she filled out before viewing Cabina-tan. Also, her identification was the result of the inherently suggestive environment of a police showup. Cabinatan presented alibi evidence that indicated that he was not present when the thefts occurred. Hence, there was a reasonable possibility that the absence of eyewitness instructions caused the jury to place undue weight on Kincaid\u2019s testimony; thus contributing to Cabinatan\u2019s conviction. See State v. Pauline, 100 Hawai'i 356, 378, 60 P.3d 306, 328 (2002) (<HOLDING>) (internal quotation marks omitted). Absent holding that error is considered harmless if it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict or alternatively stated that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the convictionholding that the harmless error test places a burden on the state to prove that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict or alternatively stated that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the convictionholding that under the harmless error standard an appellate court must determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have contributed to the convictionholding that harmless error test is satisfied when there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the convictionholding that an error is harmless if there is no reasonable possibility that it contributed to the conviction & \n\nwithout their permission. Bums Librarian O'Neill states in his affidavit that \"[h]ad the assurances of confidentiality not been made, it is doubtful that any paramilitary would have participated in this oral history project. Their stories would have died with them, and an opportunity to document and preserve a critical part of the historical record would have been lost forever.\u201d 27 . Appellants\u2019 intervention complaint raised the same claims as their separate civil complaint. We have affirmed that there is no cause of action under the treaty and under the Constitution, so there is no need for us to consider whether the district court acted within its discretion in denying appellants' motion to intervene. Cf. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 708 F.2d 1571, 1575 (11th Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). 28 . Appellants also claim that the Attorney holding that sentencing error is harmless if the error did not affect the district courts selection of the sentence imposedholding that a denial of qualified immunity on the law is collateral to the merits of the underlying action and is therefore considered final for appellate purposesholding that the district courts error was however harmless in light of other considerationsholding that the district courts error in calculating the amount of drugs at issue was harmless because the error had no impact on the defendants sentenceholding that the district courts denial of a petition to intervene was harmless error because the merits of the appellants claim were eventually considered on appeal & \n\nbased upon legally sufficient evidence. To the extent that Moye is claiming that the verdicts were against the \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d under People v. Bleakley, 69 N.Y.2d 490, 495, 515 N.Y.S.2d 761, 508 N.E.2d 672 (N.Y.1987) (citations omitted), such an argument raised only-issues of New York state law and accordingly cannot provide a basis for habeas relief, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (permitting federal habeas corpus review only where the petitioner has alleged that he is in state custody in violation of \u201cthe Constitution or a federal law or treaty\u201d). Federal courts routinely dismiss claims attacking a verdict as against the weight of the evidence on the basis that they are not federal constitutional issues cognizable in a habeas proceeding. Ex parte Craig, 282 F. 138, 148 (2d Cir.1922) (<HOLDING>), aff'd, 263 U.S. 255, 44 S.Ct. 103, 68 L.Ed. holding that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to review the weight of evidence holding that a petition for review is an adequate substitute for habeas corpusholding that threeyear statute of limitations was not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpusholding a court cannot issue and make returnable to it a writ of habeas corpus if the petitioner is outside the courts authorityholding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpus & \n\ncannot remember from one moment to the next what has previously transpired in the proceeding can not fairly preside over the cause. It is the intuitive recognition of this precept that frequently generates alarm among the parties when a substitution of judges occurs during or immediately after trial. Thus, a judge\u2019s recollection of previous proceedings in the cause cannot be characterized as \u201ctestimony.\u201d Third, Tyler dealt with a hearing on a writ of habeas corpus which rests directly upon a constitutional foundation. Here, the trial judge was presiding over a motion for new trial derived from rules of appellate procedure. See Tex.R.App. P. 21.1\u201421.9; see also Phynes v. State, 828 S.W.2d 1, 2 (Tex.Crim.App.1992); Fuentes v. State, 960 S.W.2d 926, 927 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 1998, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). Thus, any constitutional error occurring here holding that there is no federal or colorado constitutional right to postconviction counsel but there is a limited statutory rightrecognizing tjhere is no general constitutional right to discovery in a criminal caseholding that it is well settled that there is no constitutional right to an appealholding that there is no federal constitutional right to a bifurcated criminal trialholding that there is no constitutional right to appeal a criminal conviction & \n\nwith respect to prejudice.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770) (second alteration in original). The error at issue in this case is the lack of congruence or consistency between, on the one hand, the crime as charged in the indictment and found by the jury and, on the other, the crime for which the defendant was sentenced. It is thus possible to view the consequences of this error in one of two ways: either the defendant was improperly sentenced to a greater penalty than the one authorized by Congress for the crime of which he was justly convicted, or the defendant was improperly convicted, because the crime.of conviction was not fully alleged in the indictment and found by the jury. Compare United States v. Promise, 255 F.3d 150, 160 (4th Cir.2001) (en banc) (<HOLDING>), petition for cert. filed, No. 01-6398 (Sept. holding that error in method by which interest from damages award was calculated was an error in substantive law not a clerical or mathematical errorholding that sentencing error is harmless if the error did not affect the district courts selection of the sentence imposedholding at the governments urging that a similar error was an error in sentencingholding that any error was harmless and thus not plain errorholding that district court error was not clear error in denying petition for mandamus & \n\nshow that (1) trial counsel\u2019s representation was so deficient that it fell below the objective standard of professional norms and (2) but for counsel\u2019s error, th ceedings would have been different if counsel would have objected to the jury charge and the trial court had given the reasonable-doubt instruction for extraneous offenses. exual assault of a child case. Since Dowthitt, two unpublished appellate court opinions regarding sexual assault of a child relied on Dowthitt to admit videotaped testimony as prior consistent statements under rule 801(e)(1)(B), when the child-victim testified at trial and the videotaped statement was offered to rebut an express or implied charge of recent fabrication 1569537 at *1 (Tex.App.-Dallas Nov.20, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (<HOLDING>). 8 . During the closing argument at holding that error from the erroneous admission of evidence was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendants guiltholding the error harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding improperly admitted evidence was harmless error given the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that trial courts error in failing to sua sponte give instruction was harmless because state did not emphasize this evidence in closing argument and evidence of appellants guilt was otherwise overwhelmingholding that in admitting evidence the failure of the trial court to give a limiting instruction sua sponte is not reversible error & \n\n113 S.Ct. 1770; Akpan, 407 F.3d at 377, 2005 WL 852416, at *12; United States v. Munoz, 150 F.3d 401, 413 (5th Cir.1998). Consequently, an error is deemed harmless if it did not affect the outcome of the district court proceedings. Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770; Akpan, 407 F.3d at 377, 2005 WL 852416, at *12; Munoz, 150 F.3d at 413. The government bears the burden of showing that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (noting that the inquiry to determine prejudice is the same between plain error and harmless error, but that the defendant, rather than the government, bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice under plain-error review); Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967) (<HOLDING>); Akpan, 407 F.3d at 377, 2005 WL 852416, at holding that in order to conclude that federal constitutional error is harmless court must find that error harmless beyond a reasonable doubtholding that before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubtholding constitutional error may be harmless if court can declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt quoting state v napeahi 57 haw 365 373 556 p2d 569 574 1976holding that before an error can be held harmless the reviewing court must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the defendants convictionholding that a constitutional error is harmless where it can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained & \n\navailable only if the violation of state law \u201craises federal constitutional problems.\u201d Wilcox v. Ford, 813 F.2d 1140, 1145 n.7 (11th Cir.1987). Thus, whether or not the state court erred under Alabama law in its rulings at Davis\u2019 trial is \u201clargely beside the point\u201d in the court\u2019s analysis. Jammed v. Van de Kamp, 926 F.2d 918, 920 (9th Cir.1991). IV. DISCUSSION Davis seeks habeas corpus relief as to his sentence of death based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Roper, supra, and the court addresses this claim first. Davis also has raised and briefed six constitutional guilt-phase claims attacking the validity of his judgment of conviction which the court will address in the order in which the claims are asserted by Davis. See Clisby v. Jones, 960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). A. Davis\u2019Sentence of Death This case no holding that district court must resolve all claims for relief premised on alleged constitutional violations which are raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus whether habeas relief is granted or deniedholding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that a petition for review is an adequate substitute for habeas corpusholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state lawholding that habeas claim not included in petition and never raised by petitioner before the district court as basis for habeas relief is procedurally defaulted & \n\njurisprudence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management Sys., Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1744, 188 L.Ed.2d 829 (2014) and Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1749, 188 L.Ed.2d 816 (2014). Those decisions call into ques tion our two-part test for determining willfulness, In re Seagate Tech., LLC, 497 F.3d 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007) (en banc), and our de novo standard for reviewing the district court\u2019s willfulness determination, Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc., 682 F.3d 1003, 1006-07 (Fed.Cir.2012) (Bard II). See Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 769 F.3d 1371, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2014) (O\u2019Malley, J., concurring). This case demonstrates why de no t. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (<HOLDING>). It would also be consistent with the standard holding habeas corpus is not a civil action for purposes of the equal access to justice act provision for award of attorney fees to prevailing partyholding abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing determinations of whether a litigants position is substantially justified for purposes of feeshifting under the equal access to justice act although the determination frequently turns on a purely legal issueholding that the standard of review under rule 60 is abuse of discretionholding that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretionholding abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing award of attorney fees in patent cases although questions of law may in some cases be relevant & \n\nhave shown that he signed in at his housing unit before proceeding to the canteen; therefore, it would have rebutted the librarian\u2019s statement that Mitchell was at the canteen instead of checking in at his assigned housing unit. Due process requires a DHO to produce and review evidence alleged by a prisoner to be supportive of his defense unless do ing so would be \u201cunduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.\u201d Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. 2963; Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 487 F.3d 808, 813-14 (10th Cir.2007). But assuming, without deciding, that the DHO in this case committed error by refusing to consider the work-crew log, the error was harmless to Mitchell and therefore cannot form the basis of a due process claim. See Howard, 487 F.3d at 814-15 & n. 5 (<HOLDING>); of. Grossman v. Bruce, 447 F.3d 801, 805 holding that error will not be presumed from a silent record and that without the relevant transcript there is insufficient evidence to review the alleged error and the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating the alleged error in the recordrecognizing that a dhos unjustified refusal to review a videotape alleged to be exculpatory might constitute harmless error and remanding to the district court to make a determination of harmlessness on a fuller factual recordholding that the district courts review of a partial and truncated record was error and remanding the case for review on the entire administrative recordholding that the district court did not have jurisdiction and remanding the matter to state courtholding that chapman harmless error review will be conducted when error is tested for harmlessness for the first time on habeas & \n\nare you aware of whether or not Eligi\u00f3 [Saenz] has any other method of getting to a public roadway, other than through Mrs. Thrash\u2019s property and through your property? A. He\u2019s even going through my, my easement that I bought outright several times, and also through the ranch, through other places. [Emphasis added] Q. Through what other places sir? A. Through mine and Bazans and Manuel Reyes too. He\u2019s been using it, not right now because he locked the gates. [Emphasis added] Xavier Reyes\u2019 testimony raises a genuine issue of material fact on whether the Saenzes have other possible legal means of access to their property and on whether access across the Reyeses\u2019 property is a necessity, as opposed to a mere convenience. See Mitchell v. Castellaw, 151 Tex. 56, 246 S.W.2d 163, 168 (1952) (<HOLDING>). CONCLUSION We conclude the Saenzes failed to holding it is a question of factholding that whether the defendants confession was voluntary was a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo reviewholding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that probable cause determination presents a mixed question of law and factholding the question of necessity is one of mixed law and fact and accordingly one for the fact finder in the ordinary case & \n\nclaims are defaulted, but Louisiana prisoners can benefit from the Martinez\/Trevino exception to the procedural-default, rule if they can show that they have a substantial IATC claim and received IAC from state habeas counsel. As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v.

The other mootness exception concerns issues that raise considerations of substantial public interest which, if addressed, would prevent future litigation.

That said, the precedents shed some light on the government\u2019s obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v.

Michaud herself testified as to her condition, that is, that both her blood pressure and blood sugar level increased and that Guarilia\u2019s treatment depressed her.

These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit. This case is, thus, distinguishable from those in which courts declined to dismiss claims recognized under New Jersey local law, even though out-of-state plaintiffs might have been unable to pursue such causes of action under their own state\u2019s local law. In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree.

Courts agree that a \u201cmarket\u201d rate of interest should apply. See Koopmans, 102 F.3d at 874-75; In re Smithwick, 121 F.3d at 214; In re Valenti, 105 F.3d at 63; GMAC, 999 F.2d at 66-67; United Carolina Bank, 993 F.2d at 1129-30; In re Fowler, 903 F.2d 694, 697 (9th Cir.1990); In re Hardzog, 901 F.2d at 859-60; Arnold, 878 F.2d at 927-28; see also Pearson, supra at 40-41; Epstein, supra at 443. There is disagreement, however, about what rate of interest will adequately ensure that the creditor receives full value of his secured claim. 1. Under one approach, known as the \u201ccost of funds method,\u201d the interest rate is set at the rate the creditor would have to pay to borrow the amount equal to the collateral\u2019s value. See In re Valenti 105 F.3d at 64 (<HOLDING>); 8 Lawrence P. King et al., Collier on holding that although cost of funds approach more appropriately reflects the present value of a creditors allowed claim it is difficult to administer and therefore the interest rate should be fixed at the rate on a united states treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtors reorganization planholding that bankruptcy plan of reorganization rather than 1961 controlled the setting of the interest rateholding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that the proper rate for prejudgment interest is the rate fixed by the parties in a contract & \n\ndate. Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim. The Walker court noted that Rule 9 was inapplicable, and held that \u201cit is enough in pleading a conspiracy to merely indicate the parties, general purpose, and approximate date, so that the defendant has notice of what he is charged with.\u201d Id. The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy. Walker, 288 F.3d at 1007; see also, Hoskins v. Poelstra, 320 F.3d 761, 764 (7th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). The other cases cited by Sanchez are also holding that more than notice to a defendant is requiredholding that a complaint under section 1983 must contain more than naked improbable unsubstantiated assertions without any specificsholding that a person alleging a conspiracy to violate constitutional rights must do more than simply aver that a conspiracy existedholding that complaint alleging a conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his civil rights cannot survive motion to dismiss based on conclusory allegations of conspiracy which are not supported by references to material factsrecognizing that ryan cannot be read to require that a complaint alleging conspiracy under 1983 contain more than notice of time scope and parties involved & \n\nwhether the risk of a conflict colored the defendant\u2019s representation, but only when the potential conflict is brought to the court\u2019s attention. Bare allegations of a conflict are not enough. See People v. Williams, 139 Ill. 2d 1, 12 (1990). \u201cIn the absence of an evidentiary record of conflict, one should not be created based on mere speculation.\u201d Banks, 121 Ill. 2d at 46-47 (Clark, C.J., specially concurring, joined by Ward, Ryan, and Miller, JJ.). The appellate court here held that \u201ca trial court\u2019s duty to investigate arises only if, at an early stage in the proceedings, a defendant presents facts suggesting a conflict that goes beyond the problem of one public defender having to attack another.\u201d 353 Ill. App. 3d at 527; accord People v. Jones, 210 Ill. App. 3d 375, 378 (1991) (<HOLDING>). We agree with the appellate court, but recognizing the conflictholding counsel must only provide relevant facts of the crimerecognizing conflictholding that the defendant must provide facts to establish what the conflict washolding that the public disclosure must reveal both the true state of facts and that the defendant represented the facts to be something other than what they were & \n\nnot dealing with what the law calls sexual penetration. He admits to Detective Herrick that she was defending herself. He says that his fingers may have gone in her vagina.

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>). To determine what constitutes a violent crime holding that the statutory definition of motor vehicle is not controllingholding that the guidelines definition of consolidated offenses was not applicable to a statutory minimum sentence imposed under 841holding that court must look to statutory definition of acc a predicate offensesholding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16holding that in determining whether a prior conviction is a violent felony a court generally must look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense & \n\nArticle Two analogue to 9-307.\u201d). In other jurisdictions, then, the present case would likely be resolved in favor of the Hattens and Pralles as buyers in the ordinary course of business, either under section 9-307 or section 2-403. Cases from other states are instructive because the UCC and Minnesota\u2019s car titling act (based on the Uniform Motor Vehicle Certificate of Title and Anti-Theft Act) are uniform laws. See Minn. Stat. \u00a7 645.22 (1992) (\u201cLaws uniform with those of other states shall be interpreted and construed to effect their general purpose to make uniform the laws of those states which enact them.\u201d). In addition, this view does not conflict with our courts\u2019 prior treatment of the state\u2019s motor vehicle titling statute. See Welle v. Prozinski, 258 N.W.2d 912, 916 (Minn.1977) (<HOLDING>); see also Minn. Stat. \u00a7 168A.05, subd. 6 recognizing that in 1982 kentucky converted to a new title system for motor vehicles under which the secured creditor must perfect its security interest by noting the lien on the certificate of title to the motor vehicleholding that normal presumption of ownership in favor of holder of motor vehicle certificate of title may be rebutted despite language of minnstat 168a10 subd 5 providing that the transfer of a motor vehicle is not effective until titling requirements are complied withholding that assault conviction for driving a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol and causing serious bodily injury to the person of another with the motor vehicle qualified as a crime of violence under ussg 4b12aholding that the sensible and popular understanding of what a motor vehicle accident entails necessarily involves the motor vehicle being operated as a motor vehicle holding that the statutory definition of motor vehicle is not controlling & \n\nor a balance of the conveniences is on the party seeking to proceed with the second action. See First City Nat\u2019l Bank & Trust Co. v. Simmons, 878 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1989). One such special circumstance warranting an exception to the first filed rule occurs when a party files a declaratory judgment action after receiving notice of a planned lawsuit by its adversary. See Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc., 579 F.2d 215, 219 (2d Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 908; 99 S.Ct. 1215, 59 L.Ed.2d 455 (1979) (\u201cWhen the declaratory judgment action has been triggered by a notice letter, this equitable consideration may be a factor in the decision to allow the later filed action to proceed to judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019 chosen forum.\u201d); Federal Insurance Co., 808 F.Supp. at 349-50 (<HOLDING>); Sharimalia Food Corp. v.

Thus, although the court credited Gasser\u2019s testimony at least to the extent that this meeting took place, it failed to draw reasonable inferences in favor of Gasser about what took place during this encounter. Given Gasser\u2019s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome.

Indeed, the \u201cexplanatory statement\u201d prefacing the new Property Registry Facilitation Act indicates that registrar delay has been widespread in Puerto Rico for quite some time without the fault of applicants. See 2010 P.R. Laws No. 216. Moreover, the local statutes give no indication that mere passage of time caused by registrar delay somehow nullifies or expires the filing entry or its priority rank. Cf. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 30, \u00a7 2255 (entry of presentation expires where notified defect is not seasonably corrected). Like the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the creditor in 229 Main Street, Banco Popular obtained a concrete, pre-petition debt owed to it by the property owner.

Third, holding that the moving party bears a heavy burden of proving the facts required for disqualificationholding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that the plaintiff bears the burden of showing that he has standing for each type of relief soughtholding that the trial court must determine whether the contracting agency provided a coherent and reasonable explanation of its exercise of discretion and the disappointed bidder bears a heavy burden of showing that the award decision had no rational basisrecognizing that trial court has broad discretion in ruling on admissibility of evidence and party claiming abuse of that discretion bears a heavy burden & \n\nexisting driveways and curb cuts in light of the statutory change that has affected the plaintiff\u2019s ability to use his deeded easement. This conduct is the functional equivalent of the obstruction or impairment contemplated in Sakansky and Bean. The trial court also found that the deviation proposed by the plaintiff would not unduly burden the defendant. We uphold such findings if they are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. See Batakis v. Town of Belmont, 135 N.H. 595, 597, 607 A.2d 956, 957 (1992). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Under these circumstances, the owner of the dominant estate may deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. Cf. Haley v. Colcord, 59 N.H. 7, 9 (1879) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling holding that an easement is not a separate estate when dominant and servient tracts are under the same ownershipholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estateholding that the burden on the servient estate cannot be increased without the consent of the owners of the servient estate and that the owner of the dominant estate to which the appurtenant easement is attached has no power to convey or expand use of that easement in connection with a tract of land owned by anotherrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that dominant tenant may deviate from path of prescriptive easement to extent reasonably necessary to pass around obstruction created by servient tenant & \n\ncomplaint has been filed and, as such, there is no civil action. Ms. Shepard cites to a number of cases in her brief which support the longstanding rule in North Carolina that the Clerk of Superior Court has original jurisdiction in an estate matter, while the Superior Court Judge has derivative jurisdiction. See, e.g., In re Estate of Parrish, 143 N.C. App. 244, 251, 547 S.E.2d 74, 78 (noting that the estate proceeding at issue \u201cwas not a civil action, but a proceeding concerning an estate matter, which was exclusively within the purview of the Clerk\u2019s jurisdiction, and over which the Superior Court retained appellate, not original, jurisdiction.\u201d) (citations omitted), disc. review denied, 354 N.C. 69, 553 S.E.2d 201 (2001); In re Green, 9 N.C. App. 326, 328, 176 S.E.2d 19, 20 (1970) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, we find the phrase \u201call actions holding that the cause of action under fela vests in the personal representative of the estate not in the beneficiariesholding that the amount of a commission to be awarded to the personal representative requires the exercise of judicial discretion and judgment by the clerk who has original jurisdiction in the matterholding in part that the right of removal is given only to a defendant who has not submitted himself to that jurisdiction not to an original plaintiff in a state court who by resorting to that jurisdiction has become liable under the state laws to a crossactionholding that the commission on remand can set the effective date of a rate to be the effective date of the original commission activityholding that the apparent denial of the husbands request for an order compelling the wife to deliver to him the personal property he had been awarded in their divorce judgment did not constitute a modification of the original divorce judgment & \n\nnoneconomic damage awards. A defendant is liable to a claimant only for the percentage of the damages found by the trier of fact equal to that defendant\u2019s percentage of responsibility unless the percentage of responsibility attributed to the defendant is greater than 50% or the defendant engaged in particular conduct listed in the penal code. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.013(a), (b) (West 2008). Here, the jury found LMS 30% responsible and found Hospital 60% responsible. Based on our above holding that legally insufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s joint enterprise finding and the fact that the jury assessed only 30% responsibility against LMS, LMS cannot be jointly and severally liable with Hospital for the entire judgment. See id.; Able, 35 S.W.3d at 616 (<HOLDING>); Shoemaker, 513 S.W.2d at 14 (same). recognizing as viable actions in tort negligent hiring and negligent retentionrecognizing that each party in a joint enterprise is responsible for the negligent act of the otherholding that the jones act did not operate to make negligent crew members liable to their employers for damages paid to other seamen under the jones act because crew members cannot sue each other for negligenceholding that a clause providing that the insurer has a right to recover damages from a responsible third party referred to a tortfeasor because the use of damages in bodily injury cases means pecuniary compensation resulting from an unlawful or negligent act by a wrongdoerholding that for a plaintiff to recover on claim of negligent hiring the negligent hiring of the employee must have been the proximate cause of the injury at issue & \n\ncancel both the \u201cplain and precise\u201d one-year limitation Congress placed on a former spouse\u2019s right to claim the benefits and the clear prohibition against subjecting an annuity to legal process. Id. (quoting King v. King, 225 Ga. App. 298, 483 S.E.2d 379, 383 (1997)). The Court thus found that the Virginia divorce decree, which would effectively negate this federal one-year limitation, was appropriately overridden by the SBP law because clear and substantial federal interests would \u201csuffer major damage if the state law [were] applied.\u201d Id. at 8, 539 S.E.2d at 725 (quoting Yazell, 382 U.S. at 352). The facts and federal law at issue in the instant case are easily distinguishable on all three of these points. First, FEGLIA does not creat 19 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1137 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (<HOLDING>); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Pearson, 6 F. holding that employee spouses accrued but unvested retirement benefits are a contingent property interest and a community assetholding that feglia preempted a state divorce decree which ordered the insured to maintain his fegli policy for the benefit of his children from his first marriageholding a nonemployee spouse who holds a community pioperty interest in an employee spouses retirement benefits owns a community property interest in the latters iethement benefits as enhanced by eaily xetirement incentivesholding that to the extent that california community property law gave the insureds former spouses or his daughter an interest in his fegli benefits it conflicted with feglias order of precedenceholding that the asserted right of the insureds child based on his agreement with his mother during their divorce to name the child as his fegli beneficiary was preempted by feglia & \n\nwhatever means necessary \u2014 including violence \u2014 to avoid being apprehended; and (2) individuals involved in narcotics trafficking \u2014 which is, by its very nature dangerous\u2014could be present in the warehouse for the purpose of purchasing drug paraphernalia. When these two potential risks are coupled with the fact that the agents believed a fugitive was present in the warehouse, it is clear that the agents possessed the reasonable articulable suspicion required under Buie to conduct a protective security sweep. Further, the layout of the warehouse made a protective sweep particularly appropriate. Scartozzi saw immediately upon entering the warehouse, a building he had never entered before, that inside were long, high rows of stacks of boxes. Cf. Buie, 494 U.S. at 333, 110 S.C .Ed.2d 112 (<HOLDING>). The plain view exception only applies, holding seizure of evidence in plain view reasonable under fourth amendmentholding that the incriminating nature of an item was immediately apparent where the police officers had probable cause to believe that it contained evidence of a crimeholding that the observation of evidence in plain view is not a search for purposes of the fourth amendment and does not require a warrantholding that the fourth amendment permits seizure of property in plain view where 1 the officer has a lawful right to access the object itself and 2 the propertys incriminating character is immediately apparentholding that a seizure was lawful under the plain view doctrine where there was probable cause to associate the property with criminal activity & \n\nclearly states that the precise location of an easement need not be designated for the easement to be valid. See McConnell v. Golden, 104 R.I. 657, 663, 247 A.2d 909, 912 (1968). Instead, the holders of the dominant estate are entitled to a convenient, suitable, and accessible easement of way. Id. Therefore, despite the lack of specificity in the original writing that created the easement, plaintiffs are entitled to the use of \u201ca rear roadway, at least ten feet in width,\u201d to be \u201ckept open so that vehicles can reach the rear of the building [once] known as First National Store Since this language was referenced in defendant\u2019s deed, and because it has not been modified by subsequent instrument, it remains in effect. See Crawford Realty Co. v. Ostrow, 89 R.I. 12, 19, 150 A.2d 5, 9 (1959) (<HOLDING>). There is no question that defendant caused a holding that an express easement ran with the dominant estateholding that increase in vehicular traffic arising out of the subdivision of the dominant estate was reasonably foreseeable and so did not restrict the rights of the dominant ownerrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that the dominant tenement a power company rather than the servient tenement had affirmative duties of inspection and repair related to its easementholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estate & \n\ndid not apply because the wife had failed to file her petition with the clerk until after the sale. 43 Kan. at 596-97. Similarly, in Graham v. Pepple, 129 Kan. 735, 284 Pac. 394 (1930), a wife filed a petition for divorce asking for 53% acres in Washington County as alimony. The husband later sold this land to a third party. The Kansas Supreme Court held the real estate was sufficiently described for purposes of lis pendens because the husband owned only one 53%-acre tract in Washington County: \u201cIf the derelict husband had owned a hundred acres and she had merely laid claim to some undefined portion of it,\u201d there may have been sufficient ambiguity in the description to uphold the transfer to the third party. 129 Kan. at 737; see also Rumsey v. Rumsey, 150 Kan. 49, 90 P.2d 1093 (1939) (<HOLDING>).

See supra. In any event, under this Court\u2019s holding that attorney fee awards are payable to the attorney, not the plaintiff, the awards are the property of the attorney and therefore not subject to offset for the plaintiffs debts. See Marr\u00e9, 117 F.3d at 304 (finding that \u201cthe government cannot set off [the plaintiffs] tax obligations against the attorneys\u2019 fee award, as no mutuality of debt exists between the government and [the plaintiffs] attorneys\u201d). Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel Is Entitled to an Additional Fee Award This Court further finds that the plaintiffs attorney is entitled to an additional fee award under the EAJA for his time spent litigating this issue. See Commissioner, 496 U.S. 154 at 160-161, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (<HOLDING>). The Government recognizes that this Court has holding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that eaja fees may be awarded for fee litigation without a separate finding that the government was not substantially justified in its position as to the fee litigation as the single finding that the governments position lacks substantial justification operates as a onetime threshold for fee eligibility and presumptively encompasses all aspects of the civil actionholding that where a contract for legal services fails to expressly provide for the amount of the fee a reasonable fee is impliedholding that awarded fees were reasonable and that proof that attorneys fees are necessary apart from testimony as to the reasonableness of the fee is not requiredholding that the termination of the fee cap did not affect litigation in progress when the fee cap was in effect & \n\ncourt\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus filed by a non-attorney representative of a Social Security claimant whose fee agreements had been repeatedly denied. 256 F.3d 1044, 1047 (10th Cir.2001). In that case, we found the petitioner had failed to prove that he had exhausted all other avenues of relief because he had not filed a fee petition pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1725. Id. Although the district court below did not address whether the reasons for the ALJ\u2019s disapproval of the fee agreement were entitled to deference, this does not change Cordoba\u2019s requirement that a representative seeking approval of a fee agreement must exhaust all available administrative remedies \u2014 including a fee petition \u2014 before the writ of mandamus may be granted. See also Power, 292 F.3d at 786 (<HOLDING>). In addition, Baker has not shown that the fee recognizing conflict between filing motion to dismiss and fee application and noting postponement of fee application resulted in no prejudice to any partyholding that where a contract for legal services fails to expressly provide for the amount of the fee a reasonable fee is impliedholding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that petitioner had failed to exhaust alternative remedies for review of his fee agreement because the ssa notified petitioner he could obtain his fee by filing a fee petitionholding that the petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his claim involving a procedural error correctable by the bia & \n\nfiled a motion for a new trial on September 16, 2009, which the trial court denied on February 15,2013.

The case was docketed here for the January 2014 term and submitted for decision on the briefs. 2 In addition, OCGA \u00a7 16-3-21 (d) (2), which was enacted in 1993, authorizes relevant expert testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s condition of mind at the time of the offense, including relevant facts and circumstances relating to the family violence or child abuse that are the bases of the expert\u2019s opinion, to support a justification defense in a prosecution for murder or manslaughter.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Pardofigueroa also contends that the district holding guidelines to be only advisoryholding that the preponderance standard is generally appropriate in guidelines sentencingrecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standardholding that the district court determines the amount of loss under the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that under the advisory guidelines a district court should resolve factual disputes at sentencing by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\nAlthough public policy arguments are not resolved by juries, they require that the court understand what happened to a plaintiff, a question only answered after a. judge has heard evidence detailing the circumstances that resulted in an injury.

But Edwards ignored the language of the Guidelines- on \u201cthe scope of the agreement.\u201d The Second Circuit picked up this language and wrote a gloss on it, holding that the latecomer to a conspiracy was liable for drugs earlier distributed, of which he \u201cknew or reasonably should have known.\u201d United States v. Miranda-Ortiz, 926 F.2d 172, 178 (2d Cir.), cert. denied \u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 347, 116 L.Ed.2d 287 (1991). This gloss introduces a kind of negligence standard into conspiracy law. It goes beyond the terms of the . Sentencing Guidelines. Cf. United States v. Navarro, 979 F.2d 786, 789 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). An approach closer to the Guidelines was holding that the district court made sufficient factual findings and adequately determined the scope of defendants participation in a conspiracy under 1b13 even though the district court did not expressly determine the scope of the defendants participationholding that the sentencing court erred in failing to make a factual determination as to the amount of drugs attributable to the defendant after his participation in the charged conspiracyholding that defendant is liable for entire quantity of drugs attributable to conspiracy in circumstances where defendant is one of conspiracys central figuresholding that evidence tending to show knowing participation in the conspiracy is sufficient to sustain conspiracy convictionholding that when a district court determines drug quantity for the purpose of sentencing a defendant convicted of participating in a drugtrafficking conspiracy the court is required to make an individualized finding as to drug amounts attributable to or foreseeable by that defendant & \n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel); Boag v.

However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v.

App. at 391,394, 533 S.E.2d at 560, 562. In this case, defendant\u2019s competence has never been assessed, let alone at a relevant time. Thus, it is clear that a retrospective determination of defendant\u2019s competence would not be possible here and we do not need to remand for the trial court to make such a determination. Because defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial has never been evaluated and \u201c[g]iven the inherent difficulties of such a nunc pro tunc determination under the most favorable circumstances, we cannot conclude that such a procedure would be adequate here.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 183, 43 L.Ed. 2d at 119-20 (citations omitted); see also Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 403, 4 L.Ed. 2d 824, 825 (1960) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s holding that appellant must present some evidence of a subsequent change in competency or some new evidence in a manner analogous to newly discovered evidence in a motion for new trial to complain of a denial of a second competency hearingrecognizing the difficulty of retrospectively determining the defendants competency as of more than a year ago and ordering a new trial and hearing as to the defendants present competenceholding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the state does not have to prove a defendants competency to stand trialholding that a trial court must conduct sua sponte a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendants competence & \n\nof leniency in exchange for testimony is a recognized and established activity of federal prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity. \u201cNo practice is more ingrained in our criminal justice system than the practice of the government calling a witness who is an accessory to the crime for which the defendant is charged and having that witness testify under a plea bargain that promises him a reduced sentence.\u201d United States v. Cervantes-Pacheco, 826 F.2d 310, 315 (5th Cir.1987) (en banc), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1026, 108 S.Ct. 749, 98 L.Ed.2d 762 (1988). This traditional prosecutorial granting of leniency has, throughout history, been sanctioned by the courts as well. See, e.g., United States v. Ford, 99 U.S. 594, 604, 25 L.Ed. 399 (1878) (The Whiskey cases) (<HOLDING>). The case law is replete with instances of holding that a public prosecutor is permitted to induce a witness to fully and fairly testify to the guilt of his associates in exchange for the prosecutors recommendation for executive clemencyholding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that the witness had accepted immunity in exchange for no prosecutionholding that in order to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to call a witness to testify the claimant must allege 1 the identity of the potential witness 2 that the witness was available to testify at trial 3 the substance of the witnesss testimony and 4 an explanation of how the omission of the testimony prejudiced the caseholding that the jury could have reasonably inferred the requisite intent to induce the witness to lie or testify falsely from the defendants statements to the witness & \n\nto go forward, if there is even a fair possibility that the stay for which he prays will work damage to some one else.\u201d Landis, 299 U.S. at 255. How and when a stay is imposed is left to the court\u2019s discretion; in exercising that discretion, a court must \u201c\u2018weigh the competing interests and maintain an even balance,\u201d\u2019 giving due consideration to the interests of the litigants, the court, and the public. Tak Fat Trading Co. v. United States, 24 CIT 1376, 1377, 2000 WL 1825396 at **1 (CIT 2000) (quoting Landis, supra). A stay that fails to properly balance the relevant interests, e.g., a stay \u201cof indefinite duration in the absence of a pressing need,\u201d is likely to be deemed an abuse of discretion. Id. See Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma v. United States, 124 F.3d 1413, 1416 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (<HOLDING>). In this matter, the need for the stay (or, holding that it was an abuse of discretion to deny stay while matter was pending in neighboring staterecognizing that a state courts determination is not an unreasonable application of law merely because it is erroneousholding that trial courts stay was an abuse of discretion because pending actions may take years to complete and because proceedings on liability could not be justifiably stayed merely because a precise determination of damages is not possible at this moment holding that it is an abuse of discretion to dismiss a complaint merely because of the presence of superfluous matterholding that it was an abuse of discretion for a district court not to stay an exhausted petition pending exhaustion of a newly discovered claim & \n\nthe structure of drug trafficking organizations and the role of drug couriers. Cira testified that a drug distributor would not have allowed the quantity of drugs in this case out of his control, and that, in his experience, he had never encountered a courier who did not know what was in his vehicle. Martinez never objected to the admission of Cira\u2019s testimony in district court. Therefore, we review this claim for plain error. See United States v. Jones, 266 F.3d 804, 814 (8th Cir.2001). Relying on Ninth Circuit precedent, Martinez contends admission of the testimony was error because he was not charged with conspiracy to import drugs and no evidence was presented to link him to an actual drug trafficking organization. See United States v. Vallejo, 237 F.3d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Martinez also contends admission of the holding that expert testimony concerning the structure of drug trafficking organizations is inadmissible where the defendant is not charged with a conspiracy to import drugs or where such evidence is not otherwise probative of a matter properly before the courtholding a fiveyear old drug conviction is probative of a defendants state of mind in a drug conspiracy caseholding that the district court committed prejudicial error in admitting expert testimony about the structure of drug trafficking organizations because the testimony portrayed the defendant as a member of such an organization and implied the defendant knew the drugs were in his vehicleholding that expert testimony regarding the structure of drug trafficking organizations was inadmissible in a nonconspiracy importation caseholding that the district court complied with the requirements of lb13alb where it made specific references to testimony in the record relating to the scope of the defendants involvement in the drug trafficking conspiracy noted that the relevant testimony was unrefuted and stated that the testimony was internally consistent & \n\nany mention during cross examination of his dishonorable discharge from the Marines. The court granted defendant's motion. Despite the ruling, the State's attorney asked a question about the circumstances of his leaving the Marines and he replied, \"I deserted.\" State v. Smith, supra at 427. Defendant did not object to the question, did not move to instruct the jury to disregard the answer, and did not move to strike the answer. The Supreme Court held that defendant's motion to exclude the evidence was sufficient to preserve the error for appeal, concluded the error was prejudicial and ordered a new trial. As Smith demonstrates, a ruling on a motion to exclude evidence is not necessarily merely advisory and tentative. Accord, State v. Brooks, 20 Wn. App. 52, 59-60, 579 P.2d 961 (1978) (<HOLDING>) (citing State v. Smith, supra). If such a holding that although a defendant filed a motion in limine on an evidentiary issue a failure to object to the evidence at trial waives the issue for appealholding that a defendants failure to object or join in a codefendants objection to an issue bars the defendant from raising the issue on appealholding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that failure to object does not preclude raising the issue on appeal where erroneous evidence is offered in violation of an order in limine & \n\nbeing discharged. See NRDC v. EPA 822 F.2d 104,108.

This permit, known as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d> permit, establishes enforceable effluent limitations, as well as monitoring and reporting requirements.

CONCLUSION \u00b6 21 For these reasons, we vacate the superior court\u2019s order granting Progressive\u2019s motion and dismissing the complaint. This matter is remanded for further proceedings. CONCURRING: PATRICIA K. NORRIS, Presiding Judge and PATRICIA A. OROZCO, Judge. 1 . The complaint names George Pop as the defendant. Duncan has not amended the complaint to substitute the Estate of George Pop for George Pop. Progressive, however, has not contested the propriety of the complaint and it has proceeded as though the Estate of Pop is a named defendant. Accordingly, for purposes of this decision, we assume that the complaint is sufficient as against Pop's estate. See Pargman v. Vickers, 208 Ariz. 573, 575, \u00b64, 96 P.3d 571, 573 (App.2004) (<HOLDING>); Ariz. R. Civ.

All of this is to say that, even if we did not have the benefit of New Jersey state court decisions and were completely left to our own devices, the question of whether Rifiee and Madamba could be liable under LAD \u00a7 10:5-12(a) is, as the majority acknowledges, a close one. Maj. Op. at 125. But see Tyson v. CIGNA Corp., 918 F.Supp. 836, 839 (D.N.J.1996) (<HOLDING>). In matters involving state law, however, our holding professional rules do not provide basis for civil liabilityholding that there is no individual liability under title viiholding no individual liability under the adeaholding that fmla does not impose individual liabilityholding that 10512a does not provide for individual liability because it does not include any of the phrases that so clearly provide a basis for individual liability under other subparts of lad & \n\n2013 WL 98059, at *1 (W.D.Ky.

Federal law on bifurcation for bad faith claims against insurers does not support Arrowood\u2019s argument for separate trials. Federal courts sometimes bifurcate trials of underlying liability claims and bad faith claims, but only when the liability claims are still unresolved. See, e.g., Warren v. Federal Ins. Co., 358 Fed.Appx. 670, 676 (6th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). There is no pending contract claim here.

The application of strict liability for ul-trahazardous activities appears to be rather limited in Tennessee, as it is in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., Ergon, Inc. v. Amoco Oil Co., 966 F.Supp. 577, 583 (W.D.Tenn.1997) (noting that Tennessee courts reject the application of strict liability to gas suppliers for escaping gas, even though gas is poisonous, dangerous, and highly explosive, and holding that defendants with escaping petroleum products also should not merit strict liability).

Moreover, she did not have to reach the question whether the media defendants\u2019 actions were protected by a common law privilege for reporting official actions in the District.

It is important to emphasize that we are taking no position on the question whether, in this context, expert testimony would be required if a party raised the point. We note, however, that there is nothing to prevent a person who acted in or observed the transactions or occurrences at issue from testifying as an expert on the applicable standard of care. See Adkins v. Morton, 494 A.2d 652, 656-57 (D.C.1985) (<HOLDING>). 19 .

What I\u2019m exceeded the bounds of its discretion when it, in effect, treated Ruperd\u2019s failure to appear as a waiver of his right to a hearing on his motion to suppress. The state contends that the district court never ruled on whether Ruperd was entitled to another hearing on his motion because Ruperd never brought another notice of hearing for the district court to deny. However, as we have previously noted, the district court unequivocally stated to Ruperd and his counsel on multiple occasions that the motion to suppress would not be reheard because Ruperd failed to appear, not because it was waiting for counsel to file a notice of hearing. The law does not require the doing of a useless thing. See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 777 F.2d 543, 554 (10th Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). We, consequently, conclude Ruperd was not holding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that the court correctly denied a mistrial when the statement that the witness saw the defendant when the defendant was signing in as a condition of bail was brief and added nothing to the governments caseholding that the defendants due process rights were violated when the trial judge singled out the only defense witness and indicated to that witness that he expected the witness to he and would personally ensure that the witness was prosecuted for perjury and thereby effectively drove that witness off the standholding that in order to show unavailability of a witness service of process by the defendant was not required when the witness had jumped bail and fledholding that death of potential alibi witness did not cause actual prejudice because defendant failed to relate the substance of the testimony of the missing witness in sufficient detail and to show witness testimony not available from other sources & \n\ndeclined to provide a breath sample. At some point during or after the booking process, appellant complained of chest and wrist pain, so the police called for an ambulance. The trial court found appellant guilty of DWI, and this appeal followed. Sufficiency of the Evidence In his sole issue, appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his DWI conviction. A. Standard of Review When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational fact finder could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); Adames v. State, 353 S.W.3d 854, 859 (Tex.Crim.App.2011) (<HOLDING>). Our review of \u201call of the evidence\u201d includes holding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that appellate court could not review the sufficiency of the evidence based on a particular legal standard because that standard was not submitted to the jury and no party objected to the charge on this ground or requested that the jury be charged using this standardholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdictholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\n"}

If Plaintiffs are able to show fraud on the part of First Boston, it might be held liable for all or part of the claim against BMC, even though it would not be liable for the particular relief sought. The power to implead First Boston based on its fraud as an agent of BMC should not be limited by the form of the remedy requested in the Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint, especially when, as here, the relief sought is a lump sum of $30,000,000 minus the value of the Notes.

While a construction of the statute to impose individual liability on an agent is facially plausible, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of this agent provision was to incorporate respondeat superior liability into the statute.\u201d Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s Int'l Inc., 991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir.1993) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while a supervisory employee may be joined as a party defendant in a Title VII action, that employee must be viewed as being sued in his capacity as the agent of the employer, who is alone hable for a violation of Title VII. See Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>).

Where those acts of infringement occur within the United States and a plaintiff seeks to hold a foreign defendant contributorily or vicariously liable for those acts, it has been held that subject matter jurisdiction may exist, and that the exercise thereof does not conflict with the doctrine of nonextraterri-toriality.

As stated in Anderson: A person need not be an officer, director, employee, or shareholder of a company to be held accountable as a responsible person. The test is whether the person had control of the disbursements of the taxpayer, that is, whether \u2018he had the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid, and when.\u2019 It is not necessary that such control be exercised exclusively by the person; it may be exercised jointly with others. Id., 561 F.2d at 165 (citations omitted; emphasis added).

In evaluating these arguments, two things must be kept in mind. First, while in-person telemarketing calls may be harassing to the consumer, they do not violate the TCPA. It is only when the calls are \u201crobo-calls\u201d or are made to persons on the do-not-call list that the calls violate the Act. Accordingly, assisting a party in setting up telemarketing centers or providing scripts for in-person calls is not evidence of agency.

Individual Liability Wilson alleges claims of race discrimination pursuant to Title VII, the ELCRA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against Budco and Raymond. As Wilson conceded during a hearing on the motion, an individual who does not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d is not subject to individual liability under Title VII. Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe now hold that an individual employee\/supervisor, who does not otherwise qualify as an \u2018employer\u2019 may not be held personally liable under Title VIL\u201d). Individual liability may, however, be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 1981 and the ELCRA. See Whidbee v.

Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla.

Arranging for disposal of hazardous substances, in itself, is neither regulated under nor prohibited by CERCLA. Further, disposal activities that were legal when conducted can nevertheless give rise to liability under \u00a7 9607(a)(3) if there is an actual or threatened release of such hazardous substances into the environment.

Cucinotti next contends that the trial court erred in holding him personally liable. He points out that Reliance rested its theory of personal liability on several grounds, each of which was essentially abandoned in favor of the participation theory as articulated by the Supreme Court in its decision in Saltiel v. GSI Consultants, Inc., 170 N.J. 297, 788 A.2d 268 (2002), a decision released while the Reliance summary judgment motion was pending. While there are other reported decisions that hold that corporate officers who participate in fraud or conversion can be held personally liable for the losses occasioned thereby, see, e.g., Charles Bloom & Co. v. Echo Jewelers, 279 N.J.Super. 372, 382, 652 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.l995)(<HOLDING>); Robsac Indus., Inc. v.

Although all three statutes provide that a supervisor is an employer, a number of courts have held that Congress included the phrase \u201cany agent\u201d to make sure that respondeat superior liability was imposed on the employers for the acts committed by their agents, not upon the agents personally. Id. at 50-51. Accordingly, Plaintiffs ADA claims against the Individual Defendants are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. B. TITLE VII CLAIMS AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS The First Circuit has held that there is no individual employee liability under Title VII. Fantini v. Salem State College, 557 F.3d 22 (1st Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). \u201c \u2019The statutory scheme of Title VII itself holding that the definition of employer for title vii purposes does not encompass individu al supervisors even if such individuals are acting as agents of the employerholding that only employers not individuals acting in their individual capacity who do not otherwise meet the definition of employers can be held liable under title viiholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that title vii does not provide for a damages claim against supervisors or fellow employeesholding individual defendants are not an employer within meaning of title vii & \n\nis an essential element of a strongly-endorsed and well-articulated policy to eliminate drunk driving by affording offenders \u201czero tolerance\u201d in the prosecution of their offenses. This Court has a commitment to eliminating intoxicated drivers from our highways and has supported that commitment with a ban on plea bargaining in drunk-driving cases. The aims of this broad policy can be accomplished only through consistent, uniform, and vigorous enforcement of the ban. To carve out from that ban an exception in cases of \u201cpermitting an intoxicated person to drive\u201d undermines the important policy behind the prohibition. The person who allows an intoxicated person to drive may be as, or even more, culpable than the driver. See, e.g., Lee v. Kiku Restaurant, 127 N.J. 170, 603 A.2d 503 (1992) (<HOLDING>); Kelly v. Gwinnell, 96 N.J. 538, 476 A.2d 1219 holding that tavern will be held liable for serving alcohol to visibly intoxicated patron who then foreseeably becomes involved in a motor vehicle accidentholding that the sensible and popular understanding of what a motor vehicle accident entails necessarily involves the motor vehicle being operated as a motor vehicle holding proprietor of a tavern was not liable to officer who sustained injuries caused by a patron while the officer was attempting to make an arrestholding tavern owner not liable for injuries sustained when intoxicated patron assaulted a police officerholding a social host liable for serving a visibly intoxicated guest who foreseeably becomes involved in motor vehicle accident & \n\nJoint neither withheld nor paid payroll taxes or employment taxes for Mr. Weaver, and Mr. Weaver was issued an IRS Form 1099 at the end of each year. Joint, however, maintains that it considered Mr. Weaver to be an independent agent for tax purposes only. In May 2011, Mr. Weaver terminated the Agreement. Joint filed the First Lawsuit two months later. Mr. Weaver moved for summary on Joint\u2019s contract claims. He asserted the Agreement was illegal (and therefore unenforceable under Oklahoma law) because Joint paid him as an independent contractor to induce patient referrals for the furnishing of Medicare\/Medicaid-covered equipment, in violation the Medicare Anti-Kickback Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). See United States v. McClatchey, 217 F.3d 823, 835 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Joint countered that the Agreement was legal holding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victimholding that a threat to harm another person is a crime of violenceholding that a person who offers or pays remuneration to another person violates the act so long as one purpose of the offer or payment is to induce medicare or medicaid patient referralsholding that attorneys claim for professional services against person sui juris or against property of such person must rest upon contract of employment express or implied made with person sought to be charged or with his agentholding that a state was embraced within the meaning of the word person where the word person was defined as meaning and including a partnership association company or corporation as well as a natural person & \n\nstatements made to investment analysts. Defendants confuse the test under which they can be held indirectly liable for misleading opinions or statements by analysts or other third parties with the test under which they can be held directly liable for their own misleading statements to analysts. Defendants \u201ccannot escape liability simply because [they] carried out [their] alleged fraud through the public statements of third parties.\u201d Warshaw v. Xoma Corp., 74 F.3d 955, 959 (9th Cir.1996). See also McGann v. Ernst & Young, 95 F.3d 821 (9th Cir.1996) (finding accountant liable for providing fraudulent audit report to corporation where accounting firm knew report would be incorporated in 10-K and distributed to investors); Elkind v.

Lawyers who are preparing to leave a law firm face a dilemma, caught between the fiduciary obligations they owe the other members of their firm, on one hand, and the duty of being able to adequately represent clients who choose to follow them to their new place of employment, on the other hand. As a practical matter, then, cases have recognized that some preliminary preparations by lawyers who are leaving a firm must be allowed, and that it is appropriate for lawyers in these circumstances to make arrangements, prior to their departure, to obtain new office space, equipment, and other materials necessary for the practice of law. Bray v. Squires, 702 S.W.2d 266 (Tex. Ct. App. 1985); see also Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 393, Comment e (1958) (<HOLDING>).

[\u00b6 11] The general principle mandating that corporations be recognized as separate, taxable entities from their owners creates some tension with the requirement that income be taxed to the party who earns it. Recognizing that tension, in 1982 the United States Tax Court noted that, in the corporate context, simply identifying who earned the income may be inadequate to allow a determination of how the income should be taxed because corporations can act, and thus earn income, only through their agents. Johnson, 78 T.C. at 890-91; see also Haag v. Comm\u2019r, 88 T.C. 604, 611 (1987); cf. State v. Placzek, 380 A.2d 1010, 1015 (Me.1977) (<HOLDING>).

Specifically, Olmos-Esparza argues that the government\u2019s use of a certificate of nonexistence of record (\u201cCNR\u201d) and a warrant of deportation as evidence violated his Confrontation Clause rights under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The introduction of a CNR to prove that a defendant did not seek admission from the Attorney General to re-enter the United States does not constitute testimonial hearsay evidence prohibited by Crawford. Rather, it is properly admitted as a nontestimonial public record. United States v. Cervantes-Flores, 421 F.3d 825, \u2014, \u2014 (9th Cir.2005). Similarly, introduction of a warrant of deportation does not violate the Confrontation Clause. United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, 411 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the district court did not err in holding that letters addressing dispute that was subject of litigation and that were written in anticipation of litigation did not fall under business record exception under rule 8036 of the federal rules of evidence and noting that it is wellestablished that one who prepares a document in anticipation of litigation is not acting in the regular course of businessholding that it is notholding that not all of claims file was prepared in anticipation of litigation and noting that the majority of cases that have dealt with the issue of whether investigative materials prepared by insurance claims adjusters is workproduct prepared in anticipation of litigation have held that since insurance companies have a routine duty to investigate accidents such materials are not prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that driving record is nontestimonial as it is not accusatory and does not describe specific criminal wrongdoing of the defendant it contains no expression of opinion or conclusion requiring the exercise of discretion and it merely represents the objective result of a public records searchholding a warrant of deportation nontestimonial because it was not made in anticipation of litigation and because it is simply a routine objective cataloging of an unambiguous factual matter & \n\ncopy of Morris D. Murphy's driving record as maintained by the Secretary of State, as of this date. Although the last paragraph in the certificate referred to an attached copy of Murphy\u2019s driving record, no other document was attached to the certificate. However, a third exhibit, a copy of the letter entitled \u201cNotice of Suspension and Opportunity for Hearing\u201d was also admitted in evidence over Murphy\u2019s objection. 3 . The notice of suspension in the certification stated: \"[N]otice of suspension was sent by regular mail to Richard E. Tayman, Jr. ... by the Violations Bureau of the District Court, pursuant to 29-A MRSA Section 2608.\u201d State v. Tayman, 2008 ME 177, \u00b6 3, 960 A.2d 1151, 1153 (quotation marks omitted). 4 .

The Court reasoned that \u201cthe co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule [Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) ] is firmly enough rooted in our jurisprudence that, under this Court\u2019s holding in Roberts, a court need not inde1 pendently inquire into the reliability of such statements.\u201d Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775. Brist is therefore correct that the Court has rejected Bour-jaily\u2019s underlying reasoning by now requiring courts to conduct a separate Confrontation Clause analysis for out-of-court \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, even when the statements at issue otherwise satisfy a firmly-rooted hearsay exception. See, e.g., Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2540, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (<HOLDING>); Davis v.

Effecting a significant change in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that in criminal prosecutions, unless a declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him, the Confrontation Clause forbids use against the defendant of the declarant\u2019s out-of-court testimonial statements admitted for their truth. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Government does not dispute that the pleas, allocutions, and post-arrest statement made at a proffer session constitute \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d of the sort barred by Crawford. We assume without deciding that this characterization is correct. Cf. United States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); see also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at holding that in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment based on a plea of guilty or no contest a defendant must bring forward a full statement of facts including a transcription of the plea proceedingsholding that a plea allocution is a testimonial statementholding that the defendant was entitled to have his plea accepted absent a sound reason for rejecting the pleaholding that plea of guilty or nolo contendere is not rendered involuntary because it is a product of plea bargaining an accepted plea bargain must be recorded and court may accept a bargained plea to a lesser offense reasonably related to a charged offenserecognizing that a voluntary and understanding guilty plea entered without the benefit of a plea bargain waives all nonjurisdictional defects that occurred before the entry of the plea & \n\n10 . Plaintiff avers incorrectly that the LOGO provision becomes inoperative upon receipt of full funding under the contract. Rather, because this is a fixed-price contract, the LOGO clause remains operative with regard to work under the original scope of the contract or any subsequently executed bilateral modification. 11 . Defendant argued that the LOGO and FP limitations on liability would preclude plaintiff from recovery even in the event of breach. Defendant's argument is curious. The court will not interpret these clauses to reach an unjust or impractical result. It is axiomatic that either party would be entitled to some recovery in the event of a breach of the contract. See Raymond Constructors of Africa, Ltd. v. United States, 188 Ct.Cl. 147, 166, 411 F.2d 1227, 1237 (1969) (<HOLDING>); Solar Turbines, 26 Cl.Ct. at 1276 (finding holding confrontation clause inapplicable at sentencingholding that bankruptcy court could not enter judgment for 7402564 under 107a for incurred costs when such costs had not been incurredrecognizing that the contractor may recover costs when loss of productivity results from the governments actionsholding limitation clause inapplicable where contractor incurred additional costs as a result of governments failure to performholding that the government could not charge contractor excess cost of relet contract where government caused a delay in contract performance in which contractor was to use his own equipment original contractors costs increased and government refused to allow original contractor to perform at cost but allowed new contractor to use government equipment and paid new contractor a different rate & \n\nconsequences of his own wrongful acts. It grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated. Id. at 158. In other words, while the Constitution does grant a privilege of confronting ones accusers, that privilege is lost if the accuser causes the witness's unavailability at trial. \u00b6 40. Since the Reynolds decision, the Court has continued to acknowledge the concept that a defendant can forfeit through misconduct his or her confrontation rights. See, e.g., Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 451-53 (1912) (<HOLDING>); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106 holding that a hearsay statement can itself be considered in first determining if a conspiracy existed when the statement was madeholding that defendant who introduced hearsay statement waived objection to admission of another part of same statementholding that a defendant waives right to object to a hearsay statement on confrontation grounds when he or she offers the statementholding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding prior statement subject to crossexamination when made does not violate confrontation clause & \n\nthat the admission of Permanian\u2019s statements violated the holding in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). In Bruton, the Supreme Court held that the defendant was deprived of his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment when his codefendant\u2019s post-arrest confession, which incriminated the defendant, was admitted at their joint trial. In reaching its decision, the Court acknowledged that there was no recognized exception to the hearsay rule before it. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 128 n.3, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 480 n.3, 88 S. Ct. at statements admissible because there was sufficient indicia of reliability). Moreover, defendant was able to confront and cross-examine Rinaldi, who testified about the statements. See Ramey, 151 Ill. 2d at 528 (<HOLDING>); Goodman, 81 Ill. 2d at 284 (same). We holding that testimonial hearsay statements of a witness who does not appear at trial are inadmissible under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to crossexamine the witnessholding that the sixth amendment confrontation clause was not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under a georgia statute permitting an exception for statements by coconspirators where there was sufficient indicia of reliability supporting the truth of the statementsholding coconspirator hearsay exception does not violate confrontation clauseholding that the sixth amendment right of confrontation applies to all three phases of the capital trial and that the admission of hearsay statements of codefendants in the penalty phase violated the confrontation clauseholding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were made & \n\nprosecutor began his rebuttal direct examination by asking Sergeant DeGraff whether Turbe had asked him to call the F.B.I., and whether Turbe had called the F.B.I. himself. The prosecutor properly posed these questions in order to disprove Turbe\u2019s statement that he had asked the police to call the F.B.I. for him after he was arrested. See United States v. Chrzanowski, 502 F.2d 573 (3d Cir. 1974) (\u201cThe proper function and purpose of rebuttal testimony is to explain, repel, counteract or disprove the evidence of the adverse party.\u201d). Sergeant DeGraff responded to both questions in the negative. Without any further questioning by the for the prosecutor to question Turbe regarding the prior seizure of weapons from his house. See United States v. Jackson, 339 F.3d 349, 357 (5th Cir. 2003) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Vallie, 284 F.3d 917, 921-22 holding that the prosecutors question to the defendant about a prior unrelated offense was improperholding prosecutors reference in closing argument to defendants prior conviction constituted an introduction of evidence so extremely unfair as to violate fundamental conceptions of justice and thus a deprivation of defendants right to due processholding that the prosecutors indirect reference to a defendants prior conviction was improperholding that prosecutors reference to cooperation agreements with government witnesses was not plain errorholding that the prosecutors reference to the nonexistence of mitigating evidence was not a comment on the defendants failure to testify & \n\nreasons, the Court has held that presumptively involuntary statements taken in violation of Miranda may be used by the prosecution for impeachment purposes on cross-examination. See Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971). These holdings do not extend to cases of actually coerced confessions. Before Fulminante, the distinction between actually and presumptively coerced confessions was relevant with regard to harmless error as well. In deciding, as the Su preme Court did in Fulminante, that the improper introduction at trial of an actually coerced confession is subject to harmless error analysis, the Court overturned a well established line of precedent which held to the contrary. See Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029 (1945) (<HOLDING>); Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376, 84 S.Ct. holding introduction of actually coerced confession constitutes reversible error even where confession was cumulative in natureholding failure of prosecution to disclose evidence that may be favorable to the accused is a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendmentholding that states procedure providing for jury evaluation of voluntariness of a defendants confession violates fourteenth amendment due processholding that introduction of an actually coerced confession deprives the defendant of his fourteenth amendment rights to due process even if ample evidence existed to otherwise support the convictionholding that question of whether a confession was coerced was not to be resolved by considering the truth or falsity of the confession & \n\ndisagree. The Confrontation Clause provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. This Court in Globe v. State, 877 So.2d 663 (Fla.2004), addressed a Confrontation Clause issue and held that the clause was not implicated where Globe and his codefendant, Busby, speaking together to a law enforcement officer, gave a joint taped statement in which they admitted killing a fellow inmate and where the tape was played at trial. The Court reasoned thusly: We have previously recognized that admissions by acquiescence or silence do not implicate the Confrontation Clause. See Nelson v. State, 748 So.2d 237 (Fla.1999); see also United States v. Kehoe, 310 F.3d 579, 590-91 (8th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 2112, holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were madeholding that an absent witnesss statements are admissible under the confrontation clause only where the declarant is unavailable and only where the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamineholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statementsholding that any confrontation right is found in the fourteenth amendments due process clause not the confrontation clause of the sixth amendmentholding that the confrontation clause did not guarantee the defendant the right to crossexamine a speaker whose statements were imputed to the defendant as adoptive admissions of a party opponent & \n\n(\"The court or jury trying the case involving a violation of clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of \u00a7 18.2-266 or \u00a7 18.2-266.1, or 18.2-272 shall determine the innocence or guilt of the defendant from all the evidence concerning his condition at the time of the alleged offense.\u201d); Code \u00a7 18.2-268.10(A) (providing that the \"court shall, regardless of the result of any blood or breath tests, consider other relevant admissible evidence of the condition of the accused\u201d). 6 .

A. Citizenship and Immigration Status As noted above, appellant\u2019s citizenship status is not in dispute. The record reflects, and the State acknowledges, that appellant is not a United States citizen. B. Knowledge of Immigration Consequences Before examining the strength of the evidence of the appellant\u2019s guilt, we must examine the record for any indication that the defendant knew the consequences of his guilty plea. VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 713 (stating that the strength or weakness of the evidence against the appellant makes little difference to the harm analysis if the second factor above is not satisfied). To warrant reversal, the record must support an inference that the defendant did not know the consequences of his plea. Burnett, .-Dallas 2004, pet. ref'd) (<HOLDING>). We do not have a silent record.

Whether, in this particular case, this interest is substantial enough to be regarded as a \u201cprotected interest\u201d under the Due Process Clause \u2014 a question which we need not answer \u2014 the interest does not appear to be as significant as, for example, the loss of income or public-assistance benefits. See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). Accordingly, Perry\u2019s interest does not weigh heavily in the Mathews v.

Another issue implicates the Confrontation Clause. The analyses in Richardson, Gray, and Vasilakos assume the presence of a limiting instruction. See, e.g., Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (<HOLDING>). Here, no limiting instruction was given to holding that where a defendants name is replaced with a neutral pronoun as long as identification of the defendant is clear or inculpatory only by reference to evidence other than the redacted confession and a limiting instruction is given to the jury there is no bruton violationholding that when all references to the defendant in a eodefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the clause was not violated by a redacted confession with a proper limiting instructionholding that when all references to the defendant in a codefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the confession did not violate the confrontation clause because it was redacted to eliminate not only the defendants name but any reference to his or her existence & \n\nnot \u201cserious\u201d enough to require the protection of that a constitutional guaranty of jury trial does not apply to proceedings to punish for contempt of court whether in a court of law, a court of equity, a court having criminal jurisdiction, or other court.\u201d Pass v. State, 181 Tenn. 613, 184 S.W.2d 1, 3 (1944) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ahern v. Ahern, 15 S.W.3d 73, 82 (Tenn.2000). Additionally, unlike criminal prosecutions, general contempt proceedings do not require an indictment and subsequent' prosecution by the State. Tenn. R.Crim. P. 42(b)(2); Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 185-86, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958), overruled in part on other grounds by Bloom, 391 U.S. at 196 n. 1, 198, 88 S.Ct. 1477; State v. Wood, 91 S.W.3d 769, 773 (Tenn.Ct.App.2002) (<HOLDING>). Contempt proceedings are often initiated upon holding that the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches at the time of a formal charge which we construe to be an arrest warrant or at the time of the preliminary hearing in those rare cases where a preliminary hearing is not preceded by an arrest warrant or by indictment or presentment when the charge is initiated by the grand jury quoting state v mitchell 593 sw2d 280 286 tenn 1980recognizing that an indictment may be dismissed in partholding a statement in the motion for new trial entitled certificate of presentment in which appellate counsel stated the motion was handdelivered to the trial court insufficient to establish presentmentrecognizing that criminal contempt is not initiated by an indictment or presentmentholding that certificate of presentment and docket entry noting filing of motion were insufficient evidence of presentment & \n\ncourt has jurisdiction to review an IJ\u2019s decision to deny an alien\u2019s application for voluntary departure.

If new techniques are offered, however, the district court must hold an in limine hearing under the Daubert standard as set out above. The fact that we have taken judicial notice of the reliability of the technique of DNA profiling does not mean that expert testimony concerning DNA profiling is automatically admissible under Daubert. A number of courts have required that the trial court further inquire into whether the expert properly performed the techniques involved in creating the DNA profiles. See People v.

It is important to emphasize that we are taking no position on the question whether, in this context, expert testimony would be required if a party raised the point.

Dr. Margolis testified that Mr. Jones had only about a ten per cent, chance of infection over the course of a year. While the fact that the government would have presented an opposing expert is not by itself a' sufficient reason to exclude Dr. Gubbins\u2019s testimony, it was a factor that the District Court properly considered in its assessment.

The case was docketed here for the January 2014 term and submitted for decision on the briefs. 2 In addition, OCGA \u00a7 16-3-21 (d) (2), which was enacted in 1993, authorizes relevant expert testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s condition of mind at the time of the offense, including relevant facts and circumstances relating to the family violence or child abuse that are the bases of the expert\u2019s opinion, to support a justification defense in a prosecution for murder or manslaughter.

Then in Kumho Tire Co. v.

Interestingly, the liberalization of the standard for admission of expert testimony creates an intriguing juxtaposition with our oft-repeated abuse-of-discretion standard of review. While we adhere to this discretionary standard for review of the district court\u2019s Rule 702 gatekeeping deeision, cases are legion that, correctly, under Daubert, call for the liberal admission of expert testimony. See, e.g., United States v. Finch, 630 F.3d 1057, 1062 (8th Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>); Robinson v. GEI-CO Gen. Ins.

Smith, 615 F.2d 964, 17 V.I. 623 (3d Cir. 1980): If a defendant\u2019s right to due process can be violated by strict rules of evidence that prevent a defendant from presenting clearly exculpatory evidence to the jury, can that same right also be violated by the failure to affirmatively grant immunity to an available defense witness who will not testify under grounds of self-incrimination when the witness is likely to offer clearly exculpatory testimony?

Under these circumstances, we do not believe the jury\u2019s award of replacement cost at a level proposed by the plaintiffs expert was so far outside the range of evidence as to suggest the jury was motivated by passion. See Schmitt, 170 N.W.2d at 660-61 (<HOLDING>). A similar view can be reasonably taken of the holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial courtholding that appellate courts determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction based on a review of all of the evidence admitted at trialholding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objectionholding new trial cannot be based on claim of prejudice arising from jurys reliance on evidence admitted without objectionholding any error in admission of evidence cured when same evidence later admitted without objection & \n\nthat may arise when a court addresses the issues whether an objective or subjective intent is required for murder and whether voluntary intoxication can negate the requisite intent.

See, e.g., Federal Rule of Evidence 615. Although that Rule authorizes a district court to sequester witnesses to prevent them from hearing the testimony of other witnesses, it also provides several exceptions, including an exception for \u201ca person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3).

In addition to prohibiting legal expert testimony which defines the governing law, courts have also prohibited legal expert opinion which applies the law to the facts. Many courts have held that the judge is the sole arbiter of the law and its application to the facts. See, Marx & Co. v.

It is proper for the jury to be charged in the disjunctive even though the indictment (or information) may allege the differing methods of committing the offense in the conjunctive. Kitchens v. State, 823 S.W.2d 256, 258 (Tex.Crim.App.1991). In this connection, alternative theories of committing the same offense are properly submitted to the jury in the disjunctive if the evidence is sufficient to support a finding under any of the theories submitted. Id; see also Rosales v. State, 4 S.W.3d 228, 231 (Tex.Crim.App.1999) (<HOLDING>). This comports with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s holding when a statute defines manner or means of committing an offense indictment need not allege matters beyond the language of the statuteholding although indictment may allege manner and means of committing offense in the conjunctive jury may be charged in the disjunctive and a conviction on any method alleged will be upheld if the evidence supports itholding that when an indictment charges several acts in the conjunctive the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts chargedholdingthat an error in instructing the jury that an offense could be committed by a statutory method not charged in the indictment is cured where the court provides the jury with the indictment and instructs jurors that the burden of proof rests upon the state to prove every material allegation of the indictment and every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt citation omittedholding that for purposes of 18 usc 924c1 the law is well established that where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means & \n\nremains the same,\u201d such as by correcting a \u201cmisnomer\u201d or mistake of form. United States v. Young Bros., Inc., 728 F.2d 682, 693 (5th Cir.1984). Thus, the issue is whether the amendment to the serial number constituted a change in form akin to correcting a typographical error or a change in substance that impermissibly altered the indictment. Although we have never addressed this question directly, precedent from this circuit and others suggests that the particular attributes of a firearm are not actual elements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 150 F.3d 401, 417 (5th Cir.1998) (finding no grounds to reverse conviction when indictment charged a dif ferent gauge of shotgun than that presented during trial); United States v.

The trial court expressly limited the admission of the evidence of the subsequent rape in instructions to the jury both before the tender of the evidence and in its final mandate to the jury immediately prior to their deliberations. As the evidence of the subsequent rape was admitted in part to show intent and modus operandi of defendant, remoteness in time of the second act is less important to its admissibility. Id. As defendant concedes, this Court has upheld the admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) where the crimes] wrongs, or acts occurred after the offenses for which a defendant was on trial. State v. Hutchinson, 139 N.C. App. 132, 136, 532 S.E.2d 569, 572 (2000) (<HOLDING>). Indeed, under the plain language of the rule, holding that evidence of gang involvement was properly admitted to prove motive for participating in the alleged crimesholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept the defendants guilty pleas to two counts of the indictment and stating that even if the trial court erred the error had not prejudiced the defendant because he was found guilty by the jury of the charges to which he intended to plead and the evidence of the other crimes would have been admissible in the trial for the first degree murder chargeholding trial court improperly instructed jury in trial for possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute that evidence of defendants similar acts of possession was admissible to show motive where motive was not element of crime charged and defendant did not contest motiveholding the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendants subsequent conduct in determining whether he possessed the intent and motive for the first degree burglary chargeholding that motive is circumstantial evidence of intent & \n\nRule 29(c)). 9 . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) states, in relevant part; It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 10 .It is not clear whether the government attempted to demonstrate that the pistol and rifle were acquired separately and at different times or places. If they did not make such a showing, the indictment under which Alanis was charged would be duplicitous under our recent holding in United States v. Buchmeier, 255 F.3d 415, 422 (7th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The defense did not challenge the indictment holding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involvedholding that when the indictment charges that a certain minimum quantity of drugs is involved in the offense proof of that quantity is a fourth element of the offenseholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that the quantity of drugs involved in an offense does not support a downward departure because the legislature intended the quantity of drugs to be a determining factor in varying penaltiesholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that count & \n\nassumption is in error. On April 30, 1993, the court dismissed all the charges against Woodland without prejudice. In October of 1993, new charges were filed. During the approximately seven months separating the dismissal and the reinstatement of charges, Woodland was confined in a mental institution. This period of confinement involved no formal charges. Woodland was not held because he was an alleged criminal but because his mental health at the time warranted such confinement. This period should not be used to calculate a speedy trial violation. See Trafny, 799 P.2d at 706 (stating that time spent holding defendant on separate parole violation following formal dismissal of charges cannot be attributable to state); see also Johnson v. United States, 333 F.2d 371, 374 (10th Cir.1964) (<HOLDING>). The State filed new charges against Woodland holding that the constitutional right to a speedy trial includes the right to a reasonably prompt sentencingholding that the dismissal of an indictment before trial and institution of a superseding indictment does not trigger double jeopardyholding that ajppellant can not complain of the denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial because of his confinement in a state mental institution after dismissal of the former indictmentholding that a 19month delay between indictment and trial did not violate the constitutional right to a speedy trialholding that trial courts limited findings were insufficient to allow determination of whether trial court abused its discretion in denying defendants motion to dismiss his indictment on constitutional speedy trial grounds & \n\nof each of the burglaries. See Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2) (permitted uses of other-bad-acts evidence). His presence near eight burglaries over 5 months, where each burglary was characterized by substantially similar circumstances pointing to a common culprit or culprits, is powerful identity evidence. With regard to whether the evidence from the different burglaries was capable of separation by the jury, and whether Appellant was unduly prejudiced by the decision not to sever the cases, the trial court notes that the verdict speaks for itself: Appellant was acquitted of several burglaries and conspiracy counts, indicating that the jury clearly was able to parse the evidence involved in each individual case. See TOO at 11. We agree. See Commonwealth v. Dozzo, 991 A.2d 898, 903 (Pa. Super. 2010) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that each defendants actions in a 1983 case must be considered individuallyholding that the jury found the ajppellant not guilty of all charges in one case and not guilty of three out of four charges in a second case demonstrating the jury considered each case and each charge separately and did not cumulate the evidenceholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants request for severance because the district court nullified any prejudicial error when it repeatedly admonished the jury throughout the trial to consider the evidence only against the defendant to whom it related and at the end of trial gave the jury instructions that admonished the jury to consider separately each offense and evidence in support of each offenseholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept the defendants guilty pleas to two counts of the indictment and stating that even if the trial court erred the error had not prejudiced the defendant because he was found guilty by the jury of the charges to which he intended to plead and the evidence of the other crimes would have been admissible in the trial for the first degree murder chargeholding that an exception to the charges having to do with contributory negligence charges two three and four was insufficient to preserve issue for appeal & \n\nincludes \u201cseveral transactions or occur rences, any of which could constitute one of the acts proscribed by the charged statutes.\u201d United States v. Beros, 883 F.2d 455, 460-61 (3d Cir.1987). The Beros court noted that \u201cjust as the sixth amendment requires jury unanimity in federal criminal cases on each delineated offense that it finds a defendant culpable ... it must also require unanimity regarding the specific act or acts which constitutes that offense. Absent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too little protection in too many instances.\u201d Id. at 461. The Seventh Circuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to Holley. See United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 471 (7th Cir.1998). But see United States v. Margiotta, 646 F.2d 729, 733 (2d Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>).

See Schmitt, 170 N.W.2d at 660-61 (<HOLDING>). A similar view can be reasonably taken of the holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial courtholding that appellate courts determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction based on a review of all of the evidence admitted at trialholding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objectionholding new trial cannot be based on claim of prejudice arising from jurys reliance on evidence admitted without objectionholding any error in admission of evidence cured when same evidence later admitted without objection & \n\n... to trigger the [IAD], and that he did request, as he was required to do, a trial within the time period.\u201d Subsequently, the judge denied the State\u2019s motion for reconsideration. The State appeals, contending that the motion judge erred in dismissing the indictment and that the IAD was not applicable. Under the IAD, a person who is imprisoned in one state, who has, pending in another state which is a party to the agreement, an \u201cuntried indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against\u201d him, must \u201cbe brought to trial within 180 days after he [has] caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer\u2019s jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a fin ) (<HOLDING>). Here, the State never filed a detainer. \u201cA holding that a defendant is not entitled to dismissal of an indictment under the iad as no detainer had been lodged against himholding that indictment sufficiently informed defendant of the charge against him so as to enable him to prepare a defense and thus there is no claim that he was surprised at trialholding that if the time limits of the iad have been violated the charges underlying the detainer must be dismissedholding that the 180day time period in article 111a of the iad does not commence until the prisoners request for final disposition of the charges against him has actually been delivered to the court and prosecuting officer of the jurisdiction that lodged the detainer against himrecognizing that under fex prisoners request for final disposition requires actual delivery to court and prosecuting officer of jurisdiction that lodged detainer against him & \n\nanother. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(1) (1992). 4 . Although \u201cbank robbery\" is not an expressly listed offense, separate from \u201crobbery,\u201d the Guidelines assume that \"robbery\u201d encompasses \"bank robbery.\" Under section 2B3.1 of the Guidelines, which assigns offense levels to various forms of \u201crobbery,\" a sentencing court is instructed to increase the offense level by a certain number of points \u201c[i]f the property of a financial institution ... was taken____\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(1) (1992). 5 . These purposes include, inter alia, (1) \"to provide just punishment;\u201d (2) to deter criminal conduct; and (3) \"to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant____\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). 6 . Our observation in this regard might be read as implicitly questioning our decision in Baskin, 886 F.2d at 389 (<HOLDING>). We do not address the validity of Baskin in holding that robbery is a crime of violence for purposes of habitualoffender sentencingholding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16holding that a sentencing judge retains discretion to examine the underlying facts of a case in deciding whether an offense is a crime of violence under section 4b12holding that sexual abuse of a minor is a violent crime within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines and noting that definitions of crime of violence in 18 usc 16 and ussg 4b12 differ slightly finding reyescastro to be persuasive in its 4b12 analysisholding that once the statute is found to be divisible the court must look to the charging papers and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual crime of which defendant was convicted was a crime of violence but emphasizing that the court is not to examine the particular facts underlying the conviction & \n\ndifferent place in the superseding indictment than it does in the statute makes no difference here. First, the \u201cattempt\u201d language appears after \u201cknowingly\u201d and before the other elements of the crime. \u201cAttempt\u201d can fairly be read to modify all of the elements that follow the word, not just the \u201cmeans or facility of interstate commerce\u201d element. Second, even if the \u201cattempt\u201d language in the superseding indictment is somewhat imprecise, this does not render the superseding indictment insufficient. \u201c[D]ue process does not require a recitation of the statute; it requires only that the [indictment] as a whole set forth the critical details of the offense charged.\u201d United States v. Lentsch, 369 F.3d 948, 953 (6th Cir.2004); see also United States v. Martinez, 981 F.2d 867, 872 (6th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Third, given the circumstances in which this holding that the government need not prove that the defendant actually knew the exact nature of the substance to establish mens rea knowledge of drugs illegality is sufficientholding that a mens rea of unlawfully in the indictment was sufficient because the indictment referenced the applicable statute which required a reckless mens reaholding convictions under fla stat 893131 qualify as serious drug offenses pursuant to the acca despite the florida statutes lack of a mens rea elementholding that an indictment gave sufficient notice when the indictment charged the elements of the offenseholding that an indictment that omitted the mens rea element was sufficient because it cited the applicable statutes which informed the defendant of the elements of the charged offenses & \n\nof the sudden emergency instruction, was appropriate considering the trial court\u2019s finding that the situation lacked spontaneity. Id. In the case before us, a jury could find that a vehicle suddenly spinning out of control immediately ahead of defendant-driver created a spontaneous reaction not necessarily present when vehicles are stopped in the road ahead of a driver who is able to see the stopped vehicles before the collision. Based upon our de novo review, we conclude that the rear-end collision instruction amounted to harmless error and that the sudden emergency jury instruction was correctly given. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred in granting the motion for new trial. See Lieberman v. Bliss-Doris Realty Associates, L.P., 819 A.2d 666, 673 (R.I.2003) (<HOLDING>). Conclusion We vacate the order of the holding that trial judge should have granted new trial rather than judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the judge could not know in what order the jury reached its inconsistent verdictsholding that a motion to intervene filed after final judgment should have been grantedholding that the presentation of a new theory does not constitute the presentation of a new issue on which a jury trial should be granted as of right under rule 38bholding that where jury has been properly instructed counsel is not ineffective for failing to object to an instructionholding new trial should not have been granted because jury was properly instructed & \n\ndefendants also say that the prosecution presented false evidence to the grand jury in order to secure an indictment. We have reviewed the evidence and conclude that there is no evidence to indicate that the government\u2019s testimony and evidence before the grand jury was false. The majority of the arguments presented by the defendants go to the weight and interpretations of the evidence, instead of demonstrating actual false statements made by the government. In addition, many of the arguably false statements appear to be about information that is not material to the case. The Ninth Circuit appears to focus on the materiality of statements when analyzing whether there has been government misconduct that warrants sanctions. See United States v. Kennedy, 564 F.2d 1329, 1338 (9th Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>) Post-Indictment The second argument focus on holding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding that tribal courts are not subject to the fifth amendments requirement of indictment by grand juryholding that the trial court erred in denying the defendants motion in arrest of judgment when the indictment lacked a material element and it was not apparent that the grand jury based the indictment on facts that satisfy this element of the crime and that the only permissible cure was to send the matter back to the grand juryrecognizing that a constructive amendment to an indictment occurs when either the government the court or both broadens the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand juryholding that in the situation of a possible dismissal of an indictment because of possible grand jury tampering only where knowing perjury relating to a material matter has been presented to the grand jury should the trial judge dismiss an otherwise valid indictment & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v.

Recent cases analyzing the effect of this change have concluded that under the current ABA standards, the decision whether to request lesser offense instructions is for defense counsel. See Cannon v. Mullin, 383 F.3d 1152, 1167 (10th Cir.2004) (based on change in third edition, \"(whether to argue a lesser-included offense is a matter to be decided by counsel after consultation with the defendant\"); Simeon, 90 P.3d at 184 (relying in part on the change in the ABA standards to hold that the decision to request lesser offense instructions rests with counsel); Mathre v. State, 619 N.W.2d 627, 629-31 (N.D.2000) (<HOLDING>). Additionally, we note that several holding that counsel was not ineffective in failing to request a charge on the lesserincluded offense when the evidence showed either the commission of the completed offense as charged or the commission of no offense such that the defendant was not entitled to a charge on the lesser offenseholding that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to consult with defendant about seeking lesser offense instructions because under current aba standards the decision is not one that must be made by defendantholding that counsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think that a rational defendant would want to appealholding that counsel may not be deemed ineffective under strickland for failing to object to jury instructions where this court previously upheld validity of those instructionsholding that where trial counsel was not ineffective appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel & \n\nyears to life for a first conviction and a penalty of 20 years to life for a second or subsequent conviction\u201d; subsection (b) sets forth what \u201ccould properly [be] characterized as an \u2018aggravated\u2019 continuing criminal enterprise,\u201d carrying a mandatory life term, and requiring additional \u201celements\u201d to be proven. Montalvo argues that his \u201cillegal mandatory life sentence must be corrected to a term authorized by the facts reflected in the basic verdict for a continuing criminal enterprise.\u201d It appears that Montalvo argues that he was convicted of a \u201cbasic\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(a), but sentenced for an \u201caggravated\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(b). So construed, this argument is cognizable under Rule 35(a). Fowler, 794 F.2d at 1449 (<HOLDING>). However, Montalvo\u2019s challenge fails on the holding that rule 35a can be used to challenge sentences that are not authorized by the judgment of convictionholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding that affidavits that are conclusory and based on hearsay can not be used to oppose motion for summary judgmentrecognizing that the phrases can be used interchangeablyholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him & \n\n1223, 1228 (7th Cir.1994) (same); United States v.

Therefore, the court holds that the second indictment in this case can properly be referred to as a \u201csuperseding\u201d indictment. The superseding-versus-new-indictment issue might have been an interesting and relevant debate if the Speedy Trial Act or the statute of limitations were the focus of defendants\u2019 appeals from the Detention Order, because those are the only situations in which it matters whether an indictment is a superseding indictme (D.C.1979) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

(Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter.

In its order, the trial court found \u201cthat plaintiff [Chandler] would not be able to assert fraud based upon a fraudulent inducement to enter into a contract to pay a portion of revenue monies since the former has been determined to be a void contract as against public policy.\u201d In light of our holdings in parts I, II, and III, we conclude that the reasoning given by the trial court in support of the summary judgment on the fraud claim was incorrect. The question then becomes whether the summary judgment can be sustained on any other grounds. See Lowe v. East End Memorial Hosp. & Health Centers, 477 So.2d 339 (Ala.1985) (<HOLDING>).

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v.

These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit. This case is, thus, distinguishable from those in which courts declined to dismiss claims recognized under New Jersey local law, even though out-of-state plaintiffs might have been unable to pursue such causes of action under their own state\u2019s local law. In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree.

In addressing this issue, the District Court looked to a 1998 district court opinion that predicted that the New Jersey Supreme Court would not allow an affirmative cause of action for intentional spoliation, Larison v. City of Trenton, 180 F.R.D. 261, 266 (D.N.J.1998). The New Jersey Supreme Court has since authorized tort recovery for intentional spoliation. See Rosenblit, 766 A.2d at 758. Moreover, when it did so, the New Jersey Supreme Court did not adopt the strict causation and damages theories propounded by Larison. Compare Larison, 180 F.R.D. at 266 (predicting that a prima facie case could not be established unless and until the plaintiff shows that he failed to prove his original case because of the missing evidence), with Tartaglia, 961 A.2d at 1190 (<HOLDING>).

Though the time period of retroactivity is particularly long here, such a concern is in part offset by the failure of the Plaintiffs to articulate a vested right with which the New Law interferes, as well as by the specific context of trade duties. In examining the nature and circumstances of the New Law, the court notes that customs duties are to an extent unique from other government assessments in that there is no right to import, and where unfair trade remedies apply, those with goods that may be imported rarely can predict with accuracy what the duty will be. See Norwegian Nitrogen Prods. Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 318, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933) (<HOLDING>).

When the language of the insurance .policy is unambiguous, it is the court\u2019s duty to give the words used their plain meaning. Clemons, 879 S.W.2d at 391. Here, the policy unambiguously required the insured, Perrotta, to submit to an EUO and sign and swear to it. Perrotta relies on Century Ins. Co. v.

We hold further that where this duty is breached, an employee can recover such damages as result from the difference in coverage.\u201d Id. at 535-536.

Jotun\u2019s Ability To Recover Attorney\u2019s Fees Incurred in the Instant Lawsuit With respect to Jotun\u2019s claims that it be reimbursed for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in this action, Liberty argues that Jotun cannot recover these fees pursuant to Louisiana law. Jotun claims that Louisiana Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22:658 and 22:1220 provide an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a result of its having to enforce Liberty\u2019s duty to defend. \u201c g, PA., 691 So.2d 715, 727 (La.Ct.App.1997) (<HOLDING>).

The control of prosecutorial comments to the jury is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed absent a clear showing of abuse. Absent a contemporaneous objection, Jones\u2019 attorney was required to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted fundamental error. See Crump v.

Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\n843; Roberts v. State, (1981) Ind.App., 419 N.E.2d 803. In this case, the prosecutor's argument was improper in several ways. Further, we are persuaded that this misconduct placed Johnson in a position of grave peril, so that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. The prosecutor stated that a defense attorney's job is to \"get his client off\" by bringing out \"insignificant facts\" and \"legal technicalities.\" Our courts, finding no grave peril, have held that such remarks do not always mandate a mistrial. Hubbard v. State, (1974) 262 Ind. 176, 313 N.E.2d 346; Drossos v. State, (1982) Ind.App., 442 N.E.2d 1. Nevertheless, such comments are irrelevant to the issues to be decided by the jury and should not be allowed. See Craig v. State, (1977) 267 Ind. 359, 370 N.E.2d 880 (<HOLDING>). Further, the prosecutor asked the jury to holding that improper statement was rendered harmless because the district court sustained the defendants objection and admonished the jury to disregard the statementholding prosecutors statement that he had duty to all society including accused while a correct statement of the law was unfair and highly improperholding prosecutors statement that defendant and defense counsel were lying when they pleaded not guilty was improperholding that the district courts improper admission of an unauthenticated registration statement was harmless because the proponent of the registration statement later properly authenticated the statement in a motion to reconsiderholding appellate argument that statement violated rule 404b was improper because it was the defendant who elicited the statement at trial & \n\nand acceptance of responsibility as mitigating factors. See Sensback, 720 N.E.2d at 1164-1165. 2. Lack of Criminal History Page argues that the trial court gave no weight to his lack of criminal history. We disagree. The trial court recognized Page\u2019s lack of criminal history as a miti-gator but discounted the value of this miti-gator. Specifically, the trial court stated, \u201cThe court finds as mitigating circumstances that he has some criminal history, arguably it\u2019s not significant, but a weapons charge and another pending crime of violence along with these three crimes of violence, I don\u2019t think the mitigators are worth much.\u201d Transcript at 34. Page asks us to review the weight given to this mitigating factor for abuse of discretion, which we cannot do. See Anglemyer, 868 N.E.2d at 491 (<HOLDING>). B. Aggravators Page appears to argue that the holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave aggravating factors considerable weightholding that the relative weight or value assignable to aggravating and mitigating factors properly found is not subject to review for abuse of discretionholding that a trial courts weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors will not be disturbed absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretionholding that trial court retains wide discretion to apply or reject mitigating and aggravating factors as well as to interpret meaning of individual factors and its determination must be upheld absent abuse of discretionholding imposition of the death penalty proportionate where the trial court found two aggravating circumstances ccp and contemporaneous murder two statutory mitigating factors and a number of nonstatutory mitigating factors & \n\nif the jury posed a question about insurance during deliberations. Evidence of insurance is generally not admissible at trial unless it is offered for a purpose permitted by Federal Rule of Evidence 411. See also Piontkowski v. Scott, 65 Ohio App.3d 4, 582 N.E.2d 1002, 1003-04 (1989). Gratzianna\u2019s brief reference to \u201cCincinnati Insurance\u201d was inadvertent and unresponsive to the question Chapman\u2019s counsel asked. \u25a0 Counsel hurriedly diverted the jury\u2019s attention from the comment and, unlike the cases on which defendants rely, defense counsel did not ask the court contemporaneously to strike the witness\u2019s remark and instruct the jury to disregard it, nor did counsel ask for an immediate curative instruction. Cf. e.g., Kaltrider v. YMCA of Cleveland, Ohio, 457 F.2d 768, 770 (6th Cir.1972) (<HOLDING>); Davis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 967 F.2d holding the lack of a contemporaneous objection could not be salvaged by a motion for a mistrialholding no prejudice occurred where party made contemporaneous objection to brief remark about insurance during closing argument and court gave cautionary instructionholding a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate reviewholding that when no objection was made to jury instruction evidence to support finding based on instruction should be assessed in light of the instruction givenholding mistrial unwarranted where contemporaneous objection was made to single mention of insurance and court gave cautionary instruction & \n\npreserved her objections with regard to termination of the Lease. Tenant argues on appeal that it was error for the metropolitan court to terminate the Lease without finding a material violation of the Lease. Tenant further argues that it was error for the metropolitan court to consider Tenant\u2019s non-payment of June rent as part of the basis for terminating the Lease. Tenant appealed both of these issues to the district court, and the district court held that neither issue was preserved for review. As such, Tenant asks this Court to review her claim for fundamental error. Landlord responds that the doctrine of fundamental error is inapplicable to Tenant\u2019s appeal and argues that this Court should not consider the merits of Tenant\u2019s unpreserved appellate argumen 232, 236-37 (1905) (<HOLDING>), aff\u2019d, 204 U.S. 647 (1907).

Id. at 20; July 17, 1998, Motion at 2; June 17, 1998, Motion at 1. Because, for the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the petition is without merit, the Court will deny as moot the Secretary's motion to strike that petition. \u201cThe remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in extraordinary situations.\u201d Kerr v. United States District Court, 426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976). Before a court may issue a writ, a petitioner must demonstrate (1) a clear and indisputable right to the writ and (2) a lack of adequate alternative means to obtain the relief sought. See In Matter of Fee Agreement of Cox, 10 Vet.App. 361, 370 (1997) (<HOLDING>), vacated in part on other grounds sub nom. Cox holding that district court had jurisdiction to consider claims under the all writs actrecognizing the all writs act gives federal courts authority to issue writs of coram nobis to correct fundamental errors in criminal proceedings where the person is no longer in custodyholding that removal to federal court was proper for claims asserted under all writs actholding that this court has power under 28 usc 1651 to issue all writs necessary and appropriate in aid of its jurisdiction and agreeable to the usages and principles of lawholding that this court has authority in appropriate circumstances to issue writs under all writs act 28 usc 1651a & \n\nversa. Id. This court reviews a district court\u2019s determination of inequitable conduct under a two-tiered standard: we review the underlying factual determinations of materiality and intent for clear error, and we review the ultimate decision as to inequitable conduct for an abuse of discretion. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1365. If the district court\u2019s inequitable conduct determination rests on a clearly erroneous finding of materiality or intent, it constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed. Id. We agree with Honda that the undisclosed 96RL information was material to the Three-Status patent because the jury found, and the court upheld, the asserted claims as anticipated by the 96RL system, and ACI has not appealed that decision to us. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291-92 (<HOLDING>). The materiality of the undisclosed holding that in reviewing a defendants motion for judgment of acquittal based on insanity which the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence the court must determine whether no reasonable jury could have failed to find that the defendants criminal insanity at the time of the offense was established by clear and convincing evidenceholding that if a claim is properly invalidated in district court based on the deliberately withheld reference then that reference is necessarily material because a finding of invalidity in a district court requires clear and convincing evidence a higher evidentiary burden than that used in prosecution at the ptoholding that a finding of fraud may be reversed only for clear error but that the finding must be judged in view of the clear and convincing burden of proofholding that fraud on the court must be supported by clear unequivocal and convincing evidenceholding that appellate court may infer that district court considered sentencing guidelines policy statements despite district courts failure to make explicit reference to them & \n\nthe judgment and sentence \u2018set[s] forth the statutory maximum and clearly indicated] that the term of community [custody] does not extend the total sentence beyond that maximum.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 566 (emphasis added) (alterations in original) (quoting State v. Hibdon, 140 Wn. App. 534, 538, 166 P.3d 826 (2007)). While the court did not address Zavala-Reynoso, it did rely in part on Sloan to conclude that a remand to the trial court for clarification was the proper remedy. Torngren, 147 Wn. App. at 566. Although the Torngren court found that an amended sentence was the appropriate remedy in that case, Division Three has also indicated that either an amended sentence or a vacation and remand for resentencing are equally appropriate remedies in these circumstances. Hibdon, 140 Wn. App. at 538 (<HOLDING>).

Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa.

We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\n(Ala.1991).

The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N.

Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\nUnited States or of the state ... may commence a proceeding to secure relief by filing a petition in the district court in the county in which the conviction was had to vacate and set aside the judgment....

Labeling the offense a felony or misdemeanor holding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding pursuant to courts inherent supervisory power over courts that counsel with concurrent prosecutorial obligations may not be appointed to defend indigent personsholding in situation of appointed counsel that if nonfrivolous issues may exist new counsel must be appointedrecognizing the supervisory power of appellate courtsholding based on our supervisory power over the administration of justice that indigent defendants including those charged with misdemeanors were entitled to appointed counsel at trial if they faced incarceration for their crimes & \n\nof sentencing would, in effect, permit the Rule to read: \u201ca determination that no such finding was necessary because the matter controverted was not taken into account in sentencing.\u201d We reject such a reading of the Rule. II We next address what the Rule requires when a district court complies with the substantive requirements of the Rule, but fails to append to the presentence report the appropriate findings or determinations resolving the controverted matters. We hold that such a technical violation of the Rule is a ministerial error which does not require resentencing. The technical error must, however, be corrected by ordering the district court to append to the pre-sentence report the required findings or determinations. United States v. Knockum, 881 F.2d 730, 732 (9th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>); U.S. v.

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

DISCUSSION \u00b644 We must recognize what the statute at issue does. RCW 9.41.040(2)(a)(iv) categorically prevents any person from possessing firearms while pending trial for a series of statutorily enumerated serious crimes. The judge must find only probable cause that the accused committed the crime\u2014 there is no opportunity for an individualized hearing of dangerousness (indeed, the facts of this case demonstrate that judicial discretion will be overruled by the statute). The accused is deprived of the fundamental right to possess firearms and faces additional criminal prosecution upon exercising that right. See State v. Sieyes, 168 Wn.2d 276, 287, 225 P.3d 995 (2010) (<HOLDING>). \u00b645 Though the right to bear arms is not recognizing that the right to bear arms is fundamentalholding right to be fundamentalholding that us supreme court cases do not define the fundamental right to bear arms to include activity barred by the auuw statuteholding that the right to drive is not a fundamental rightrecognizing that a criminal defendants right to a fair trial is fundamental & \n\nonly relies on a self-serving affidavit. Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (stating that \u201csummary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition\u201d). The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nmarijuana patch, (2) the defendant t Ryan, who has substantial expertise and training in investigations relating to marijuana cultivation, that marijuana and other indicia of marijuana cultivation would be located at defendant\u2019s residence.

In short,- contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the totality of these facts do provide a reasonable, common-sense basis for believing that marijuana and related contraband would be found in his residence. The decision of the district court denying defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is AFFIRMED. * This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines o 896 (10th Cir.1992) holding court will generally not consider arguments presented for the first time on appealholding that court will not consider issue raised for first time on appealholding that generally appellate courts will not review an issue raised for the first time on appealholding that subject to limited exceptions this court will not consider issues not presented to the district court but raised for the first time on appealholding that courts of appeals will generally not consider arguments raised on appeal for first time in reply brief & \n\n"}

Jotun claims that Louisiana Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22:658 and 22:1220 provide an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a result of its having to enforce Liberty\u2019s duty to defend. \u201c g, PA., 691 So.2d 715, 727 (La.Ct.App.1997) (<HOLDING>).

After extensive briefing and oral argument on the question of whether the VPL applies to hazards other than fire, the Court has concluded that it need not answer this question to resolve the dispute.

Regarding the difference between the grounds for rescission based on misrepresentations that are material as a matter of law, and misrepresentations that lead an insurer to issue a policy that it otherwise would not have issued if it had known the true facts, we have explained: 'While several of the decisions finding that a misrepresentation was material as a matter of law also address the issue of whether the insurer would have actually issued the policy under the same terms and same premium had it known the true facts, the consideration of that issue [is] not required in making a determination that a misrepresentation was material to the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer. . \u00a1 Id. at 1128; see also Salgado, 22 So.3d at 604 (<HOLDING>).

Thus, although the court credited Gasser\u2019s testimony at least to the extent that this meeting took place, it failed to draw reasonable inferences in favor of Gasser about what took place during this encounter. Given Gasser\u2019s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome. See, e.g., Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia s.p.a., 944 F.2d 870, 878-79, 20 USPQ2d 1045, 1052 (Fed.Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>).

We hold further that where this duty is breached, an employee can recover such damages as result from the difference in coverage.\u201d Id. at 535-536.

Are we collaterally estopped from asserting a synergy argument against the tobacco companies because a jury has formerly held that the plaintiffs injury was not caused by asbestos?

He complains that the State Supreme Court failed to give a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of his Massiah claims. The court concludes that this claim alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas relief, because petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware State Courts\u2019 analysis in a state collateral proceeding.

See Mesa, 489 U.S. at 133-34, 109 S.Ct. 959. We address each of these requirements in turn. 1. Whether Thornburg \u201cact[s] under\u201d an officer of the United States such that removal under the federal officer removal statute is available to him Bell argues that this Court should remand her claim to state court because, based on this Court\u2019s decision in Cromelin, Thornburg cannot take advantage of the federal officer removal statute and remove the case under \u00a7 1442(a)(1). See Cromelin, 177 F.2d at 277 (<HOLDING>).

In a related argument, appellant complains that the magistrate judge improperly permitted several witnesses to testify as rebuttal witnesses. Since the primary object of this proceeding is to determine the best interests of the child, we reject such a crabbed application of the rules of evidence.

To remedy this anatomical deficiency clothing contains pockets. In addition, many individuals carry purses or shoulder bags to hold objects they wish to have with them. Containers such as these, while appended to the body, are so closely associated with the person that they are identified with and included within the concept of one\u2019s person. To hold differently would be to narrow the scope of a search of one\u2019s person to a point at which it would have little meaning. Id. Several other jurisdictions have similarly concluded that the search of a person includes containers held by the person. See United, States v.

In Lalor, we concluded that a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence was not supported by probable cause. See 996 F.2d at 1583. In so doing, however, we distinguished Lalor\u2019s case from prior ones, including Suarez and Williams, wherein the nexus between criminal activity and the targeted premises was based on evidence of the suspect\u2019s drug traf ficking activities combined with the reasonable inference that drug-related evidence would be found in the suspect\u2019s home.

The affidavit also indicated that Rowland had been observed on several occasions collecting his mail from the post office box and then walking back to work. Because the controlled delivery was made to Rowland\u2019s private post office box and not to his residence, however, establishing probable cause that the delivery would take place does not mean there was probable cause that the video tapes would be at Rowland\u2019s residence when the search took place. Therefore, this court must determine whether the affidavit supporting the anticipatory warrant contained evidence establishing a nexus between the contraband and Rowland\u2019s residence. See Hendricks, 743 F.2d at 654-55 (<HOLDING>).

The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence.

The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\ndisabled to the extent he would not be able to function in prison or in the population upon release without control of his delusional disorder.\u201d Citing United States v.

The Harper opinion does not make these criteria the only basis for involuntary medication. See id. at 227, 110 S.Ct. 1028 (<HOLDING>).

We have not adopted the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception for purposes of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or statutory violations, focusing instead on whether the violations are substantial and prejudicial. See Commonwealth v.

Indiana courts have stated also that \"[a] defendant may be liable for false arrest when he or she arrests the plaintiff[s] in the absence of probable cause to do so.\u201d Id. The circumstances of this procedural due process claim do not involve false arrest or false imprisonment under Indiana tort law. Therefore, these exceptions to the law enforcement immunity provision do not apply. 7 . See, e.g., East Chicago Police Dep\u2019t v. Bynum, 826 N.E.2d 22, 26 (Ind.Ct.App.2005) (<HOLDING>); City of Hammond v.

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

Wells, 98 F.3d 808 (4th Cir.1996), one of several agents executing a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment found a loaded firearm in plain view.

First, Primus and Button are concerned only with the solicitation and financing of good faith claims. Here, the Plaza defendants are alleged to have solicited numerous baseless suits by the landowners. Second, the First Amendment does not shield such improper practices in the solicitation and representation of clients as occurred here.

Second, even if the trial court had the authority to declare the Association\u2019s lien superior to the mortgage lien as a sanction, the fact remains that the issue of lien priority was never actually litigated. See Goodman v. Aldrich & Ramsey Enters., Inc., 804 So.2d 544, 547 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002) (providing that for collateral estoppel to apply, the issue \u201cmust have been actually litigated\u201d). Nor would it change the fact that PNC Bank, as the holder of the mortgage who obtained title to the subject property via foreclosure sale, qualified as a first mortgagee regardless of the fact that the Association\u2019s assessment lien survived the foreclosure action. See Beltway Capital, LLC v. Greens GOA Inc., 153 So.3d 330, 333 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014) (<HOLDING>).

He asserts that the Association should have been on notice as a result of his relationship with his client, his communications with the Association on behalf of that client, and the Association\u2019s receipt of a copy of a letter Libner sent to his client indicating that he had a right to recover his fees.

Countrywide seeks summary judgment as to plaintiff William Croye\u2019s claims in Count IV. Inasmuch as Mr. Croye did not execute the loans at issue, Countrywide contends that he does not meet the definition of a \u201cconsumer\u201d under \u00a7 46A-2-122(a) of the WVCCPA wherein the term is defined as \u201cany natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt,\u201d and, thus, has no standing to bring a claim of illegal debt collection under \u00a7 46A-2-128. While it is unlikely that Mr. Croye was ever legally obligated to pay the mortgage loans, plaintiffs have established a question of fact as to whether Mr. Croye was allegedly obligated to pay. See Arnold, v. Palmer, 224 W.Va. 495, 686 S.E.2d 725 (2009) (<HOLDING>). Mr. Croye claims that Countrywide telephoned holding that fraudulent collection on promissory note was reasonably related to breach of contract claimholding that a promissory note is not enforceable against a party who signed the deed of trust but did not sign the promissory note inasmuch as promissory notes and deeds of trust are separate legal documents with unique purposesholding that when note and deed of trust were null and void and of no legal effect because of forgery assignee of note and deed of trust nevertheless had equitable lien upon property for value of construction work for which note and deed of trust were givenholding that mers is capable of being a valid beneficiary of a deed of trust and that while entitlement to enforce both the deed of trust and the promissory note is required to foreclose nothing requires those documents to be unified from the point of inception of the loanholding that when the basis of the earlier suit was that the plaintiff had had defaulted on a promissory note and the claim in the instant action is whether that promissory note was valid the transaction test is met & \n\nwas evidence of contrary intent.

A mere renewal did not affect the lien. However, a renewal could amount to a novation. If, for sufficient consideration, the parties executed a renewal intending a satisfaction of the old debt or lien, it had that effect and the rights of the parties were governed by the new contract. Id. (citing Helmke v. Uecker, 161 S.W. 17 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014Austin 1913, no writ).

The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N. LaSalle, 190 B.R. at 585 (noting \u201cthe lack of any clear standard for determining the fairness of a discrimination in the treatment of classes under a chapter 11 plan\u201d and that \u201cthe limits of fairness in this context have not been established\u201d). Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\nthe court should not have imposed an offense level of 34. He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

An aggrieved party, including a criminal defendant, remains free to seek enforcement of the terms of a release in civil court. Our criminal courts are permitted to take note of these agreements in deciding whether to order restitution and in what amount, but these agreements in no way preclude a criminal court from ordering restitution when appropriate under statute. Id. In essence, the Haltom court upheld a restitution order in the amount of the victim\u2019s medical expenses and lost earnings even though the victim had also received $100,000 \u2014 the limit of Haltom\u2019s policy\u2014 from Haltom\u2019s insurer. See also Crawford v. State, 770 N.E.2d 775, 781 (Ind.2002) (<HOLDING>). We are mindful, however, that elementary holding that restitution is a criminal penalty that negates the imposition of prejudgment interestholding civil restitution judgment that was originally imposed as part of a criminal sentence nondisehargeableholding that imposition of punishment is a judicial functionrecognizing criminal forfeiture as an aspect of punishmentholding that civil settlements have no bearing on decisions of criminal punishment and imposition of a restitution order is a form of punishment and part of a criminal sentence & \n\nopposed was in fact a violation of [the DCHRA]\u201d). Rather, Plaintiff must merely allege, as she does here, that she complained about the sexually degrading nature of the uniforms, i.e. a protected activity, and was terminated in retaliation. See Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. And, in order to complain that the uniforms were sexually degrading, she need not demonstrate that they were unsafe, of poor quality, and inconsistent with generally accepted hotel industry standards. As a result, CBA Article 8.1 would have no impact on Plaintiffs retaliation claim, and is thus irrelevant to the Court\u2019s preemption analysis. Moreover, it is clear that Plaintiffs right against retaliation is not created by the CBA, but is a state-created right under the DCHRA. See e.g., Lingle, 486 U.S. at 412, 108 S.Ct. 1877 (<HOLDING>). Plaintiff alleges that she engaged in a recognizing the statelaw privilege because there was no federal claim to which the records sought would be relevantholding that the statelaw protecting employees from retaliatory discharge was independent from the cba because the statelaw claim could be resolved without interpreting the agreement itselfholding that a wrongful discharge claim based on violation of a state public policy is not preempted because it is a nonnegotiable independent statelaw rightholding that if the state law claim can be resolved without interpreting the agreement the claim is independent for 301 preemption purposesholding that plaintiffs retaliatory discharge claim under michigan law was not preempted because the statelaw tort of retaliatory discharge creates rights independent of those established by the collective bargaining agreement further holding that discrimination claim was not preempted even though the employer was likely to rely on provisions of the cba in its defense & \n\nfactor seven, the relative bargaining power of the parties, weighs against a finding that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily made the waiver. An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin.

His counsel stated that the expedited removal order was invalid and improper inasmuch as Shunaula had possessed a valid visa at the time of his 1997 entry. The IJ concluded that he was not in a position to entertain a collateral attack on the 1997 expedited removal order. The IJ ruled that Shunaula was (1) inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), which renders inadmissible any alien who enters the United States illegally after having been ordered removed pursuant to, inter alia, an order of expedited removal; and therefore (2) ineligible for adjustment of status. See IJ Decision at 5-6, Admin. R. 65-66 (citing Delgado v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 65 (2d Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>)). On appeal to the BIA, Shunaula pressed the holding that a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the apa to review the denial of an aliens application for adjustment of status where the alien is in removal proceedingsholding that aliens inadmissible under 1182a 9c i i are ineligible for adjustment of status under 1255fholding that refugees who have already acquired lpr status are ineligible for a 209c waiver in light of the language in that adjustment of status can be granted to an alien who has not acquired permanent resident statusholding ineligible for adjustment of status alien who was inadmissible due to reentry after prior removalrecognizing that an alien is ineligible for relief under 212c if he was not actually admissible at the time he received an adjustment of status & \n\nwho \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. Like an award made pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent power, an award under \u00a7 1927 is proper when the attorney\u2019s actions are so plainly without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose. See, e.g., Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d 1265, 1273 (2d Cir.1986) (police photographs of client taken an hour after incident in which police officers allegedly employed excessive force in taking client into custody did not constitute such clear evidence of absence of excessive force to render client\u2019s attorney liable for his adversary\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a result of bad faith); Acevedo v.

Barragan-Sanehez v. Rosenberg, 471 F.2d 758, 760 (9th Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>).

This case arises from DHS\u2019s January 17, 2012 reinstatement of the 1999 removal order against Saldana. We treat this appeal as a petition for review of that order of reinstatement. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) (providing that a petition for review with the court of appeal is the \u201csole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal\u201d).

It is a rule of primary jurisdiction, allocating to an administrative agency the first crack at certain matters.\u201d). Accordingly, Garmon preemption provides no basis for removal jurisdiction in federal court. A case falling within the scope of the doctrine must be adjudicated before the NLRB. The lower courts are uniform in finding that Garmon preemption under the NLRA does not completely preempt state laws so as to provide removal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Ethridge v.

While the court acknowledged that \u201cthe Washington statute . . . speak[s] in mandatory language,\u201d id. at 777, it held that the \u201cstatutory requirement that two experts be appointed to examine a defendant is not a constitutional right but is statutory and may be waived by counsel.\u201d Id. at 779; see also State v. Brooks, 16 Wn. App. 535, 538, 557 P.2d 362 (1976) (<HOLDING>). \u00b619 Despite the propriety of waivers in holding that the defenses presentation of two psychiatrists testimony constituted an election of the procedure and a waiver of the specific statutory proceduresrecognizing that where the juvenile code sets forth specific procedures governing termination actions those procedures apply to the exclusion of the rules of civil procedureholding that the presentation of a new theory does not constitute the presentation of a new issue on which a jury trial should be granted as of right under rule 38bholding that brady does not place any burden upon the government to conduct a defendants investigation or assist in the presentation of the defenses caseholding that the issue of waiver requires an analysis of the specific facts in each case & \n\nin the corresponding psychiatric evaluation.\u201d McRae I, 139 N.C. App. at 391,394, 533 S.E.2d at 560, 562. In this case, defendant\u2019s competence has never been assessed, let alone at a relevant time. Thus, it is clear that a retrospective determination of defendant\u2019s competence would not be possible here and we do not need to remand for the trial court to make such a determination. Because defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial has never been evaluated and \u201c[g]iven the inherent difficulties of such a nunc pro tunc determination under the most favorable circumstances, we cannot conclude that such a procedure would be adequate here.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 183, 43 L.Ed. 2d at 119-20 (citations omitted); see also Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 403, 4 L.Ed. 2d 824, 825 (1960) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s holding that appellant must present some evidence of a subsequent change in competency or some new evidence in a manner analogous to newly discovered evidence in a motion for new trial to complain of a denial of a second competency hearingrecognizing the difficulty of retrospectively determining the defendants competency as of more than a year ago and ordering a new trial and hearing as to the defendants present competenceholding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the state does not have to prove a defendants competency to stand trialholding that a trial court must conduct sua sponte a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendants competence & \n\nto as a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d in which we look to the record of conviction, including the indictment, plea, verdict, and sentence (or any other documents admissible under the federal regulations to prove a criminal conviction, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.41 (1995)) to determine whether the actual offense of which the alien was convicted qualifies as a crime of violence. See Ye v. INS, 214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000); Solorzano-Patlan v. INS, 207 F.3d 869, 875 (7th Cir.2000); Wadman v. INS, 329 F.2d 812, 814 (9th Cir.1964); see also Pichardo-Sufren, 21 I. & N. Dec. 330, 334 (BIA 1996)(en banc). The courts have emphasized that it is not what the alien did, but the crime of which he was convicted, determined by the record of conviction, that is dispositive. Ye v. INS, 214 F.3d at 1133 (<HOLDING>); In re Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I. & N. Dec. 323, holding that once the statute is found to be divisible the court must look to the charging papers and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual crime of which defendant was convicted was a crime of violence but emphasizing that the court is not to examine the particular facts underlying the convictionholding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16holding that a district court may not rely on a charging document without first establishing that the crime charged was the same crime for which the defendant was convictedrecognizing that a court may look to the charging document in making a crime of violence determination but only where the statute provides disjunctive methods of committing the offense and the court needs to determine which of the statutory alternatives is involved in the particular caseholding that courts should look to the statutory definition of the crime charged rather than the actual facts of the individuals prior conviction to determine whether the crime qualifies as a violent felony under the acca & \n\nIf the defendant perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law is satisfied, and only if the defendant is aware that his death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing. Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it. See Garrett v. Collins, 951 F.2d 57, 59 (5th Cir.1992) and Lowenfield v. Butler, 843 F.2d 183, 187 (5th Cir.1988) (both quoting and relying on this excerpt from Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in Ford, 477 U.S. at 422, 106 S.Ct. 2595 (Powell, J., concurring), in denying competency-to-be-executed habeas relief); see also Fearance, 56 F.3d at 640 and Barnard, 13 F.3d at 876 n. 2 (<HOLDING>). Counsel for Panetti suggests this Court holding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the standard for determining competency to plead guilty is whether the defendant has a rational understanding of the proceedingsholding that the fifth circuit has adopted the powell concurrence as the standard for competency to be executedholding that no exception to the invited error doctrine has ever been adopted by this circuitholding competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving right to counsel is same as competency standard for standing trial and disapproving contrary holding of masthers & \n\nanother.

Although \u201cbank robbery\" is not an expressly listed offense, separate from \u201crobbery,\u201d the Guidelines assume that \"robbery\u201d encompasses \"bank robbery.\" Under section 2B3.1 of the Guidelines, which assigns offense levels to various forms of \u201crobbery,\" a sentencing court is instructed to increase the offense level by a certain number of points \u201c[i]f the property of a financial institution ... was taken____\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(1) (1992). 5 .

Our observation in this regard might be read as implicitly questioning our decision in Baskin, 886 F.2d at 389 (<HOLDING>). We do not address the validity of Baskin in holding that robbery is a crime of violence for purposes of habitualoffender sentencingholding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16holding that a sentencing judge retains discretion to examine the underlying facts of a case in deciding whether an offense is a crime of violence under section 4b12holding that sexual abuse of a minor is a violent crime within the meaning of the sentencing guidelines and noting that definitions of crime of violence in 18 usc 16 and ussg 4b12 differ slightly finding reyescastro to be persuasive in its 4b12 analysisholding that once the statute is found to be divisible the court must look to the charging papers and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual crime of which defendant was convicted was a crime of violence but emphasizing that the court is not to examine the particular facts underlying the conviction & \n\nvalidity of the conviction is at issue, but because the jury needs to examine the circumstances of the offense (as well as any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or prior record) in order to decide intelligently the question of punishment. It is not error to inform the resentencing jury that the defendant has already been found guilty, and to tell the jury that its duty is to determine the punishment to be imposed, considering \u201call of the evidence\u201d presented at the resentencing trial, and \u201call of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d Transcript, Vol. 41 at 2851, 2857-59. See Alderman v. State, supra at 212 (11 b). 14. Potts complains of the state\u2019s use of a prior conviction for murder based on a guilty plea that was not shown to be voluntary. See Pope v. State, supra at 195 (17) (<HOLDING>). Potts raised before trial the issue of holding that once the defendant raises the issue of intelligent and voluntary waiver with respect to prior guilty pleas the burden is on the state to establish a valid waiverholding that record did not show voluntary or intelligent waiverrecognizing that the burden to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional right is upon the prosecutionholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nthe court should not have imposed an offense level of 34. He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit. This case is, thus, distinguishable from those in which courts declined to dismiss claims recognized under New Jersey local law, even though out-of-state plaintiffs might have been unable to pursue such causes of action under their own state\u2019s local law. In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree. See Boyes, supra, 27 F.Supp.2d at 547-48 (<HOLDING>); Smith v. Alza Corp., 400 N.J.Super. 529, recognizing new jerseys interest in deterrence of tortious misconduct as a relevant factor in choice of law decisions applicable where two of defendants were new jersey residents from whom damages were sought for their negligent acts in new jerseyrecognizing israel had no interest in denying its citizens the substantive advantages of new jersey defamation law in new jersey residents claims for defamation published in new jerseyholding that a writ of execution under new jersey law is not an action against the consumerrecognizing that pennsylvania had no interest in denying its residents the greater damages available under new jersey consumer fraud statutes for claims against a new jersey sellerrecognizing that alabama had no interest in denying its residents the procedural and substantive advantages afforded under new jerseys product liability and consumer fraud statutes but not alabamas for claims against a new jersey manufacturer & \n\nrequire a showing of actual harm when a plaintiff sues for willful violations.\u201d Robins v. Spokeo, Inc., 742 F.3d 409, 412 (9th Cir.2014). The court reasoned that when, as with the FCRA, \u201cthe statutory cause of action does not require proof of actual damages, a plaintiff can suffer a violation of the statutory right without suffering actual damages.\u201d Id. at 413; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A) (\u201cAny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed [under the FCRA] with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of \u2014 any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1000.\u201d (emphasis added); Bateman v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 623 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>); Montgomery v. Wells Fargo Bank, C12-3895 TEH, holding that irrespective of whether bateman and all the potential class members can demonstrate actual harm resulting from a willful violation of the fail and accurate credit transactions act they are entitled to statutory damagesholding that rule 23b2 calls for injunction as to all class members or to none of them and does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damagesholding that a plaintiff can seek statutory damages even in the absence of actual damagesholding that fdcpa statutory damages did not predominate over the requested equitable relief because given the defendants net worth and the number of class members each class member would be entitled to receive only 025 in statutory damagesholding that class certification is not appropriate because plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the calculation of individualized actual economic damages if any suffered by the class members can be performed in accordance with the predominance requirement of rule 23b3 & \n\nprocess to convict a defendant when he is legally incompetent. United States v. Mason, 52 F.3d 1286, 1289 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cCongress has safeguarded this [due process] right by providing that trial courts conduct competency hearings\u201d under specified circumstances. Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a)). Of relevance here, when neither party to a criminal trial moves for a competency hearing, the district court shall order such a hearing on its own motion[ ] if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense. \u00a7 4241(a); see also Mason, 52 F.3d at 1289 (<HOLDING>). Whether such reasonable cause exists, holding that the existence of probable cause in a 1983 case is a jury questionrecognizing the existence of the special relationshiprecognizing the cause of actionrecognizing that the existence of reasonable cause requires the sua sponte ordering of a competency hearingrecognizing cause of action & \n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel); Boag v. Raines, 769 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir.1985) (same). Valdez next argues that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the district court\u2019s sentence enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (firearm possession) and 3B1.1 (leader\/organizer). However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v. Willard, 919 F.2d 606, 609 (9th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, Valdez\u2019s sentence enhancement holding that the court cannot examine the underlying merits of the claims in determining whether to certify a classholding that a trial court has a duty to examine the entire record including all physical documentary evidence in order to reach an equitable resultholding that the trial court must examine the entire course of criminal conduct in determining possessionholding that for purposes of determining whether complete diversity exists a court must examine the plaintiffs pleading as of the time of the petition for removaiholding that court must examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless & \n\nthe evidence of childhood abuse could have easily raised inferences that evoked sympathy for the eighteen-year-old Cox. Such evidence could have explained why Cox ended up in a gang and how Cox ended up in a position where he was aiding Williams in the perpetration of the murders. Indeed, one of Cox\u2019s attorneys acknowledged that the omitted childhood abuse' evidence \u201cwould have been helpful to [the] defense\u201d and \u201cconsistent with the themes that [they] presented in mitigation.\u201d Where, as here, \u201ccounsel offers no strategic reason for failing to perform what would otherwise constitute the duty of a reasonably competent counsel, we may not invent such a strategy by engaging in a \u2018post hoc rationalization of counsel\u2019s conduct\u2019.\u201d See Richter v. Hickman, 578 F.3d 944, 959 (9th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, the Supreme Court has acknowledged holding that the defendant could not establish prejudice for trial counsels failure to hire an expert when the experts testimony would not have changed the nature of the states evidenceholding that counsels strategic decisions were hard to attackholding counsels failure to object to victim impact testimony and evidence was not ineffective assistance of counsel when the trial record was silent as to counsels strategyholding that the failure to inform the defendant of his right to a sixperson jury and the failure to consult the defendant as to his wishes was an error for which a new trial was the only remedyholding that counsels failure to consult blood experts was not a strategic choice because counsel offered no reasoned explanation for the failure & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N. LaSalle, 190 B.R. at 585 (noting \u201cthe lack of any clear standard for determining the fairness of a discrimination in the treatment of classes under a chapter 11 plan\u201d and that \u201cthe limits of fairness in this context have not been established\u201d). Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\n(7)(f) or other discovery under N.D.R.Crim.P. 16, but the defendant is not under obligation to do so. The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v. Anderson, 303 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1981) (<HOLDING>). The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\nweapon was not recovered, Martin confirmed during the interview that the toolbox police found in Jacey\u2019s vehicle was his, and that he threw the hammer he used to kill Jacey into a river. Thereafter, Martin hid Jacey\u2019s body in the bushes and proceeded to use her vehicle and other belongings until he was apprehended by law enforcement nine days later. Moreover, the trial court found two other aggravators in addition to CCP: (1) commission by a convicted felon and one who is under a sentence of felony probation; and (2) committed during the course of a robbery. This Court has affirmed the imposition of death as a proportionate penalty when a finding of CCP was coupled with other aggravators in addition to multiple mitigating factors. See Mosley v. State, 46 So.3d 510, 527-29 (Fla.2009) (<HOLDING>); Zakrzewski v. State, 717 So.2d 488, 494 holding death sentence proportionate where defendant murdered wife and children and trial court found three aggravators previous capital felony ccp and hac and two statutory mitigators extreme disturbance and no prior criminal historyholding death penalty proportionate where the trial court found ccp and three other aggravators and twentynine nonstatutory mitigatorsholding imposition of the death penalty proportionate where the trial court found two aggravating circumstances ccp and contemporaneous murder two statutory mitigating factors and a number of nonstatutory mitigating factorsholding death penalty proportionate where there were two aggravating factorsthe murder was committed for pecuniary gain and defendant had been convicted of a prior violent felonyand where there were two statutory and three nonstatutory mitigating circumstancesholding death penalty proportionate where there were two aggravating factors avoiding arrest and commission during course of a burglary with some nonstatutory mitigation & \n\ncrime of violence under the elements clause. As a result, there is no need to reach the constitutionality of Section 924(c)(3)(B)\u2019s residual clause. See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]f a case can be decided on either of two grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will decide only the latter.\u201d). The determination of whether a predicate offense is a crime of violence under the elements clause is not made on the facts of the specific allegations against a defendant, but is instead made categorically based on the elements of the offense. See Aguilar v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the United States, 663 F.3d 692, 695 (3d Cir. 2011) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Butler, 496 Fed.Appx. 158, holding that sexual assault of a child qualified as crime of violence under 18 usc 16holding that the categorical approach applies to the identical definition of crime of violence in 18 usc 16holding that the categorical approach applies to 924cholding dui causing serious bodily injury is not a crime of violence under 18 usc 16holding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16 & \n\nthe Army argues that the two jobs are not identical and Nealon failed to present \u201ccomparable worth\u201d evidence below. However, it is for the district court to determine on the merits whether the two jobs are sufficiently similar to find an EPA violation; Nealon. was never permitted to offer evidence on the merits because her suit was dismissed before trial, on the Army\u2019s motion. B. Finally, Nealon argues that the fact that her favorable EEOC I decision was issued during the limitations period, in October 1987, warrants equitable tolling of the statute of limitations period. We agree. As a general matter, statutory time limits in suits against the government are subject to equitable tolling principles. See Irwin v. Veterans Administration, \u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (<HOLDING>). Loe v. Heckler, 768 F.2d 409 (D.C.Cir.1985), holding that the filing deadline under title vii is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court but a requirement that like a statute of limitations is subject to waiver estoppel and equitable tollingholding claims based on title vii subject to arbitrationholding as subject to equitable tolling title vii statute authorizing suit brought within 90 days of receipt of right to sue noticeholding title vii subject to equitable tollingholding that the 120day filing period is subject to equitable tolling and addressing circumstances warranting equitable tolling & \n\nsurely not what the Legislature intends. The dissenting opinion contends that the literal wording of the statute unambiguously provides a strategic tool to the accused. We disagree. Nowhere in the statute are the words \"strategic tool\u201d used, and this interpretation is contradicted by the fact that only one shuffle is authorized and it can be effected by either the defendant or the State. The dissent further contends that we recognized in Wilkerson v. State, 681 S.W.2d 29 (Tex.Crim.App.1984) that providing such a strategic tool was \"the very intent behind the passage of the statute.\u201d However, the case actually said that the legislative intent would be thwarted if a trial court's sua sponte shuffle foreclosed the State or a defendant from effecting one.

This is because a \u201cprevailing plaintiff ... should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d Barrios, 277 F.3d at 1134 (9th Cir.2002). The Ninth Circuit has held that an ADA plaintiff is a prevailing party if she: (1) \u201cachieve[s] a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d; and (2) that alteration is \u201cjudicially sanctioned.\u201d Jankey v. Poop Deck, 537 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir.2008). The second requirement can be met in many ways, including when a party enters into a legally enforceable agreement with the defendant. Barrios v.

However, under the extreme circumstances described by Ms. Wright, who wa pite the evidence of rape described above, the jury was unauthorized to find that a rape had occurred because Ms. Wright did not report the rape early in her interactions with investigators. We find this argument unpersuasive for four reasons. First, a rape conviction is not unauthorized under the law simply because the victim chooses not to report the rape immediately. See Watson v.

In reviewing a question of law, an appellate court reaches a conclusion independent of the lower court\u2019s ruling. In re Estate of Stull, supra, citing Goff-Hamel v. Obstetricians & Gyns., P.C., 256 Neb. 19, 588 N.W.2d 798 (1999). ANALYSIS On appeal, Muff and Lauridsen argue that the county court erred in awarding Thomsen fees because there is no such office as an attorney for an estate and, secondly, because at all times Thomsen was proceeding contrary to Tucker\u2019s expressed desires and wishes. Ordinarily, the right of an attorney to compensation for his or her services depends upon a contract of employment, express or implied. In re Estate of Stull, supra. See, also, Doyle v. Union Ins. Co., 209 Neb. 385, 308 N.W.2d 322 (1981) (<HOLDING>). In Doyle v. Union Ins. Co., supra, the holding that attorneys claim for professional services against person sui juris or against property of such person must rest upon contract of employment express or implied made with person sought to be charged or with his agentholding that under the applicable statutory provisions a person need not be impoverished or devoid of all assets to qualify as an indigent sick person but only that the person be unable to pay for necessary medical careholding that burglary may qualify as offense against person if as committed it is in fact a crime against a personholding that a person is seized for purposes of article i section 7 of the hawaii constitution when a police officer approaches that person for the express or implied purpose of investigating him or her for possible criminal violations and begins to ask for informationholding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victim & \n\noriginal intended purpose requirement. Indeed, two of the words, \u201crepair\u201d and \u201crefurbish,\u201d lend themselves most naturally to an interpretation that an item will retain its originally intended purpose. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 1923 (2002) (defining \u201crepair\u201d as \u201cto restore by replacing a part or putting together what is torn or broken\u201d (emphasis added)); id. at 1910 (defining \u201crefurbish\u201d as \u201cto make as if new\u201d); see also In re Mallo, 774 F.3d 1313, 1321 (10th Cir.2014) (recognizing that we interpret words using their ordinary and common meanings). And there is nothing about any of the other three words, \u201cresold,\u201d \u201cdonated,\u201d and \u201creused,\u201d that excludes an original intended purpose requirement. See, e.g., Webster\u2019s at 672 (defining \u201cdonate\u201d as \u201cto make 05) (<HOLDING>). But see Tebbetts v.

To justify an offense level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), the district court had to find that Defendant possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d The additional felony offense identified by the district court, in this case, was kidnapping. See Cummings v. State, 968 P.2d 821, 832 (Okla.Crim.App.1998) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

Smith, 206 N.W.2d 311, 315 (Iowa 1973))). Rule 5.702 does not impose a requirement for how an expert is to become qualified and does not distinguish between whether an expert is qualified or unqualified based on whether he or she belongs to a particular profession or has a particular degree. Ranes, 778 N.W.2d at 689; see also Hutchison, 514 N.W.2d at 888 (<HOLDING>).

Statutes providing for forfeiture of driving privileges or punishment for habitual violations of the traffic statutes are designed to protect the public from persons who have demonstrated that they are unable to obey traffic laws established for the safety of citizens and that their driving presents a hazard to life and property. See Owens v. State (1978), 178 Ind.App. 406, 382 N.E.2d 1312, 1314-1315. The absence of limiting language in L.C. 9-30-10-16 reveals the legislature's recognition that the danger to the public is equally as great on private property used by the public, such as shopping center parking lots and apartment complex roads, as it is on public highways. See Huey v. State (1987), Ind.App., 503 N.E.2d 623, 626-627 (<HOLDING>). Guidry contends that if .C. 9-30-10-16 is holding that corpus delicti of dwi is that someone drove or operated motor vehicle in public place while intoxicatedholding that indianas operating while intoxicated statute which states that a person who operates a vehicle while intoxicated commits a class a misdemeanor is not limited to operation of motor vehicles on public highwaysholding that misdemeanor offense of driving while intoxicated constitutes a crime of violence under ussg 4b12aholding dwi intoxicated operation of a motor vehicle in a public place is clearly not a crime of violence under 18 usc 16bholding that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the defendants conviction for operating a vehicle while intoxicated causing death as a class c felony & \n\n1983 assault trial in Baltimore City defined assault, under Maryland law, as \u201ca threat by words or acts or both to do bodily harm to another, coupled with the apparent present ability to carry out the threat.\u201d In light of that instruction, the jury, in finding Wardrick guilty of common-law assault, convicted him of a violent felony; i.e., the guilty verdict had \u201cas an element the ... threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). The district court also properly characterized Wardrick\u2019s 1984 Maryland conviction for escape as a violent felony. As we have indicated, felony escape and attempted escape constitute violent felonies under ACCA- \u2014 even if accomplished by stealth. See generally United States v. Hairston, 71 F.3d 115 (4th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Aragon, 983 F.2d 1306, 1313 holding walkaway escape under north dakota statute a crime of violenceholding felony escape in north carolina to be crime of violence under acca because escape presents risk of injury to othersholding that in light of our recognition that escape presents a continuing threat of violence until the escapee is safely returned to custody we hold that for purposes of 2k21b5 every escape is sufficiently continuing such that possession of a gun subsequent to the initial departure from custody can qualify as being in connection with the escapeholding that an escape from custody under minnesota law is a crime of violenceholding that escape is categorically a violent felony under the acca & \n\nFed.Reg. 68,722 at 68,724-25 (\u201cAlthough water quality problems also can occur from agricultural storm water discharges and return flows from irrigated agriculture, this area of concern is statutorily exempted from regulation as a point source under the Clean Water Act.\u201d). Plaintiffs argue unpersuasively that the Clean Water Act\u2019s exemptions for irrigated agriculture are inapplicable to defendant\u2019s operations because defendant\u2019s possible over-application of fruit processing wastewater to its crops is more akin to industrial, non-agricultural activities. The only case to support this position was decided seven years before Congress added the exemption for agricultural runoff to the Clean Water Act. United States v. Oxford Royal Mushroom Products, Inc., 487 F.Supp. 852, 854 (E.D.Pa.1980) (<HOLDING>); see Pub.L. 100-4, Title V, \u00a7\u00a7 502(a), 503 holding that a period of paid leave does not qualify as a suspensionholding that the defendants evidence did not qualify as newly discovered evidenceholding that the spraying of an overabundance of wastewater onto irrigation fields may qualify as a point sourceholding negligence on the part of the attorney does not qualify for such reliefholding that the department of transportation may be enjoined from diverting water flow onto a landowners property & \n\na record cannot qualify as a business record if it was prepared for purposes of litigation. See, e.g., United States v. Feliz, 467 F.3d 227, 234 (2d Cir.2006). But where a document is created primarily for the government to use it as a substitute for live testimony in a criminal prosecution, the fact that the document might happen to fall within the jurisdiction\u2019s business records exception to the hearsay rule does not render the document non-testimonial. Accordingly, because DEA chemist\u2019s reports are created expressly for use in criminal prosecutions as a substitute for live testimony against the accused, such reports are testimonial, whether or not they happen to meet this jurisdiction\u2019s definition of a business record. See State v. Caulfield, 722 N.W.2d 304, 309-10 (Minn.2006) (<HOLDING>). ' Citing Howard, 473 A.2d at 839, the holding that bureau of criminal apprehension bca laboratory report identifying a substance as cocaine was testimonial and implicated defendants right to confrontationholding that state bureau of criminal apprehension laboratory report offered at trial to prove that substance seized from defendant was cocaine was clearly prepared for litigation and was testimonialholding forensic laboratory experts statement that substance was cocaine is testimonial for sixth amendment confrontation clause purposesholding that fdle lab report reflecting that substances possessed by defendant were marijuana and cocaine was testimonial as such document was accusatory was prepared by law enforcement pursuant to a police investigation and was admitted to establish an element of the crimerecognizing that evidence regarding the high price the defendant had paid for the substance in question was relevant to show the substance was cocaine & \n\nhis sentence. Hanson advised appellate counsel that he would like to contest the application of \u00a7 4B1.4 to his case, which resulted in a higher offense level and longer sentence because Hanson was classified as an armed career criminal. Hanson forfeited this objection by not raising it in the district court, and so we would review the court\u2019s determination only for plain error. United States v. Williams, 258 F.3d 669, 672 (7th Cir.2001). We could find no error here, plain or otherwise, because Harris has two convictions for burglary, and convictions for sexual intercourse without consent and for escape. Counsel is correct that these convictions qualify as violent felonies under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). See Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Brown, 273 F.3d 747, 750 holding a burglary must be of a building or structure in order to qualify as a violent felony for acca purposesholding that attempted burglary as defined by florida law is a violent felony under accaholding that burglary is violent felonyholding that escape from secure custody is a violent felonyholding that coerced sex is violent felony & \n\nor death shall be applica ble for the full period during which compensation is payable.\u201d In this case, the trial court awarded the employee TTD benefits of $771 per week from December 21, 2012, to July 1, 2013, which was the average weekly wage in effect at the time of the employee\u2019s accident, but $788 per week from July 1, 2013 .to January 28, 2014, .based upon the director\u2019s determination of the average weekly wage of the state as of July 1, 2013. The employer contends, and the employee concedes, that the increase in. the TTD benefits from July 1, 2013, mandated by the trial court was contrary to \u00a7 25-5- d for review was final and ordered that the petition would instead be treated as an appeal. See generally Ex parte Lowe's Home Ctrs., LLC, 209 So.3d 496, 502 (Ala.Civ.App.2016) (<HOLDING>). Because the trial court\u2019s ruling was a final holding that if a trial court enters a judgment finding that an injury is compensable ordering payment for medical treatment and awarding temporarytotaldisability benefits regardless of whether the amount of those benefits is specified in the judgment this court will treat such a judgment as final for purposes of appealholding that order finding that injury arose out of and in the course of the employment and awarding medical benefits was interlocutory order that would not support appealholding that an order not denominated a judgment is not final for purposes of appealholding that even an order that establishes entitlement to a judgment is not final unless it actually enters or renders a judgment or includes specific language of finality necessary for a judgment to be considered final for purposes of an appealholding trial court may make a judgment final for purposes of appeal by severing the causes and parties disposed of by the judgment into a different cause & \n\nwarnings. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Chapman, 388 N.E.2d 541, 553 (Ind. Ct. App. 1979). The court reasoned that the competency of an expert witness has never been limited to only those facts he or she has learned from personal demonstration. Instead, the court explained, \"where a witness exhibits such a degree of knowledge, gained from experiments, observation, standard books, or other reliable source, as to make it appear that his opinion is of some value, he is entitled to testify.\" Id. Exide cites several cases as support for the proposition that \"mere practical knowledge and frequent use of a product does not qualify the user as an expert on ... warnings.\" However, none of these cases support this proposition. See, e.g., McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., 981 F.2d 656 (2nd Cir. 1992) (<HOLDING>); Silva v. American Airlines, Inc., 960 F. holding that warnings given to a witness by the trial court and the prosecutor concerning the possibility that testifying could place the witness in jeopardy of revocation of his plea agreement and charges of perjury or false statement did not violate the defendants due process rights because the warnings merely corroborated in a straightforward and nonthreatening manner the information given by the witness attorneyholding witness was not qualified to opine on the adequacy of the warnings of a specialized glue because he lacked expertise in either the product was not a chemical engineer toxicologist or an environmental engineer or the design of warning labelsholding that district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony of mechanical engineer in products liability case involving automobile because expert did not have specific experience regarding subject matter of lawsuitholding that the shape of a product was not an advertising idea because there was no allegation in the complaint that the design itself was a trademark or was intended to distinguish the product from others that might enter the market citation omittedholding that it was not an abuse of discretion for district court to allow a mechanical engineer to give expert testimony about a machine with which the engineer had no design experience & \n\nJoint neither withheld nor paid payroll taxes or employment taxes for Mr. Weaver, and Mr. Weaver was issued an IRS Form 1099 at the end of each year. Joint, however, maintains that it considered Mr. Weaver to be an independent agent for tax purposes only. In May 2011, Mr. Weaver terminated the Agreement. Joint filed the First Lawsuit two months later. Mr. Weaver moved for summary on Joint\u2019s contract claims. He asserted the Agreement was illegal (and therefore unenforceable under Oklahoma law) because Joint paid him as an independent contractor to induce patient referrals for the furnishing of Medicare\/Medicaid-covered equipment, in violation the Medicare Anti-Kickback Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). See United States v. McClatchey, 217 F.3d 823, 835 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Joint countered that the Agreement was legal holding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victimholding that a threat to harm another person is a crime of violenceholding that a person who offers or pays remuneration to another person violates the act so long as one purpose of the offer or payment is to induce medicare or medicaid patient referralsholding that attorneys claim for professional services against person sui juris or against property of such person must rest upon contract of employment express or implied made with person sought to be charged or with his agentholding that a state was embraced within the meaning of the word person where the word person was defined as meaning and including a partnership association company or corporation as well as a natural person & \n\nCURIAM. Petitioner Thomas Alfred Brydon appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition for relief. We affirm. Brydon pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture methamphetamine. At sentencing, the district court applied the career-offender provisions of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 & 4B1.2. The court determined that four prior Iowa convictions for operating a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent and one prior Iowa conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated qualified as predicate crimes of violence. Subsequently, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (<HOLDING>). Later, in United States v. Steward, 598 F.3d holding a felony conviction for driving while intoxicated dwi may be a crime of violenceholding for the purposes of 18 usc 924e that being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a violent felony as defined in 18 usc 924e2bholding that statute prohibiting driving while intoxicated applied to defendant driving on a private parking lotholding that driving while intoxicated is not a violent felony pursuant to 18 usc 924e2bholding that burglary is violent felony & \n\ncontinuing. {21} Defendant further argues that this order was an acquittal on the refusal basis for aggravated DWI, apparently under the theory that it somehow finalized or solemnized the trial court\u2019s oral comme implicated in this case. The Ratchford exception is limited to an oral grant of a new trial being effective to defeat automatic denial provisions built into the rules of criminal procedure. 115 N.M. at 570-71, 855 P.2d at 559-60. The cases involving discharge of a jury can be distinguished because in those cases the proceedings were terminated and the fact-finder was discharged by the oral comments of the judge, while here, proceedings were ongoing and the court expressly reserved ruling on the aggravated DWI charge. Rodriguez, 2004-NMCA-125, \u00b6 14, 136 N.M. 494, 100 P.3d 200 (<HOLDING>); Reyes-Arreola, 1999-NMCA-086, \u00b6 10, 127 N.M. holding part performance of an oral agreement necessary to take the oral agreement out of the statute of frauds must be consistent only with the existence of the alleged oral contractholding that a delinquency proceeding places a juvenile in jeopardy for purposes of the double jeopardy clauseholding that oral declarations of mistrial which discharge the jury are unlike other oral decisions by the trial court which are not binding and are subject to change until a final written order or judgment is enteredholding that defendant did not breach oral agreement because among other things the plaintiff had not established that the term in question was part of the oral contractholding that oral discharge of jury terminated jeopardy & \n\ndesigned to impair their opportunity to seek legal redress. Plaintiffs further claim that the City\u2019s actions were arbitrary and irrational (substantive due process violation). Defendants respond that the City\u2019s decision to grant the special use permit was a rational exercise of its discretion, and plaintiffs were afforded adequate opportunity to be heard. B. Jurisdiction This court has appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An appellate court reviews a grant of sum mary judgment de novo. Smith v. Ameritech, 129 F.3d 857 (6th Cir.1997). C. Procedural Due Process 1. A person\u2019s right not be deprived of property without due process of law is a fundamental tenet of federal constitutional law. See Boddie v. Connecticut, 401 U.S. 371, 379, 91 S.Ct. 780, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971) (<HOLDING>). Here, plaintiffs allege a number of ways in holding that in order to prove a denial of due process a party must show that he was arbitrarily and capriciously deprived of a cognizable property interest rooted in state lawholding that privileges licenses certificates and franchises qualify as property interests for purposes of procedural due process but that due process only becomes relevant where such property is deprivedholding that an alien is not deprived of due process if he or she receives actual notice of a denial of an application to withhold deportationholding that although the parking citation that the plaintiff received did not indicate where and how to contest the allegation the plaintiff was not deprived of procedural due process because he received a summons to appear in court via first class mail before he was deprived of any liberty interestholding that the root requirement of due process is that an individual be given an opportunity for a hearing before he is deprived of any significant property interest & \n\ncase here, where part of the merchandise is fragile glass. 14 . Both GRI 2(a) and GRI 3(b) employ the term \"essential character,\u201d but in rather different contexts. As explained above, GRI 2(a) provides that \"[a]ny reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete ..., provided that, as entered, the incomplete ... article has the essential character of the complete ... article.\" GRI 2(a) (emphasis added). In contrast, GRI 3(b) provides, in relevant part, that mixtures, composite goods, and sets \"which cannot be classified by reference to 3(a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential 20 CIT 793, 800-01, 932 F.Supp. 1499, 1504-05 (1996), aff'd, 122 F.3d 1446 (Fed.Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, if the test for \"essential holding that where the gri 3a rule of relative specificity adequately resolved proper classification of merchandise customs erred in reaching gri 3b essential character analysisholding that where the parties fail to reach an agreement as to the character nature or type of release to be used an essential element of the agreement is not establishedholding that even though an agreement was approved by the family court it retained its character as an agreement for purposes of legal analysisholding that for purposes of gri 2a essential character analysis it is the ability to process data that gives the essential character to articles under a tariff provision covering automatic data processing machines and units thereofholding that for purposes of gri 2a essential character analysis incomplete merchandise as imported does not have the essential character of the complete or finished article the ability to strain salt from water and thus cannot be classified as straining cloth & \n\nplainly stated that, \u201c[i]n exchange for the benefits offered by Amtrak, [CO] agrees ... not to seek employment with Amtrak in the future.\u201d (Ford Deck, Ex. 46 at 2.) Plaintiff was not similarly situated to CO in all material respects. Accordingly, because plaintiff has not offered any evidence that Amtrak treated similarly situated employees in a more favorable manner upon termination, her evidence regarding her severance package does not demonstrate that defendants\u2019 proffered explanation for her termination is mere pretext for racial or gender discrimination. 7. Disparate duties and opportunities Plaintiff claims she was fired because Porter set her up to fail. While this allegation is conclusory and speculative and does not create a genuine issue of mater 3, 408 (N.D.Ga.1989) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to Porter and Green\u2019s contention holding that a state is not a person within the meaning of 1983holding that a person is seized when a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leaveholding that in a 1981 case it not controlling that a black person is suing a black personholding that burglary may qualify as offense against person if as committed it is in fact a crime against a personholding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victim & \n\nL.Ed. 1356 (1953). Plaintiff argues the Supreme Court in Haddle v. Garrison, 525 U.S. 121, 119 S.Ct. 489, 142 L.Ed.2d 502 (1998), implicitly considered and rejected the intracorpo-rate conspiracy doctrine\u2019s application to Section 1985 by allowing an employee to bring a Section 1985(2) action against his employer and its officers. Plaintiff misconstrues the scope and holding of Haddle. Although Haddle involved a Section 1985(2) action alleging conspiracy among an employer and its officers, the intracor-porate conspiracy issue was not considered. The Supreme Court made clear its review was \u201cconfined to one question: Can petitioner state a claim for damages by alleging that a conspiracy. proscribed by \u00a7 1985( ction 1985 claims. See Dombrowski v. Dowling, 459 F.2d 190, 196 (7th Cir.1972) (<HOLDING>). The Circuits are divided over whether holding that evidence contrary to an administrators decision does not make the decision arbitrary and capricious so long as a reasonable basis appears for the decisionholding that when two executives of the same firm make a decision to discriminate in furtherance of the purposes of the business this decision cannot be called a conspiracy for purposes of 1985holding that the conspiracy theory of personal jurisdiction requires that the outofstate coconspirator was or should have been aware of the acts performed in the forum state in furtherance of the conspiracyholding that it was immaterial for conflict of interest purposes whether one attorney or two attorneys in the same firm represented the witness and the defendantholding that in a conspiracy case venue lies where the conspiracy agreement was formed or in any jurisdiction where an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy was committed by any of the conspirators & \n\n"}

But in analyzing a judicial deception claim, we need not scrutinize police investigative tactics in this fashion. 10 . As discussed above, the materiality of an omission is an issue for the court. 11 . The Ewings quote Shirk's testimony from Prater and Memory's trial, but the officers obviously did not have this information at the time they prepared the warrant affidavit. The Ewings also fault the officers for not asking Shirk more questions, such as whether he had been drinking, how long he looked at the female, whether her helmet face shield was up or down, and what the lighting conditions were. But judicial deception claims do not require an inquiry into the quality of the police investigation. See generally Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-36, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (<HOLDING>). 12 . After the Ewings' arrest, Contreras did holding that allegations in a pro se complaint are to be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the complaint submitted by a pro se plaintiff must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the allegations in a pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersrecognizing that because affidavits are typically drafted in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation by nonlawyers they must be read with an understanding of that context and accordingly held to a lower standard of scrutiny than that applied to pleadings filed in more formal proceedingsholding that affidavits for search warrants must be interpreted in a commonsense and realistic fashion because they are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation & \n\nI believe the obligation to prove a knowing and willful violation of Maryland's licensing law is clear from the plain language of \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(A) and the Maryland law it references, I reject the Talebnejads\u2019 argument that \u00a7 1960(b)(1)(A) is void for vagueness. See United States v. Klecker, 348 F.3d 69, 71 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that penal statutes define crimes so that ordinary people can understand the conduct prohibited and so that arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is not encouraged.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Even if the different scienter requirements made the statute ambiguous, I would reach the same result through applying the rule of lenity. See United States v. Lanier, 520 U.S. 259, 266, 117 S.Ct. 1219, 137 L.Ed.2d 432 (1997) (<HOLDING>). A knowing and willful violation of Maryland's recognizing that the rule of lenity only applies if after considering text structure history and purpose there remains a grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the statute such that the court must simply guess as to what congress intendedholding that the rule of lenity applies to sentencing guidelinesrecognizing that the rule of lenity applies not only to interpretations of the substantive ambit of criminal prohibitions but also to the penalties they imposeholding rule of lenity in the penal context to be a rule of last resortholding that the rule of lenity ensures fair warning by so resolving ambiguity in a criminal statute as to apply it only to conduct clearly covered & \n\nnotice to or the presence of either attorney and without any formal record. Her later questioning of the two officers on the stand may have brought some of the substance of this in-chambers interview into formal evidence, but, as with her call to the pharmacy manager, it is impossible for this Court to know what further information may have been shared behind the closed doors of chambers. Thus, it is impossible to adequately review whether or not the private conversation inappropriately affected the judge\u2019s decision. This fact highlights one of the reasons ex parte contacts with a judge are impermissible when they address a matter pending before the judge: They leave no record for the reviewing court on appeal. See Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Shannon, 356 N.W.2d 175, 179 (Wis. 1984) (<HOLDING>). \u00b6 18. Our Code of Judicial Conduct supports holding that after review the minutes were unambiguous and the trial judge erred in admitting parol evidenceholding that trial judge sitting as finder of fact erred by making unnoticed and unrecorded visit to accident scene because in part such actions are outside the record and therefore beyond this courts reach in its reviewholding that a challenge to the proper weight of the evidence is a question of fact outside this courts jurisdictionholding that the issue of proximate causation involves application of law to fact which should be left to the fact finder subject to limited reviewholding that this court will not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative fact finder who heard the testimony and was in a position to evaluate the credibility of witnesses because evidence is weighed by the administrative agency and not by the courts & \n\ndefendants also say that the prosecution presented false evidence to the grand jury in order to secure an indictment. We have reviewed the evidence and conclude that there is no evidence to indicate that the government\u2019s testimony and evidence before the grand jury was false. The majority of the arguments presented by the defendants go to the weight and interpretations of the evidence, instead of demonstrating actual false statements made by the government. In addition, many of the arguably false statements appear to be about information that is not material to the case. The Ninth Circuit appears to focus on the materiality of statements when analyzing whether there has been government misconduct that warrants sanctions. See United States v. Kennedy, 564 F.2d 1329, 1338 (9th Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>) Post-Indictment The second argument focus on holding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding that tribal courts are not subject to the fifth amendments requirement of indictment by grand juryholding that the trial court erred in denying the defendants motion in arrest of judgment when the indictment lacked a material element and it was not apparent that the grand jury based the indictment on facts that satisfy this element of the crime and that the only permissible cure was to send the matter back to the grand juryrecognizing that a constructive amendment to an indictment occurs when either the government the court or both broadens the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand juryholding that in the situation of a possible dismissal of an indictment because of possible grand jury tampering only where knowing perjury relating to a material matter has been presented to the grand jury should the trial judge dismiss an otherwise valid indictment & \n\nno matter how meager or unlikely. Manuel v. State, 667 So.2d 590, 593 (Miss.1995). A lesser-included-offense instruction should be granted where there is an evidentiary basis in the record for it. Lee v. State, 469 So.2d 1225, 1230 (Miss.1985). \u201c[T]he evidence in a particular case generally warrants granting a lesser offense instruction if a \u2018rational\u2019 or a \u2018reasonable\u2019 jury could find the defendant not guilty of the principal offense charged in the indictment yet guilty of the lesser included offense.\u201d Monroe v. State, 515 So.2d 860, 863 (Miss.1987). Common sense dictates that if someone resists too strongly it becomes an assault, and therefore, resisting arrest is clearly a lesser-included-offense of simple assault on an officer. Murrell v. State, 655 So.2d 881, 886 (Miss.1995) (<HOLDING>). \u00b6 5. Officer Gray testified that there was a holding that force exerted against an officer after an arrest is complete cannot be used as the basis for prosecuting one for resisting arrestholding that resisting arrest is lesser offense of assault on an officerholding that merger did not apply because sexual assault was not a lesser included offense of seconddegree kidnapping involving sexual assaultholding avoiding arrest is not the same as resisting arrestholding simple assault is a lesser included offense of recklessly endangering another person & \n\nto the carrier or fund. Here, Libner does not allege that he directly notified the Association of the existence of the lien. He asserts that the Association should have been on notice as a result of his relationship with his client, his communications with the Association on behalf of that client, and the Association\u2019s receipt of a copy of a letter Libner sent to his client indicating that he had a right to recover his fees. [\u00b6 11] Without deciding whether, and in what circumstance, an attorney may impose a lien against the fund of the opposing party or its carriers, we conclude that no lien may be imposed without direct and specific notice to the carrier or fund that a lien is asserted before the proceeds are disbursed. See Sowder v. Sowder, 127 N.M. 114, 977 P.2d 1034, 1038 (1999) (<HOLDING>). [\u00b6 12] Because Libner failed to provide any holding that no lien may be imposed without direct and specific notice to the fund of an opposing party or its carriers that a lien is asserted before the proceeds are disbursedholding that the constitutional right to be present is satisfied so long as the defendant is given an opportunity to register his opinions with counsel after juror questioning and is present when the exercise of strikes is given formal effect even if the defendant is not present when his lawyer actually exercises the peremptory challengesholding that if an attorney seeks to assert a lien but does so only after distribution of the proceeds of the judgment his notice even if given to all appropriate parties is too late and the hen is lostholding that if no notice was given prior to the institution of an action a condition precedent to the right to bring the action does not exist and the buyerplaintiff has lost the right of his remedyholding that if an attorney is discharged without cause he is entitled to a charging lien for the reasonable value of his services rendered prior to the date of the substitution of counsel where 1 his representation was entirely competent and successful up until his discharge 2 any potential conflict of interest was disclosed and the plaintiff chose to continue to be represented by the attorney and 3 the discharge of the attorney occurred solely because of a fee dispute & \n\nthe Department, and went on to hold that the Department\u2019s seizure of the vessel violated state law but that it was immune from damages. In no place in the opinion did the court discuss the award of attorneys\u2019 fees or intimate that such fees had ever been awarded. It was simply silent on the issue. Because no separate judgment has been \u201centered\u201d under Rule 58, the time for filing a notice of appeal has not yet begun to run. See Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7) (providing that a judgment or order is \u201centered ... when it is entered in compliance with Rules 58\u201d). Given that the district court treated the order allowing attorneys\u2019 fees as an appealable order and that the parties do not object to treating it as such, we find no reason to remand for formal compliance with Rule 58. Domegan, 972 F.2d 401 (<HOLDING>), vacated on other grounds, 507 U.S. 956, 113 holding that there was appellate jurisdiction under principle that a premature notice of appeal from a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a final judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and the appellee suffers no prejudiceholding that court had jurisdiction where no separate judgment had been entered even though notice of appeal was not timely filed as measured from the final decisionholding that a notice of appeal is timely when filed before final judgment is entered by the district courtholding that lack of a separate judgment does not preclude the taking of an appeal from a district courts final decision because the parties may waive the separate judgment requirement where one has accidentally not been enteredholding that notice of appeal was not effectively taken where appeal was filed simultaneously with timely motion for reconsideration because when timely motion for reconsideration is filed a notice of appeal filed prior to disposition of the motion to reconsider has no effect & \n\ndecision that Detective Clark was not entitled to rely in good faith on the warrant issued by the commissioner. Whether a law enforcement officer reasonably relied upon a subsequently invalidated search warrant is a legal question which we review de novo. See United States v. Koerth, 312 F.3d 862, 865 (7th Cir.2002). A. The Foundations and Purpose of the Exclusionary Rule Simply stated, \u201c[t]he exclusionary rule operates to prevent the Government from using evidence seized as the result of an illegal search in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\u201d United States v. McGough, 412 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2005). It has existed, in some form, as part of our constitutional jurisprudence for over one hundred years. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 638, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886) (<HOLDING>). Although commentators have articulated holding statute requiring parties in tax suit to take notice of subsequent pleadings was not unconstitutional when city failed to take such noticeholding that where it was erroneous for the district court to take judicial notice it certainly cannot be said that such notice was mandatory and therefore ire 201d is inapplicableholding that a notice to produce personal papers was unconstitutional and void and that the inspection by the district attorney of said invoice when produced in obedience to said notice and its admission in evidence by the court were erroneous and unconstitutional proceedingsholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitionerholding that a defendant is not entitled to relief from default judgment because notice to an attorney of filing of motions and orders is constructive notice to the client even when the client did not have actual notice & \n\napplicable here, and supports our conclusion that the language of the ballot title and summary do not constitute political or emotional rhetoric. Moreover, the common definition of the term \u201cprotect\u201d is \u201cto maintain the status or integrity of.\u201d Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 938 (10th ed.1998). This common definition, when read in context and conjunction with the rest of the language contained in the ballot title and summary accurately portrays the chief purpose of the amendment \u2014 preserving the current concept of marriage in Florida as the legal union of one man and one woman. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the ballot summary and title in the instant proposal are not impermissibly misleading, nor are they \u201cclearly and conclusively defective.\u201d Askew, 421 So.2d at 154 (<HOLDING>). REVIEW OF FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT Article holding that language in a citizen initiative must be clearly and conclusively defective to justify removal of the measure from the ballotholding that the defendants filing of a notice of removal before being served by plaintiffs did not render removal defectiveholding that the plain language of the diversity jurisdiction statute permitted a workmens compensation claim to be filed as an original action in federal court even though congress clearly intended to prohibit the removal of such claims congress used language specifically barring removal of such cases from state to federal courts and at the same time left unchanged the old language which just as specifically permits civil suits to be filed in federal courts in cases where there are both diversity of citizenship and the prescribed jurisdictional amount in this situation we must take the intent of congress with regard to the filing of diversity cases in federal district courts to be that which its language clearly sets forth congress could very easily have used language to bar filing of workmens compensation suits by the insurer as well as removal of such suits and it could easily do so stillholding that notice of removal was defective on its face because it failed to contain a copy of the process as required by the removal statuteholding that any defect in removal procedure must be cured within the 30day removal period or it is fatal to the removal and defendants failure to attach exhibits to the notice of removal within that time required remand & \n\nwitnesses was held to be violative of accepted grand jury practice, therefore requiring dismissal of the indictment. Similarly, in United States v. Bowdach, 324 F.Supp. 123 (S.D.Fla.1971), it was held that the presence of a witness who played audio tapes for the purpose of refreshing the memory of other witnesses constituted a violation of Rule 6(d). It has likewise been held that Rule 6(d) is violated where an attorney for the government testifies before the grand jury and then, having resumed his prosecutorial role, remains in the grand jury room in the presence of other witnesses. See United States v. Gold, 470 F.Supp. 1336, 1351 (N.D.Ill.1979); United States v. Treadway, 445 F.Supp. 959, 962 (N.D.Tex.1978); contra, however, is United States v. Birdman, 602 F.2d 547 (3rd Cir. 1979) (<HOLDING>). The government\u2019s position that the holding that an agreement in which one party promised to make monthly payments to the other partys attorney as part of an asset sale contract was for the direct benefit of the attorneyholding that the attorneys presence is authorized under rule 6d as that of a witness on the one hand and as an attorney for the government on the otherholding that waiver by attorney was binding upon the accused when before the state introduced the evidence complained of on appeal counsel for the state in the presence of the accused and his counsel stated the agreement and the evidence of the witness was then read to the jury in the presence of the accused and his counsel without objectionholding that defendant is under an obligation to give the government notice of an alibi witness even if defendant is unable to locate the witnessholding depends on the policy language at hand & \n\nthey qualified as an excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay. As well, we agree with Haygood that the circuit court erred in distinguishing this case from Crawford on the bases that the statement in Crawford (1) was taken in a custodial interrogation and (2) was not an excited utterance. First, the fact that the statements here were not taken at a police station during custodial interrogation, although a proper factor to consider, is not dispositive. See Davis, 547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (considering the difference in the level of formality between the interview in the station house in Crawford and the frantic 911 call in Davis as one of the factors in determining whether the statements from the 911 call were testimonial); Hammon, 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (<HOLDING>); Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1166-67 (considering the recognizing the crawford interrogation was more formal but determining the interrogation of hammons wife was formal enough in considering that factor and determining the wifes statements were testimonialrecognizing that there are no formal procedures for determining the validity of rs 2477 claimsholding that edwards protection only extends to interrogation and that denial of counsel is only one factor to be considered in determining whether consent was voluntarily given but it is not a decisive factholding that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of an allegedly coerced interrogation where the taped interrogation was played for jurors and the defendant crossexamined the witness at length about the interrogationholding that the sixth amendment generally permits interrogation of a represented person only 1 if it was the defendant and not the government who initiated the interrogation and 2 if the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel & \n\nFor example, interrogation in a police station does not amount to custody per se. See Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977); California v. Beheler, 463 U.S. 1121, 1125, 103 S.Ct. 3517, 77 L.Ed.2d 1275 (1983); Ashe, 125 Md.App. at 551, 726 A.2d 786. As the Supreme Court explained in Mathiason, 429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. 711: Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer Miranda warnings to everyone whom they question. Another established rule is that police do not violate Mira th Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>); State v. Patterson, 146 N.C.App. 113, 552 holding that appellants complaint on appeal that the environment was coercive did not change the fact that he was not in custody when he voluntarily went to the police station was told several times he could leave and did leave after the interrogationholding that accused was not in custody when told he was not under arrest and was free to leave and did in fact freely leave the interviewholding that a defendant who was told several times he was not under arrest and who never asked to leave during an interview with investigators was not in custodyholding that the defendant was placed in official detention when two police officers approached him and told him that he was under arrest as the defendant could not reasonably have believed that he was free to leaveholding in the context of a prosecution for second degree escape that although defendant was not handcuffed he had nonetheless been placed under arrest had had his liberty restrained in that he was not free to leave and at that point the first step in the process of transporting him to the police station had begun consequently the defendants arrest was complete and he was in custody & \n\nindicia of fraud to create inquiry notice as a matter of law in Betz, UL was engaged in endorsing products for reasonably safe consumer use, and its listing of the Cadet heaters as safe, in combination with the 1999 recall, was sufficient to give Platt notice that UL\u2019s prior assurances of the heaters\u2019 safety were potentially false. It is irrelevant what else Platt might have learned through further diligent investigation after 1999 about UL\u2019s misrepresentations or intent to deceive Platt and others regarding the Cadet heaters\u2019 safety, because in 1999 Platt already knew that UL\u2019s prior representations about the heaters\u2019 safety were false, and that knowledge was sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations for fraud under California law. See Hamilton Materials, 494 F.3d at 1206-07 (<HOLDING>) (citation omitted). These cases demonstrate holding that a defendant is not entitled to relief from default judgment because notice to an attorney of filing of motions and orders is constructive notice to the client even when the client did not have actual noticeholding that the cause of action accrued on the date of saleholding in a civil rico case based upon predicate acts of mail and wire fraud that the plaintiff must plead a material misrepresentation of fact that was calculated or intended to deceive persons of reasonable prudence and comprehension and that the plaintiff relied upon that material misrepresentation to establish the fraud statutes requisite scheme to defraudholding that a plaintiff need not have notice of the defendants specific intention to deceive before the fraud action accrued all that is relevant is that a reasonable person would have been on notice of a potential misrepresentationholding that notice to supervisor is notice to city & \n\nrights of action that have not been clearly legislated because of its regard for the state legislature as a \u201crepository of sovereign powers, whose dispensation must in any context be strictly construed.\u201d A & E Supply Co. v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 798 F.2d 669, 674 (4th Cir. 1986) (citing Commonwealth v.

These principles have been used to foreclose litigants from pursuing private rights of action in a number of contexts including (i) teacher contract renewals, Giannoutsos, 238 Va. at 147 (<HOLDING>); (ii) materialmen and workmen seeking damages holding the only remedy available to the teacher fired without notice was entitlement to a contract for the ensuing year as provided in the codeholding that one year warranty was not an exclusive remedy for defective construction where the contract did not so stateholding that for a suit to be brought in the venue in which the contract was to be performed the contract must expressly state where the performance of the contract was to occurholding that a notice of deficiency was invalid where it was the second notice mailed for that year and the taxpayer timely petitioned the court as to the first noticeholding that a thwarted remedy is not available & \n\nthe jury.\u201d). This is particularly true where the arrest occurred on January 31, 2007, over four years prior to the incident which gave rise to this action. Accordingly, evidence of Goodman\u2019s prior arrest to establish that she in fact engaged in acts of prostitution is excluded. In addition to using this evidence to establish truthfulness of any alleged defamatory statements, Defendants also seek its admission on the question of defamation damages. Although Goodman\u2019s, San Diego arrest may be minimally relevant to her reputation at the time she was detained at the Cosmopolitan, reputational damage is presumed in a slander per se action like this one, as explained below in the Court\u2019s discussion of Goodman\u2019s defamation claim. See Branda v. Sanford, 97 Nev. 643, 637 P.2d 1223, 1225 (1981) (<HOLDING>). This is because \u201c[a]t the heart of the libel- recognizing distinction between actual and per se conflicts of interestholding that under south carolina law slander is actionable per se where plaintiff is alleged to have committed adulteryholding that statements that insinuated that plaintiff was an adulteress were actionable as slander per se under missouri lawrecognizing that slander per se is actionable without a showing of actual or special damagesrecognizing continued vitality of kassowitz on what is slander per se & \n\nattempt to avoid the effect of a judgment offered as a link in the chain of title in a suit to try the title to property. See In re A.L.H.C., 49 S.W.3d 911, 917 (Tex.App.Dallas 2001, pet. denied). SOS Alliance argues that its attempt to set aside the 2004 judgment can be considered a collateral attack on the judgment. We disagree. This proceeding was instituted for the sole purpose of declaring the 2004 judgment void, and in the same district court in which exas Supreme Court\u2019s holding with respect to what constitutes a collateral attack. See Browning, 165 S.W.3d at 345-46 (defining collateral attack as made in \u201ca proceeding not instituted for the purpose of correcting, modifying, or vacating the judgment\u201d); see also Middleton v.

In the 30-page M&R adopted by the district court, the magistrate judge correctly began the predominance and superiority analysis by laying out the elements of Appellants\u2019 claims and what must be shown to prove antitrust liability in a class action context. The magistrate judge continued his Rule 23(b)(3) analysis by finding that Appellants failed to present class-wide proof of the various elements of their private antitrust claims. Ultimately, the magistrate judge concluded that individualized issues affecting each of the roughly one million c., 381 F.3d 717, 737 (7th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). Because Appellants brought this case as a holding that the relevant geographic market or appropriate section of the country is the area in which the acquired firm is an actual competitorholding that a contract for an exclusive agency to market a product contains an implied promise to use all reasonable efforts to market the productholding that economic analysis in antitrust context is virtually meaningless if it is entirely unmoored from at least a rough definition of a product and geographic marketholding that changes in the baseball card market between 1965 and 1980 foreclosed any argument that a definition of the relevant market by the federal trade commission could preclude relitigation of the market definition issueholding district court erred by incorporating issue of anticompetitive market effect into its standing analysis confusing antitrust injury with an element of a claim under section 1 of the sherman act and stating district courts approach may have been result of the similar antitrust injury label applied to injury component of antitrust standing analysis and to marketplace harm element under section 1 & \n\nF.2d at 206-07. Reasonableness, as shown by the movant, is essentially judged by looking to \u201cthe delay ... from the time the party is deemed to have notice of the grounds for its Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Jones v. City of Richmond, 106 F.R.D. 485, 489 (E.D.Va.1985). In measuring this delay, however, there is no set time period distinguishing timely from untimely motions outside of the absolute, one-year time frame for Rule 60(b)(l)-(3) motions. What constitutes a reasonable time will generally depend on the facts of each case. See United States v. Wyle (In re Pacific Far East Lines, Inc.), 889 F.2d 242, 249 (9th Cir.1989). A major consideration may well be whether the nonmovant was prejudiced by the delay and whether the movant had a good reason for failing to take action sooner. Compare id. (<HOLDING>), with McLawhorn v. John W. Daniel & Co., 924 holding an internal error that caused the movant to receive the trustees notice of motion twentysix days after the court heard the trustees motion may have constituted excusable neglect had the movant made a prompt motion for reconsideration and pointing out it is the movants actions after he became aware of the existence of the trustees motion that reaches the level of willfulnessholding that the csu board of trustees and individual trustees sued in their official capacity are a political arm of the state and as such are immune from suitholding that a debtor could not relitigate the claim that the trustee breached his fiduciary duty because the bankruptcy court had already held that the trustees actions were not improperholding a bankruptcy trustees rule 60b6 motion timely despite a delay of eighteen months from the date of the court order and fifteen months from the denial of the trustees written request for a refund government found to have been put on notice of intention to reopen settlement by earlier actions of trusteeholding that the trustees preference actions against each of the defendants was precluded as a matter of law by the debtors earlier assumption of its agreements with them & \n\nHe did not provide all of the documents responsive to the request until August 27, 1993, more than seven months after the demand was made. Moskowitz therefore violated his duty of disclosure under ERISA and his conduct gives rise to liability under \u00a7 1132(c)(1). Because the award of penalties is committed to the sound discretion of the Court, I must determine whether Moskow-itz\u2019s conduct warrants imposition of such a penalty. In determining whether to assess a penalty under \u00a7 1132(c)(1) courts have considered such factors as bad faith or intentional conduct on the part of the administrator, the length of the delay, the number of requests made and documents withheld, and the existence of any prejudice to the participant or beneficiary. See Ziaee v. Vest, 916 F.2d 1204 (7th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied 499 U.S. 959, 111 S.Ct. 1581, holding that in exercise of its discretion district court may consider factors such as number of requests made and number of documents withheldholding that district court may consider documents referred to in plaintiffs complaint and central to his claimrecognizing that district court in exercise of its rule 16b discretion may consider other relevant factors including in particular whether allowing the amendment of the pleading at this stage of the litigation will prejudice defendantsholding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that a district court may depart upward based upon a significant number of fraudulent schemes conducted by the defendant & \n\n"}

While Mr. Khan makes the assertion that he \u201cvigorously assisted authorities,\u201d he does not point to any concrete actions on his part other than bringing the authorities to the apartment in Brooklyn where he received the heroin. See Pet. Mot. at 3. The government acknowledged this act but determined it was not sufficient to warrant a substantial assistance motion. Mr. Khan fails to allege any suspect motive on the part of the government. See United States v. Higgins, 967 F.2d 841, 845 (3d Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>).

We have rejected a defendant\u2019s claim for an additional one-level reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3El.l(b) where there was no government motion filed in support of such a reduction. U.S. v. Wade, 458 F.3d 1273, 1282 (11th Cir.2006), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2096, 167 L.Ed.2d 816 (2007). It appears, however, that we are not precluded from reviewing for an abuse of discretion the government\u2019s refusal to file a motion for a reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3E1.1(b). See Wade v. United States, 504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1844, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

The court concluded that the defendant could still file a petition under \u00a7 2255 if his claim alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or challenged the voluntariness of the guilty plea. Id. In sum, a \u00a7 2255 waiver should not bar ineffective assistance of counsel claims or claims that a guilty plea was involuntary, just as direct appeal waivers do not bar those claims. General enforcement of \u00a7 2255 waivers, subject to the same exceptions as direct appeal waivers, aligns with precedent from other district courts in this Circuit that have indicated a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to file a \u00a7 2255 motion is as valid as a waiver of the right to a direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 113 F.Supp.2d 879, 898 (E.D.Va.1999) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Tayman, 885 F.Supp. 832, 834 holding that a failure to file an appeal is within the scope of the waiver because the failure does not undermine the validity of the plea or waiverholding the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding a defendants waiver of appellate rights in a plea agreementholding that the united states breach of the plea agreement releases the defendant from the appeal waiverholding that a plea agreement with a waiver of direct appeal rights does not include a waiver of collateral remedies because the government could have included a waiver of collateral rights in the plea agreement and chose not to do soholding that a waiver of right to appeal contained in a plea agreement is enforceable & \n\n\u00a7 3553(a)(7) to justify the magistrate\u2019s decision to depart.

The sentencing judge may not depart unless he or she has legal authority under the Guidelines to do so. United States v.

Miller, 991 F.2d 552 (9th Cir.1993), and United States v. Berlier, 948 F.2d 1093 (9th Cir.1991), we analyzed the related question of the scope of \u00a7 3E1.1 departures based on pre-trial restitution Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). Guideline \u00a7 5K2.0 requires that the holding that the district court was not required to state affirmatively on the record that it knew it possessed the authority to depart downwardholding that this court does not review decisions of a district court not to depart downward unless the record reflects that the district court was not aware of or did not understand its discretion to make such a departurerecognizing that a defendant may appeal a district courts refusal to depart downward if the sentence was imposed in violation of law because the district court misconstrued its authority to departholding that district court may not depart downward to preserve defendants ability to make restitutionholding that a circuit court has no jurisdiction to review a district courts discretionary decision not to depart downward from the guidelines but would have jurisdiction if the district court based its decision on the belief that it did not have the authority to depart & \n\ntrial court to hold an evidentiary hearing to make a factual determination as to whether Richardson\u2019s failure to appear at his sentencing was willful. At this hearing, the State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Richardson willfully failed to appear. See Peacock v. State, 77 So.3d 1285, 1288 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citing Ingmire, 9 So.3d at 1281). If the State fails to establish willfulness, then Richardson should be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement previously accepted by the trial court. See Lowery v. State, 22 So.3d 745, 749 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009). REVERSED and REMANDED. TORPY, PALMER and LAMBERT, JJ., concur. 1 . Richardson\u2019s plea agreement is known as a \"Quarterman\u201d agreement. See Quarterman v.

B. Downward Departure in Sentencing Flake contends that the federal district court erroneously concluded during the sentencing proceedings that it did not have the legal authority to depart downward on the basis of the six months that Flake had already been held in custody on related state charges. We find no support for Flake\u2019s contention in the record and hold that the district court was aware of and properly exercised its discretion. See United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, 222 F.3d 1057, 1064-65 (9th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). C. Right of Allocution Flake contends that he holding that we may not review a district courts refusal to grant a downward departure unless the court mistakenly believed that it lacked the authority to grant such a departureholding that the district courts refusal to grant a downward departure was discretionary and not because it believed it lacked the authority to depart where the court assessed the facts of the case and concluded that the departure requested does not seem to have a basisholding that a district courts statement that there was no basis for a downward departure did not indicate that it believed it lacked authorityholding that the district court was not required to state affirmatively on the record that it knew it possessed the authority to depart downwardholding that the district courts denial of a downward departure was an exercise of discretion and therefore not reviewable & \n\ncopies to the United States Sentencing Commission and the United States Bureau of Prisons. 1 . The Tenth Circuit has not directly addressed the question of what constitutes \"a single act of aberrant behavior.\u201d In United States v. Pe\u00f1a, 930 F.2d 1486 (10th Cir.1991), the court upheld the district court\u2019s decision to depart downward on the basis of \"a single act of aberrant behavior.\u201d The Tenth Circuit found that implicit in the district court\u2019s findings was the conclusion that defendant's behavior was an aberration from her usual conduct, as reflected by her long-term employment, economic support for her family, and lack of either abuse or prior involvement in the distribution of controlled substances. Pe\u00f1a, 930 F.2d at 1495. Cf. United States v. Bauer, 995 F.2d 182 (10th Cir.1993) recognizing that a defendant may appeal a district courts refusal to depart downward if the sentence was imposed in violation of law because the district court misconstrued its authority to departholding there was no jurisdiction to review district courts discretionary refusal to depart downward on the grounds that defendants conduct constituted a single act of aberrant behaviorholding that a circuit court has no jurisdiction to review a district courts discretionary decision not to depart downward from the guidelines but would have jurisdiction if the district court based its decision on the belief that it did not have the authority to departrecognizing that aberrant criminal behavior may justify downward varianceholding that district court may not depart downward to preserve defendants ability to make restitution & \n\nof the Government\u2019s bargaining power and the fact that the defendant waives his constitutional rights. Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d at 236. When considering an alleged breach of a plea agreement, we first identify the terms of the agreement. We then determine whether there has been a breach. If so, we fashion a remedy. Id. at 235. In Miller\u2019s case, the Government filed a written 5K1.1 motion, which requested a downward departure of \u201c \u20183 levels from the parties\u2019 stipulated offense level of 26,\u2019 to \u2018offense level 23.\u2019 \u201d Br. for Appellee 27 (quoting App. 360). Miller asserts that he reasonably understood this to be- a term of the plea agreement and, therefore, that the Government was bound to recommend offense level 23 at sentencing. Cf. United States v. Baird, 218 F.3d 221, 230 (3d Cir. 2000) (<HOLDING>). We will assume for the sake of argument that holding federal court is not bound by terms of plea agreement between defendant and state authoritiesholding that the government is no longer bound by its obligations under a plea agreement when a defendant commits a material breachholding that objecting to guidelines calculations as specifically reserved in the plea agreement is not a breach of the plea agreement even if the objection is overruled and thus government is not released from obligation under the agreement to move for acceptance of responsibilityholding that when a court accepts a fixed plea agreement it is bound by the agreements termsholding that the government was bound by an agreement it treated as binding although it preceded the formal plea agreement & \n\nraise a substantial question regarding the appellant\u2019s guilty plea. United States v. Inabinette, 66 M.J. 320, 322 (C.A.A.F.2008). \u201cBy pleading guilty, an accused does more than admit that he [committed] the various acts alleged in a specification; \u201che is admitting guilt of a substantive crime.\u2019\u201d United States v. Campbell, 68 M.J. 217, 219 (C.A.A.F.2009) (quoting United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 570, 109 S.Ct. 757, 102 L.Ed.2d 927 (1989)). During the plea inquiry, Appellant admitted under oath each of the elements of the offense of indecent exposure, including that he exposed himself to public view. When an accused pleads guilty, there is no requirement that the government establish the factual predicate for the plea. United States v. Faircloth, 45 M.J. 172, 174 (C.A.A.F.1996) (<HOLDING>). \u201cThe factual predicate is sufficiently holding that in a guilty plea ease the court would not speculate as to the true victim of larceny with respect to copayees on a checkholding that the defendants guilty plea was valid where the district court carefully questioned the defendant about whether he understood the consequences of his guilty pleaholding that the defendant remains the master of his case particularly with respect to the entry of a guilty pleaholding entry of guilty plea waives challenges to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea emphasis addedholding that a defendants guilty plea was unconditional where the guilty plea was not in writing and the government did not consent to it being conditional & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); see also State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 430, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, this Court has held that [\u0430] holding that juveniles request for parent is invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that a suspects invocation of the right to remain silent must be unequivocal to require that police questioning ceaserecognizing two aspects to assertion of fifth amendment rights 1 a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand request was made for an attorney and 2 the request was for assistance with a custodial interrogation not for subsequent hearings or proceedingsholding a juveniles request to speak to a probation officer is not a per se invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that an unequivocal invocation of the fifth amendment right to counsel must be presented in a manner that a reasonable police officer under similar circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for the presence of an attorney & \n\nunder the ADA. The District Court denied his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. In September 2011, the District Court granted summary judgment for Cryovac on Spring\u2019s FMLA claims. Spring filed a timely notice of appeal. II. A. State-Law Claims Spring argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his state-law claim for retaliatory discharge. We review the District Court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo. Marcavage v. Nat'l Park Serv., 666 F.3d 856, 858 (3d Cir.2012). Spring contends that under Pennsylvania law, which recognizes an exception to the at-will employment doctrine for a termination based on filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim, he also has a claim for retaliatory discharge. See Shick v. Shirey, 552 Pa. 590, 716 A.2d 1231, 1232 (1998) (<HOLDING>). The Pennsylvania courts have yet to enumerate holding that employee must prove that the sole reason for their discharge was their filing of a workers compensation claim to prevail on a claim of wrongful discharge under marylands workers compensation actholding that because maryland law expressly creates right to file workers compensation claim action exists for wrongful discharge for termination based solely on the filing of a workers compensation claimrecognizing a tort action when employee was dismissed for filing a workers compensation claimholding that an atwill employee who alleges retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers compensation claim has stated a cause of action under pennsylvania lawrecognizing retaliatory discharge tort implied by the workers compensation act & \n\nfactors, the Burnet court relied on Snedigar, which had in turn relied on Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. 223. The Snedigar court\u2019s holding (with the Burnet court\u2019s deletions italicized) is as follows: We . . . hold that when a trial judge chooses one of the harsher remedies allowable under CR 37(b), the reasons for that choice should he clearly stated on the record. We further hold that when the most severe sanction of default or dismissal is ordered, it must be apparent from the record that the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed, and whether it found the Associated Mortgage due process factors [of willfulness and substantial prejudice] to be present. 53 Wn. App. at 487 (emphasis added); Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. at 228-29 (<HOLDING>). The Burnet court also cited a line of cases holding that a trial court had the authority to impose a default judgment as a sanction for violating a rule 16 scheduling order pursuant to rule 37b2 stating we agree with the basic premise that a default sanction can under certain circumstances be an appropriate response to a violation of a rule 16 order after all the express terms of rule 37 permit a trial court to impose sanctions when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discoveryholding that district courts order granting motion for default judgment was erroneous because a default judgment cannot be entered until the amount of damages has been ascertained holding that a postjudgment contempt sanction for refusal to obey orders whether it is characterized as a civil or a criminal sanction is immediately appealable as a final order under 1291recognizing that courts have discretion to exclude evidence as a sanction for violation of a discovery orderholding that the sanction of a default judgment authorized by cr 37b2c is a harsh remedy which should only be granted where there has been a willful or deliberate refusal to obey a discovery order which refusal substantially prejudices the opponents ability to prepare for trial & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\nfailed to pay Wall\u2019s commissions or did so in bad faith in order to receive treble damages. We disagree and find that the trial court\u2019s interpretation was not an abuse of discretion. South Carolina case law does not support Fruehaufs position. Fruehauf cites to a number of cases which discuss puni tive damages in general, but not treble damages under \u00a7 41-10-80(0). See, e.g., Carter v. R.C. Jordan Oil Co., 301 S.C. 84, 390 S.E.2d 367, 368 (S.C.Ct.App.1990). Although South Carolina law requires that there be no good faith dispute concerning the wages due in order for treble damages to be awarded under \u00a7 41-10-80(0, the decision is in the complete discretion of the trial court and no specific finding of bad faith or willfulness is required. Rice, 318 S.C. 95, 456 S.E.2d 381 (S.C.1995) (<HOLDING>); Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, holding that the tcpas treble damages provision is remedialholding that when a trial court determines that the amount of damages awarded by a jury is excessive the court may either suggest remittitur or grant a new trial on the issue of damagesholding that threequarter guarantee payments were not wages under arizona wage payment laws permitting treble damages for nonpayment under rationale that wages are restricted to compensation due an employee in return for work performedholding that the treble damages provision is not mandatory and will not apply if the trial court determines that a good faith dispute over the wages allegedly due existsholding that the award of treble damages while a matter of discretion for the trial court is inappropriate in circumstances where there is a bona fide wage dispute & \n\n(2) and (3) of 9006(b) set forth certain exceptions. Paragraph 2 enumerates the bankruptcy rules for which enlargement is not permitted and paragraph 3, which includes Rule 4007(c), enumerates the bankruptcy rules for which enlargement of time is limited to the \u201cextent and under the conditions stated in those rules.\u201d Fed. R.Bankr.P. 9006(b)(3). Although Rule 4007(c) permits a court to extend the time to file a complaint under \u00a7 523(c), the motion to extend must be filed before the time has expired. Accordingly, the Court does not have the discretion to allow an untimely complaint under any of the sections set forth in \u00a7 523(c) on the basis of excusable neglect. See In re Tucker, 263 B.R. 632, 636-637 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2001). See also Byrd v. Alton, 837 F.2d 457, 459 (11th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>). Courts may nonetheless permit a late filed holding that a motion to continue a hearing on a postjudgment motion was ineffective to extend the period for the trial court to rule on the motion absent the express consent of the partiesholding creditors actual notice of chapter 7 case in ample time to prepare and timely file the necessary request for determination of dischargeability bars them from challenging the dischargeability of their claim 15 months after bar dateholding that the district court cannot extend the time for filing a rule 59e motion by margin orderholding that motion to extend time period for filing dischargeability complaint must be made before the running of that period and that court lacks discretion to grant late filed motion to extend time to file dischargeability complaintholding that a second motion to reconsider served within ten days of the denial of the first motion does not extend the time period for filing a notice of appeal from the underlying judgment & \n\nStates v. Bowman, 634 F.3d 357, 360 (6th Cir.2011) (published opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cBut because plea agreements\u2019 constitutional and supervisory implications raise concerns over and above those present in the traditional contract context, in interpreting such agreements we hold the government to a greater degree of responsibility than the defendant ... for imprecisions or ambiguities in the plea agreements.\u201d Id.

As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed.

Carson Harbor objects that the Partnership Defendants' motion is based on new arguments that were not raised in their initial motion for summary judgment in 1997. It asserts the court should refuse to consider these arguments because they should have been raised in the initial motion. The Partnership Defendants\u2019 position has changed materially because of the prior proceedings in this case. All but one of the claims against these defendants has now been dismissed. Accordingly, the court finds that it is appropriate to consider any new arguments raised in the motion. See F.D.I.C. v. Kooyomjian, 220 F.3d 10, 16 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). 279 .

Husband sought that guidance, and Judge Cate provided it. The pricing scheme Judge Cate established did not conflict with the minimum listing price of $225,300 set by the divorce decree and complied with the goals set out in the parties\u2019 subsequent agreement. In light of Wife\u2019s failed attempt to sell the home for $274,000, a lower initial listing price with small periodic reductions is a reasonable approach to severing this remaining tie between Husband and Wife. Accordingly, the family court did not err. To the extent Wife requests \u201creimbursement for maintaining the marital property,\u201d this issue is unpreserved because she failed to raise it to the family court. See Chastain, 381 S.C. at 306, 672 S.E.2d at 114 (<HOLDING>). IV. Remaining Issues Wife further argues the holding an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate reviewholding that an issue was not preserved for appellate review because appellants trial objection does not comport with the issue he raised on appealholding an issue not raised to the family court is not preserved for appellate reviewholding that an appellate court cannot consider an issue that was not preserved for appellate reviewholding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate review & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa. R.A.P. 302(a), \u201c[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d See also Commonwealth v.

Because appellant did not preserve the issue holding that the failure to object to a trial courts instruction constitutes waiverholding that plaintiffs failure to object to the improper comments of defendant during closing arguments resulted in waiver of plaintiffs right to argue the issue on appeal because the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issueholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that failure to object to trial courts refusal of further instruction to jury during deliberation results in waiver of issue on appealholding failure to object in timely fashion at trial results in waiver of issue for appeal & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v.

On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\ngiven multiple opportunities to do so. 2 . In Bonner v. City of Prichard, 661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), this Court adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the former Fifth Circuit handed down prior to close of business on September 30, 1981. 3 . Sanders does not assert the Government was in contact with the victim at some point prior to the day before the start of the trial, nor does Sanders allege the Government in any way delayed informing him regarding its meeting with the victim, during which the victim was shown the photographic lineup. Moreover, we need not consider Sanders' claim the photographic lineup was \"unduly suggestive,\u201d as he raises this argument for the first time in his reply brief. See United States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). 4 . Contrary to Sanders' contention, the holding argument not raised in opening brief but raised for the first time in reply brief was waivedholding that a partys failure to raise an issue in the opening brief waived the issue even though the party raised the issue in his reply briefholding argument is waived when raised for first time in reply briefholding an appellant who raised an issue for the first time in his reply brief waived the claimholding that a contention raised for the first time in a reply brief was waived & \n\nCURIAM. Brett C. Kimberlin appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion filed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), in which he sought reconsideration of the court\u2019s order denying relief on his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (1994) petition. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. Kimberlin v. Dewalt, No. CA-99-979-2 (E.D.Va. Oct. 20, 2000). In addition, we decline to consider the claims Kimberlin raises for the first time on appeal. See Muth v. United States, 1 F.3d 246, 250 (4th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). We dispense with oral argument because the holding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be consideredholding that issues raised for first time on appeal generally will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding claims raised for first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstancesholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal are generally waived absent exceptional circumstancesrecognizing that issues raised for first time on appeal generally are not considered absent exceptional circumstances & \n\nfor access services they admitted to ordering and receiving. Plaintiffs now argue that the court erred in finding that \u201cnone of defendants subscribed to plaintiffs\u2019 switched access services by submitting an Access Order as prescribed in the tariffs\u201d and in failing to consider issues of material fact that may establish that TNCI, Global Crossing, and Sprint are liable under the constructive ordering doctrine. The court will consider plaintiffs\u2019 second contention first. STANDARD The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not mention motions to reconsider. The Eighth Circuit has instructed courts to consider such motions either under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b). Sanders v. Clemco Indus., 862 F.2d 161, 168 (8th Cir.1988); see also Schoffstall v.

In addition to his claim above regarding unsworn and allegedly false testimony, Martin argues that the trial court erred by permitting victim impact testimony that was improper in other ways. Because Martin failed to both raise objections and obtain rulings on them regarding any of the allegedly objectionable statements, he has forfeited his right to appeal under ordinary appellate review standards. See Smith, 287 Ga. at 30 (3) (<HOLDING>).

The trial court conducted a hearing, at which Walker could have pursued this legal theory, objected to the State\u2019s alleged lack of evidence of probable cause to arrest, presented evidence to support his allegation, and argued that the lack of evidence required that his statement be suppressed. Walker, however, remained silent; he did not pursue this issue in the trial court; and he did not allow the trial court the opportunity to prevent the alleged injustice. See Adams v. State, 585 So.2d 161, 164 (Ala.l991)(\u201cMatters not objected to at trial cannot be considered for the first time on appeal, since review on appeal applies only to rulings by the trial court.\u201d)- Cf.

Moreover, he had the benefit of two attorneys\u2019 thoughts concerning the post-conviction petitions. We note parenthetically that the attorney who initially drafted one of the petitions, and reviewed the record in Stewart II, did not choose to raise any claim regarding Mr. Pumilia\u2019s alleged incompetency. More significantly, defendant did not even raise this issue in his briefs filed with this court appealing the denial of his post-conviction petitions. Our Supreme Court Rule 341(e)(7) provides that points not asserted in an appellant\u2019s brief are waived and shall not be raised for the first time, as defendant did here, during oral argument. 107 Ill. 2d R. 341(e)(7); see also People v.

Compare State v.

While the Fourth Amendment normally requires little more notice than a knock on the door prior to a forced entry, see Wilson v. Arkansas, \u2014 U.S. -, -, 115 S.Ct. 1914, 1916, 131 L.Ed.2d 976 (1995) (<HOLDING>), the process required by the Fourth Amendment recognizing principleholding that the common law knockandannounce principle forms a part of the fourth amendment reasonableness inquiryholding that commonlaw knock and announce rule is part of the fourth amendment reasonableness inquiryholding that knockandannounce principle is an element of the fourth amendment reasonableness inquiry because we have little doubt that the framers of the fourth amendment thought that the method of an officers entry into a dwelling was among the factors to be considered in assessing the reasonableness of a search and seizureholding that commonlaw knock and announce principle forms a part of the reasonableness inquiry under the fourth amendment & \n\nassociation with, supervision of, delegation of authority to, support for, training of, or participation in a private group practice with, a member or members of a particular class of health care practitioner or professional, or (E) any other matter that does not relate to the competence or professional conduct of a physician. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9). 18 .

Our holding is also consistent with cases in which we set forth a plaintiff's burden when faced with a defense motion for summary judgment under other totality of the circumstances tests. See, e.g., Jones v. Mid-Atlantic Funding Co., 362 Md. 661, 681, 766 A.2d 617, 628 (2001) (<HOLDING>); see also Magee v. DanSources Tech.

Second, Chambers argues that the police exceeded their authority under the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8953, thereby invalidating the search warrant, because the shooting occurred in Harrisburg, was investigated by Harrisburg police, and Harrisburg police obtained the search warrant, but the warrant was approved by a Swatara magistrate and executed in Swatara Township. Even if Chambers\u2019s interpretation of the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act were correct, however, he does not explain how a violation of state law would be relevant to the federal constitutional analysis required here. Cf Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 176-78, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008) (<HOLDING>). Finally, Chambers\u2019s argument that the holding that warrantless arrest based on probable cause did not violate the fourth amendmentholding that a warrantless arrest on probable cause does not violate the fourth amendment even if state law required the police to have prior authorizationholding that a search incident to a lawful arrest does not violate the fourth amendmentholding that arrest in backyard violated fourth amendmentholding that state law is immaterial for fourth amendment search analysis and refusing to suppress evidence obtained illegally under state law after warrantless arrest because the arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone and as we have just concluded it is not the province of the fourth amendment to enforce state law that amendment does not require the exclusion of evidence obtained from a constitutionally permissible arrest & \n\napartment # 3 constituted an illegal search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and the fruit of that search, which was the information that Jackson\u2019s key fit the lock, was used to obtain the search warrant for apartment # 3. Thus, Taylor argues that the corrected search warrant for apartment # 3 was tainted and invalid because it was fruit of the poisonous tree. The Eighth Circuit has not decided whether trying a key in a lock constitutes a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Dickson, 58 F.3d 1258, 1264 (8th Cir.), superseded on other grounds, 64 F.3d 409 (8th Cir.1995), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 747, 133 L.Ed.2d 695 (1996). The federal courts of appeals are split on this issue. See, e.g., United States v. Concepcion, 942 F.2d 1170, 1172 (7th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Lyons, 898 F.2d 210, 212-13 holding that in a 1983 action issue of probable cause is for the juryholding that although the owner of a lock has enough privacy interest in a keyhole to make the inspection of that lock a search the privacyinterest is so small that no probable cause is needed to inspect itholding that a defendant has no constitutional right to challenge the search or seizure of property belonging to a third party even if the search was without probable causeholding that the subjective intent of the officer is no longer determinative wjhen applying the objective test generally the only determination to be made is whether probable cause existed for the stop in question and that per whren a violation of traffic law provided sufficient probable cause to make the subsequent search and seizure reasonablerecognizing that a greater expectation of privacy exists in property that is carried on ones person so that probable cause is required & \n\nSupreme Court concluded in Bell that strip searches were not per se unreasonable and could be performed in conformity with the Fourth Amendment on less than probable cause in some instances. See Bell, 441 U.S. at 559-560, 99 S.Ct. at 1884-85. In order to determine the reasonableness of the search and the instances requiring less than probable cause, the Supreme Court set out the following test: The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), aff'g, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979) (<HOLDING>). Courts considering the strip search issue holding that mandatory visual strip search policy in county jail was unconstitutionalholding that arrestees for minor offenses may be subjected to a strip search only if jail officials have probable cause to believe that arrestees are concealing weapons or contrabandholding unconstitutional blanket jail policy of subjecting all arrestees to strip and visual body cavity searchesholding that police may search containers whether open or closed located within arrestees reachholding that mandatory routine visual strip search policy for all arrestees who were to be introduced into general jail population was constitutional & \n\nsituation.\u201d Id. at 396-97. Nevertheless, the applicable standard is an objective one: \u201c[T]he question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d Id. at 397. In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him. This search revealed that Wilke degree of force is necessary, gratuitous acts against a person who has been seized might violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. Phelps v. Coy, 286 F.3d 295, 297, 301-02 (6th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Santos, 287 F.3d at 853 (explaining that holding that suspect was not in custody when officer handcuffed him for officer safety while transporting him to police stationholding that defendant was arrested when the police officer took physical custody of him by grabbing his arm and returned him to the hotel for detention thererecognizing the necessity of analyzing officer coys use of force against phelps in segments where coy arrested phelps placed him in handcuffs took him to the police station for booking and then beat him after he raised his leg in a manner that coy perceived to be a threat to another police officerholding the defendant was not under arrest when police asked him to go to the station and then offered him a ride because he did not have transportationholding that police executed an illegal arrest when they took a teenage suspect from his home and brought him in handcuffs to the police station for questioning & \n\nobserved that, \u201c[a]t the time of al-Kidd\u2019s arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant unconstitutional.\u201d Id.

Mink, 322 F.3d 1101, 1120 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). In Hydrick, for example, we held that court holding that pretrial detainees can bring substantive due process claimholding in light of the supreme courts observation that the due process rights of pretrial detainees are at least as great as the eighth amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner that the eighth amendment provides a minimum standard of care for determining the rights of pretrial detainees quoting revere 463 us at 244 103 sct 2979holding that pretrial detainees have at least the same protections under the fourteenth amendment as posttrial detainees have under the eighth amendmentholding that pretrial detainees possess a constitutional right against deliberate indifference to their serious medical needs because the due process rights of a pretrial detainee are at least as great as the eighth amendment protections available to a convicted prisonerholding that because pretrial detainees fourteenth amendment rights are comparable to prisoners eighth amendment rights the same standards apply & \n\nwe find that a more intensive analysis is necessary when searches of this nature are conducted, especially when done in the field. That is not to say, however, that these searches are per se prohibited \u2014 no court in this Commonwealth has ever made such a declaration, and we decline to do so today. But we do note that officers should be cautious when performing these types of searches, outside of a sanitary and secure police station. And while this case provides facts sufficient to support the reasonableness of the search conducted, that will not always be the case. Indeed, the police risk the loss of evidence when they subject arrestees to strip searches outside of the police station, and even sometimes when the search is conducted in the station house. See Stewart, 767 F.2d at 156-57 (<HOLDING>). Here, as stated above, the officers faced a holding strip searches conducted in the station house without reasonable suspicion that minor offenders had possession of contraband are unreasonable and violate the fourth amendmentholding that policy requiring strip searches of prisoners prior to transfer did not violate fourth amendmentholding searches conducted without a warrant based on probable cause are presumptively unreasonableholding that inmates fourth amendment protection from unreasonable strip searches survives hudsonholding that it was clearly established that a strip search policy applied to minor offense detainees without particularized reasonable suspicion was unlawful & \n\nto move for the exclusion of time, it argues that this failure did not contribute to the delay. Instead, the government contends that Koerber caused the delay in January 2011 by requesting (and receiving) an indefinite pretrial-motion-cutoff date. In evaluating the government\u2019s position, we note that we later address how Koerber\u2019s role in the trial delays might affect the STA analysis. But first we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in considering this 42-day period as part of the government\u2019s \u201cpattern of neglect\u201d leading to the STA violation. The January 27, 2011 continuance for pretrial motions did not trigger an excludable delay in the STA clock. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(h)(1); Bloate v. United States, 559 U.S. 196, 204, 130 S.Ct. 1345, 176 L.Ed.2d 54 (2010) (<HOLDING>). In addition, \u201cdefense responsibility for holding an excludable period under 2912074a commences on the day immediately after the filing of a defendants pretrial motionholding that motion challenging pretrial detention was excludable under actholding that time granted for preparing pretrial motions is not automatically excludable under 3161h1 but is excludable only after the district court enters appropriate findings under 3161h7aholding that time excluded from a speedy trial clock for pretrial motion preparation is not automatically excluded under 3161h1 but may only be excluded when a court makes appropriate reasonableness findings under 3161h7holding that the time granted to prepare pretrial motions is not automatically excludable under 3161h1 but may be excluded only when a court grants a continuance based on appropriate findings under 3161h7 & \n\nfor determining whether a war-rantless search of a probationer is reasonable is whether the police or probation officer has a well-founded suspicion that a probation violation has occurred. The determination of whether a probationer\u2019s right to privacy has been violated is dependent, then, on the nature of the search conducted and is not dependent on the nature of the proceeding in which the fruits of the search are to be admitted. Id. at 1095 (emphasis original, internal footnotes and citations omitted). Appellant also cites Mason v. State, 838 S.W.2d 657, 659 (Tex. Ct.

Dodd, 419 So.2d 333 (Fla. 1982) (<HOLDING>). The Commonwealth, in its brief, cites a holding that probation revocation proceedings are clearly not criminal proceedingsholding that the exclusionary rule embodied in the search and seizure provision of the state constitution applies in probation revocation proceedingsholding that probation and parole revocation hearings are not criminal proceedings such that the state exclusionary rule applies but noting that police misconduct which shocks the conscience may lead to invocation of the exclusionary ruleholding that exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture proceedingsholding that the exclusionary rule under the fourth amendment applies to civil forfeiture proceedings & \n\nfor searches under the Maine Constitution than is provided under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

In State v.

According to the Court, Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury.

The pre-sentence report stated that the mandatory minimum terms for these convictions were ten and five years, respectively. The Government objected, arguing that Count 10 constituted a second conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and therefore the mandatory minimum for Count 10 should be 25 years. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) (\u201cIn the case of a second or subsequent conviction under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924], the person shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.... \u201d); Deal v.

I. DISCUSSION A Unconstitutionality of 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 922(g) Seneeharles first contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, both facially and as-applied to him, because his possession of the firearm did not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Because Seneeharles did not object to the constitutionality of the felon-in-possession statute in the district court, we review for plain error. See United States v. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating we review constitutional objections \u201cnot raised before the district court only for plain error\u201d). Senecharles\u2019s facial challenge is directly foreclosed by our precedent upholding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). See United States v. Scott, 263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir. 2001) (<HOLDING>). Further, because the parties stipulated the holding that double jeopardy precludes dual convictions for felon in possession of a firearm and felon in possession of separate ammunition because section 790231 florida statutes prohibits possession of any firearm ammunition or electric weapon or device emphasis in originalholding the jurisdictional element of the statute ie the requirement that the felon possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition immunizes 922g1 from a facial constitutional attackholding that conviction for possession of ammunition by a convicted felon in violation of 18 usc 922g is valid under the commerce clause as long as the ammunition had previously moved in interstate commerce even though the possession did not have a substantial affect on sameholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that dual convictions of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon violated double jeopardy & \n\nhome, appellant possessed the rifles and exhibited them to Quinley. Quinley\u2019s testimony was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that appellant exclusively possessed the stolen rifles recently after they were stolen. Appellant\u2019s reliance on Smith v. Commonwealth, 247 Va. 157, 439 S.E.2d 409 (1994), is misplaced. Smith involved the application of the exclusive possession inference to the Commonwealth\u2019s charge of grand larceny of a truck based solely upon the defendant\u2019s possession of a checkbook and knives which the owner of the truck had left in the truck but had not seen for months prior to the theft. In Smith, the evidence failed to prove that the truck, checkbook, and knives were stolen at the same time. Cf. Williams v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 583, 597, 50 S.E.2d 407, 414 (1948) (<HOLDING>). Consequently, the Court found that the holding that a defendant may be convicted of theft twice on the basis of intentional possession at one time of stolen property if the property forming the basis of the one conviction was stolen at different times and places from different owners than the property forming the basis of the second convictionholding that the officers examination revealed that there was probable cause to believe that the property was stolenholding proof of possession of stolen goods is sufficient evidence to sustain conviction for theftholding that exclusive possession of recently stolen goods warrants the inference that he stole all of the property for which the defendant is accused of taking provided all the property was stolen at the same time emphasis addedrecognizing that defendants intent to return stolen items to their rightful owner is a valid defense to charge of receiving stolen property & \n\nmake a deal for her client, not that there was a fully integrated cooperation agreement on the table for acceptance. This is best illustrated by the paucity of detail regarding the terms of the \u201cagreement\u201d Bicknese allegedly reached with Meyer. Bicknese and Meyer never discussed such critical details as what level of cooperation would be required of Kozak in order for her to satisfy the purported cooperation agreement nor who would determine whether Kozak had fulfilled her part of the cooperation agreement. Under the circumstances, therefore, the court concludes that no meeting of the minds can be found to have existed between Meyer and Bicknese for a cooperation agreement for Kozak.

State, 527 So.2d 1380 (Fla.1988) holding defendant cannot waive claims of an illegal sentence a sentence violating terms of plea agreement an unknowing and involuntary plea and ineffective assistance of counselholding that as a matter of common sense a defendant is already under a legal duty not to go out and commit more crimes in the future regardless of whether the penalty is ordinary or enhanced neither the court nor counsel is required to advise a defendant what penalty he can expect to receive for crimes not yet committed the defendant can avoid further sentencing consequences enhanced or otherwise by refraining from committing new crimes future sentence enhancement for a later crime is not a direct consequence of a plea at all but is instead contingent first on the defendants voluntary decision to commit another crime second on whether the new crime is one capable of having enhanced sentencing and third on the prosecutors discretionary decision whether to seek enhancement future sentence enhancement is plainly a collateral consequence not a direct consequence of the defendants plea in the earlier caseholding specific performance of plea agreement proper remedy where defendant testified against all of his coconspirators and where court later unilaterally breached original plea agreement by imposing a ninety day term of incarceration in addition to sentence of probation that had been earlier agreed to without first providing1 defendant with opportunity to withdraw plea on the recordholding that the district court erred when it used rule 36 to amend the defendants sentence to include an order of forfeiture that had been agreed to in the plea agreement but which the court failed to make a part of its judgment at sentencingholding that where a furlough and an enhanced sentence for failure to appear in court at a later time are part of the plea agreement a court is justified in imposing the enhanced sentence after the defendant fails to appear in court without giving him an opportunity to withdrawhis plea & \n\nBlankenship admits that these prior convictions fall within the class of felonies to which the statute refers, but he contends that they were too remote in time to serve as a proper predicate for enhancement of the sentence. If a statute that imposes a criminal penalty is ambiguous, it must be construed in favor of the defendant. See Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980). However, in this case, section 924(e)(1) is not ambiguous. There is no indication, either in the statute or in the legislative history, that Congress intended to include a temporal restriction in that statute. See United States v. Green, 904 F.2d 654, 655-56 (11th Cir.1990); see also Young v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 690 F.Supp. 990, 995 (S.D.Ala.1988) (<HOLDING>). We refuse to construct such a restriction out holding the use of a 1951 felony conviction as a predicate for a violation of 18 usc 922g1 did not violate the ex post facto clause because the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm was not committed until after the effective date of the statute under which he was convictedholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that countholding that period of proscription for firearm ownership under section 922g1 was indefiniteholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violation & \n\npredicate to enhance his sentence as a second-offense habitual offender. While defendant objects to this, he offers no statutory or legal analysis to support the contention that his claimed double enhancement is inappropriate. The critical point from Bewersdorf is that the OUIL provisions increased the punishment for each repeated offense, just as the SORA provisions do in the present case. In fact, defendant concedes that there is no error in enhancing a SORA-2 sentence under the habitual-offender provisions as long as the habitual-offender enhancement is based on a felony other than a SORA violation. Thus, to this extent, defendant agrees with our conclusion that MCL 28.729(1) sets forth separate, elevated offenses. 51 E.g., People v Eilola, 179 Mich App 315, 325; 445 NW2d 490 (1989) (<HOLDING>); People v Brown, 186 Mich App 350, 357; 463 holding that the habitualoffender provisions could be used to enhance a sentence for a conviction that constituted firstdegree retail fraud because of a prior conviction mcl 750356c2 as added by 1988 pa 20holding an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid because no prison term was imposed and the conviction may be used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent offenseholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding the death sentence proportional for the firstdegree murder conviction where the aggravators included prior violent felony conviction and hacholding that any fact other than a prior conviction may not be used to enhance a defendants sentence beyond the statutory maximum unless it is submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt & \n\nv. Ebbers, 458 F.3d 110, 128 (2d Cir.2006) ] strongly undermines that position. Moreover, we see no reason why considerations relevant to loss causation in a civil fraud case should not ollow the Second Circuit in expressly applying Dura Pharmaceuticals\u2019s civil principle to criminal securities fraud sentencing. We decline to do so for two reasons. First, we believe that the primary policy rationale of Dura Pharmaceuticals for proscribing overvaluation as a valid measure of loss does not apply in a criminal sanctions context. Second, application of Dura Pharmaceuticals\u2019s civil rule to criminal sentencing would clash with the parallel principles in the Sentencing Guidelines, which have persuasive value in federal courts. See United States v. Staten, 466 F.3d 708, 710 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). As noted, Dura Pha'rmaceuticals rejected the holding that alj committed reversible error in failing to consider whether a claimants failure to seek treatment was due to his financial circumstancesholding that it was reversible error for the trial court to consider cumulative error in assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counselholding that any error by a district court in applying a sentencing enhancement is harmless if it did not change a defendants total offense levelholding that failure to consider guidelines note in applying sentencing enhancement was reversible errorholding that the defendants substantial rights were not affected by a sentencing guidelines enhancement even in the absence of a specific finding by the district court because the evidence amply supported the enhancement & \n\nor while having his features artificially distorted shall, for the first of-fence be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than five years.... Whoever commits any offense described herein while armed with a firearm ... shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than five years. Mass. Gen. L. ch 265 \u00a7 17. As the parties agree, this creates a divisible statute because \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d is not defined in the offense conduct; thus not all armed robberies would constitute firearm offenses. The analysis of a divisible statute in the immigration context is analogous to the application of sentencing enhancements in the sentencing context. In the sentencing context, the court applies Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>); in the immigration context, we apply a holding that a sentencing court in determining whether a burglary was a violent felony that resulted in an enhanced statutory minimum had to rely on charging documents elements of offenses plea colloquies and express findings by the trial judge and could not look to police reports or complaint applicationsholding that in determining whether a prior conviction is a violent felony a court generally must look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offenseholding that a court can look only to the statutory elements charging documents and jury instructions to determine whether an earlier conviction after trial qualified as a violent felony under the accaholding that inquiry under the acca to determine statutory elements of prior conviction is limited to judicial records and may not include documents that simply state facts such as police reportsholding that courts should look to the statutory definition of the crime charged rather than the actual facts of the individuals prior conviction to determine whether the crime qualifies as a violent felony under the acca & \n\nspecify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized.\u201d See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 994(h) (West Supp.1992). The career offender scheme of using a defendant\u2019s criminal record in considering both his offense level and his criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose \u2014 \u201cto prevent repeat offenders from continuing to victimize society.\u201d John, 936 F.2d at 766-67 n. 2. Consequently, Johns\u2019 due process claim lacks merit. Id.; see also United States v. Erves, 880 F.2d 376, 379 (11th Cir.1989) (rejecting both procedural and substantive due process attacks on sentencing guidelines); United States v. Hawkins, 811 F.2d 210, 217 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 833, 108 S.Ct. 110, 98 L.Ed.2d 69 (1987) (<HOLDING>). Defendant\u2019s equal protection claim is equally holding that defendants sixth amendment right to trial by a jury was not violated by district courts reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under the armed career criminal actholding that the armed career criminal designation based on prior convictions does not violate the sixth amendment under bookerholding that a conviction for florida armed robbery is a crime of violence under the armed career criminal actholding sentencing enhancement scheme in armed career criminal amendment to 18 usca 1202a constitutionalholding that application of armed career criminal enhancement falls within exception for prior convictions where facts were undisputed making it unnecessary to engage in further fact finding about a prior conviction & \n\n(emphases added). Thus, contrary to Vester\u2019s contention on appeal, the United States Supreme Court has made a clear distinction between \u201cuncounseled\u201d convictions, and those that were secured with \u201cineffective\u201d counsel. Accordingly, Yester\u2019s claim that his \u201cineffective counsel\u201d amounted to \u201cno counsel,\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and collateral attack on his prior convictions, must fail. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court explicitly held in Custis that the right to collaterally attack a prior criminal conviction in a subsequent proceeding for enhancement purposes is limited to the actual denial of counsel. Id.; see also Daniels v. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 378, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 1581, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001); United States v. Simpson, 94 F.3d 1373, 1381 (10th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). Although the Custis decision concerned the recognizing collateral attack on void orderholding that a judgment as to the title in a prior litigation was not subject to collateral attackholding that where a defendants claim did not amount to a complete denial of counsel it could not form the basis of a collateral attackholding that when the law of the circuit was so firmly against him petitioner did not have to raise an issue to preserve it as a basis for collateral attack later onholding that the complete denial of counsel on direct appeal requires a finding of prejudice & \n\nSee id. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2047-48. A hypothetical illustrates the efficacy of a unitary standard of review. If a district court were to depart upward based upon physical injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2, p.s., we might conclude that it had abused its discretion if the underlying offense were obstruction of justice, because the guideline applicable to that offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(1), provides for an eight-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved caus[es] ... physical injury to a person.\u201d Our review in such a situation would amount to a de novo review of the applicable guideline to determine whether, as a matter of law, it takes physical injury into account. See United States v. Rybicki, 96 F.3d 754, 758 (4th Cir.1996) (noting that when the determinat (4th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 956, 136 holding that downward departure based on defendants restitution was improper because restitution is taken into consideration in assessing whether acceptance of responsibility adjustment should apply and district court abused its discretion in finding defendants restitution was extraordinaryholding apprendi inapplicable to restitution orders because restitution for harm done is a classic civil remedyholding that district court may not depart downward to preserve defendants ability to make restitutionholding no restitution hearing is mandated when defendant did not object to order of restitution or request a hearingholding that equitable restitution is available but that legal restitution is not & \n\nId. at 1413 (internal quotation marks omitted). We held that the district court erred in admitting the evidence because \u201cthe prosecutor made no effort to explain a probative purpose or connection of the earlier conduct in Mississippi to this case\u201d and, further, because \"[s]uch a general assertion as a basis for introducing evidence of prior wrongs or conduct is not sufficient for purposes of Rules 403 or 404(b).\u201d Id. at 1416. This case is readily distinguishable from Sullivan; here, the government explained the purposes for which the evidence was offered (e.g., knowledge and intent) and, as discussed in detail infra, the other-acts evidence offered is clearly relevant to the crimes charged. Cf. United States v. Maass, 153 F.3d 729, 1998 WL 458577, at *2 (10th Cir.1998) (unpublished) (<HOLDING>). 16 . To be sure, the assessment of the recognizing that in sullivan it was obvious that the mississippi cook evidence at issue was not related to the crime chargedholding that agencys construction of statute it was charged with enforcing was entitled to deference because it was reasonable in line with the statutes meaning and related to its expertiseholding it is fundamental error to convict a defendant of crime not charged and which is not a lesser included offense of the charged crimeholding that improper use of a summary chart was harmless because the evidence was merely cumulative and there was overwhelming evidence of the charged crimeholding that a district court may not rely on a charging document without first establishing that the crime charged was the same crime for which the defendant was convicted & \n\nfirst-degree burglary under California Penal Code \u00a7 459 is categorically a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) because the crime inherently involves a substantial risk of physical force: Any time a burglar enters a dwelling with felonious or larcenous intent there is a risk that in the course of committing the crime he will encounter one of its lawful occupants, and use physical force against that occupant either to accomplish his illegal purpose or to escape apprehension. Id. at 571. Although Becker involved a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines, at the time the relevant Guidelines section defined \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16. Becker, 919 F.2d at 569; see also James v. United States, 550 U.S. 192, 208, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Park, 649 F.3d 1175, 1178 holding that we need not remand to the bia so that it may apply the categorical approachholding that the categorical approach applies to 924cholding that the proper inquiry for the categorical approach is whether the conduct covered by the crime presents the requisite risk of injury in the ordinary caseholding that application of the modified categorical approach did not establish a covered conviction where the judgment of conviction did not contain the factual basis for the crimeholding that the categorical approach applies to the identical definition of crime of violence in 18 usc 16 & \n\nAlan Pardofigueroa appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and 27-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction to Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Fraud and Misuse of Documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), and False Statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Pardofigueroa also contends that the district holding guidelines to be only advisoryholding that the preponderance standard is generally appropriate in guidelines sentencingrecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standardholding that the district court determines the amount of loss under the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that under the advisory guidelines a district court should resolve factual disputes at sentencing by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\n"}

Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim. The Walker court noted that Rule 9 was inapplicable, and held that \u201cit is enough in pleading a conspiracy to merely indicate the parties, general purpose, and approximate date, so that the defendant has notice of what he is charged with.\u201d Id. The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy.

As such, the Court rejects Plaintiff's holding breach of best execution duty is a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of the securitiesholding that a plaintiff alleging securities fraud must show that a defendant 1 made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he or she had a duty to speak 2 with scienter 3 in connection with the purchase or sale of securitiesholding that evidence was sufficient to support convictions for willfully engaging in fraudulent conduct in connection with sale of securities because kjnowledge that the act violates the securities laws is not relevantholding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase sale or issuance of the instrumentholding that 1 even if some conduct is not actionable as securities fraud that conduct cannot support a civil rico claim if it was also undertaken in connection with the purchase of a security and 2 conduct in maintaining ponzi scheme was conduct undertaken in connection with the purchase or sale of securities & \n\n75, 76, 81, 83, 84, 91, 92, 94, 102, 105. The court finds these alleged statements insufficient because they are unaccompanied by facts which demonstrate their accuracy or Defendants\u2019 involvement or control in their preparation. Moreover, as recently determined by one court in this district: \u201ca plaintiff cannot meet the requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) merely by pleading the specific time, place, and contents of misleading statements by a specifically identified analyst. Rather, to hold a defendant liable for misleading statements published by a third party, the plaintiff must at least identify the defendant who provided the information that the third party made public to the market.\u201d Barrie, 2002 WL 1841631, * 3; see also Suna v.

It is irrelevant what else Platt might have learned through further diligent investigation after 1999 about UL\u2019s misrepresentations or intent to deceive Platt and others regarding the Cadet heaters\u2019 safety, because in 1999 Platt already knew that UL\u2019s prior representations about the heaters\u2019 safety were false, and that knowledge was sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations for fraud under California law.

Indeed, the Second Circuit has made clear holding that financial gain from compensation for professional services is not a sufficient motive for purposes of pleading scienterholding the pslra standard for pleading scienter is more stringent than the second circuits standard prior to the act and that motive and opportunity is not an independent basis to show defendants had scienterholding that access to financial information was reasonably related to a defendants narcotics convictions because financial gain motivated the underlying crimesholding that in pleading scienter arguing that the motive for defrauding investors was to increase the companys profits or to increase officer compensation is not sufficientholding that allegations of motive and opportunity were not enough to create a strong inference of scienter & \n\nto civil in rem forfeiture matters whenever doing so did: (1) not conflict with any provision of the Forfeiture Act; and (2) facilitated the orderly, fair and efficient course of proceedings and disposition of the matter. In my view, those cases provided a practical approach to disposition, keeping in mind that a civil forfeiture proceeding is much like a trial, the objective of which is to provide the parties with a full and fair opportunity to present evidence in support of their respective positions and, on that evidence, render a just disposition. 2 . For example, trial courts will be left without fair and efficient guidelines and procedures for the exchange of information. See Commonwealth v. $8,006.00 U.S. Currency Seized from Carter, 166 Pa.Cmwlth. 251, 646 A.2d 621 (1994) (<HOLDING>).

It is quite another to impose liability for prescribing a drug that had no connection with a birth defect. In one ease, the condition is the foreseeable result of the doctor\u2019s omission; in the other, it is not. The majority\u2019s result is unprecedented in any jurisdiction. In every previous failure-to-warn case, the harm about which the doctors failed to warn was the harm that in fact occurred. See, e.g., Estate of Doe v.

While all three of these crimes connote some element of dishonesty, they do not necessarily involve fraud per se. So, as a general matter, they would be subject to the general notice pleading standard. Rose v. Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 356 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cThus, the suggestion that \u2018[a] charge of racketeering, with its implications of links to organized crime, should not be easier to make than accusations of fraud appears unwarranted.\u2019 \u201d) For that reason, each would not be subjected to the higher pleading standard required of fraud.

Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has found other state laws that have no relationship to damages to be substantive in FELA cases. See, e.g., Dice v.

Plaintiffs contend that the Andersen defendants were motivated to participate in the fraud because of personal gain. However, they have alleged no gain other than the fact that the Andersen firm was compensated for its professional services. It would defy common sense to hold that the motive element of the Beck scienter analysis would be satisfied merely by alleging the receipt of normal compensation for professional services rendered, because to do so would effectively abolish the requirement, as against professional defendants in a securities fraud action, of pleading facts which support a strong inference of scienter. Cf. Wilson v. Saintine Exploration and Drilling Corp., 872 F.2d 1124 (2d Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>).

Farmer, 430 U.S. at 305, 97 S.Ct. 1056. Thomas has not met either of these requirements. Therefore, because Thomas\u2019s wrongful discharge and civil conspiracy claims amount to a claim for a breach of the duty of fair representation and a Farmer exception to preemption does not apply, Thomas\u2019s claims are preempted by federal labor law. Because Thomas did not bring a federal claim within the applicable six-month statute of limitations for claims asserting a violation of the duty of fair representation, such a federal claim is now barred as untimely. See DelCostello v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 169-70, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2293-94, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983) (<HOLDING>); Arnold v.

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements. Given that role, Stern had a duty to disclose any known information necessary to prevent the Official Statements from being false or misleading. See Howard, 228 F.3d at 1061 (<HOLDING>). Allstate has further alleged that Stern holding a defendant may be convicted of mail fraud if he knowingly and willfully participates in a fraudulent scheme created and set in motion by othersholding that no judgment can be rendered against defendant who cannot be held liableholding that a person violates the bank fraud statute when he knowingly executes a scheme to obtain money from a financial institution by means of false or fraudulent representations if a defendant knowingly provided materially false information in order to induce the loan the crime is complete and it is irrelevant whether or not he intended to repay or was capable of repaying itholding that a defendant can be held liable when it knowingly participates in the creation of a false or misleading statementholding that the elements of a claim under 3729a2 are 1 that the defendant made used or caused to be made or used a record or statement to get a claim against the united states paid or approved 2 the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent and 3 the defendant knew that the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent emphasis added & \n\nis subjected to the heightened pleading standard of Iqbal and Twombly \u201d). Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

See Cencast Servs., L.P. v. United States, 91 Fed.Cl. 496, 503 (2010) (<HOLDING>).

As to loss of use, Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot show any loss of use of its property as a result of C8 contamination.

Public entities generally may not bring holding that where a city brought a public nuisance claim based on asbestos in its buildings it had essentially pleaded a products liability action not a nuisance actionholding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue a permanent nuisance action for injury to property because none of the plaintiffs were the owners of the land when the cause of action accrued with the first injuryrecognizing products liability and products actions based on negligence as part of the general maritime lawholding that the viability of a negligence action against a municipality under 1147190 determines the success or failure of a nuisance action based upon the same factsrecognizing that substantial change is a defense to a products liability claim & \n\nin the child\u2019s mother, Procanik; for a child\u2019s cystic fibrosis on a doctor who failed to test a symptomatic sibling for that genetic disease, Sckroeder; or for a child\u2019s Down\u2019s Syndrome on a doctor who failed to warn a pregnant woman that her age put her at increased risk of delivering a child with that condition, Berman. It is quite another to impose liability for prescribing a drug that had no connection with a birth defect. In one ease, the condition is the foreseeable result of the doctor\u2019s omission; in the other, it is not. The majority\u2019s result is unprecedented in any jurisdiction. In every previous failure-to-warn case, the harm about which the doctors failed to warn was the harm that in fact occurred. See, e.g., Estate of Doe v. Vanderbilt Univ., 824 F.Supp. 746 (M.D.Tenn.1993) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v. United States, 575 F.Supp. 1309 holding that to recover damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress based on fear of contracting aids plaintiff must allege actual exposure to hivholding plaintiffs administrative complaint alleging negligent exposure to radiation established subject matter jurisdiction for plaintiffs civil claim alleging failure to warn of radiation exposureholding that where plaintiffs emotional distress was the direct result of documented physical injury and was reasonably foreseeable in light of the fact that the plaintiff may have been exposed to hiv he was not required to prove actual exposure to the disease in order to state a viable cause of actionholding that absent any proof that the plaintiff was in fact exposed to hiv he could not recover damages for his fear of contracting aidsholding medical providers who failed to warn mother about danger of exposure to hiv liable when baby born with hiv & \n\n\u201d Id. at 1079 (quoting Pilot Life, 481 U.S. at 52, 54, 107 S.Ct. 1549). Therefore, a state law is preempted if it adds to the judicial remedies available under ERISA. Id. (citing Rush Prudential, 536 U.S. at 379, 122 S.Ct. 2151). The Kentucky Act essentially creates a statutory bad faith claim. Cummings v. Thomas Industries, Inc., 812 F.Supp. 99, 101 (W.D.Ky.1993) (citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Reeder, 763 S.W.2d 116, 118 (Ky.1988)). A plaintiff may recover \u201csuch damages as he sustained by reason of the violation\u201d of the Act. Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 446.070. The plain language of this statute permits, at a bare minimum, compensatory damages. In addition, a plaintiff can recover damages for anxiety and mental anguish. FB Ins. Co. v. Jones, 864 S.W.2d 926, 929 (Ky.Ct.App.1993) (<HOLDING>). By comparison, ERISA limits plaintiffs holding that wifes recovery for loss of consortium should not be reduced by the proportion of negligence attributable to husband because claim for loss of consortium is independent of the damages claim of the injured spouseholding the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that the plaintiff could be awarded damages for anxiety mental anguish and loss of consortium for a violation of the kentucky actrecognizing cause of action for loss of consortiumholding that trial court did not errrecognizing loss of consortium claims & \n\n1 A.3d 658, 671 (2010). In addressing this issue, the District Court looked to a 1998 district court opinion that predicted that the New Jersey Supreme Court would not allow an affirmative cause of action for intentional spoliation, Larison v. City of Trenton, 180 F.R.D. 261, 266 (D.N.J.1998). The New Jersey Supreme Court has since authorized tort recovery for intentional spoliation. See Rosenblit, 766 A.2d at 758. Moreover, when it did so, the New Jersey Supreme Court did not adopt the strict causation and damages theories propounded by Larison. Compare Larison, 180 F.R.D. at 266 (predicting that a prima facie case could not be established unless and until the plaintiff shows that he failed to prove his original case because of the missing evidence), with Tartaglia, 961 A.2d at 1190 (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, plaintiffs did not have to holding that where an express contract was in place between plaintiff and defendant that governed the compensation sought by plaintiff plaintiff may not recover under a theory of unjust enrichmentrecognizing that if the plaintiff files suit in a county where venue does not lie the plaintiff waives the right to choose and the defendant may have the suit transferred to a proper venueholding by new jersey supreme court that a plaintiff may recover from a spoliator even if the plaintiff prevails in the original suitrecognizing israel had no interest in denying its citizens the substantive advantages of new jersey defamation law in new jersey residents claims for defamation published in new jerseyrecognizing that pennsylvania had no interest in denying its residents the greater damages available under new jersey consumer fraud statutes for claims against a new jersey seller & \n\nbecause of the fear that their results would become public knowledge. \u00a7 381.004(1), Fla. Stat. (Supp.1996). The specific safeguards provided by the statute to prevent disclosure lend weight to the argument that public dissemination of the test results would cause emotional distress, and thus Continental should have known that by sending the results in an unsecured fax, it was risking causing great emotional distress to the Abrils if an unauthorized party saw the test results. Because the only reasonable damages arising from a breach of section 381.004(3)(f) are emotional distress, and because this emotional damage would be akin to that suffered by victims of defamation or invasion of privacy, we conclude they should not be barred by the impact rule. See Gracey, 837 So.2d at 356-57 (<HOLDING>). Thus, based on our recent precedent in Gracey holding that the victim impact and victim vulnerability aggravators were not overbroad and explaining that though the concepts of victim impact and victim vulnerability may well be relevant in every case evidence of victim vulnerability and victim impact in a particular case is inherently individualizedholding in a fcra case that plaintiffs may not rely on mere conclusory statements rather they must sufficiently articulate true demonstrable emotional distress including the factual context in which the emotional distress arose evidence corroborating the testimony of the plaintiff the nexus between the conduct of the defendant and the emotional distress the degree of such mental distress mitigating circumstances if any physical injuries suffered due to the emotional distress medical attention resulting from the emotional duress psychiatric or psychological treatment and the loss of income if anyholding that the impact rule should not bar recovery because the emotional distress that plaintiffs allege they have suffered is at least equal to that typically suffered by the victim of a defamation or an invasion of privacy and that ijmposition of the impact rule in this context would render the legislative intent and its statutory implementation meaningless and without substanceholding emotional distress suffered must be severe and not trivialholding that employee could not state a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress under fela without a showing of physical impact & \n\nwith the debtor refused to pay the purchase price. The debtor sued on the contract claim in the bankruptcy court. The defendant corporation objected to the bankruptcy court\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that the debtor\u2019s claim was a state contract action thereby making the proceeding non-core. The defendant asked the bankruptcy court to abstain, forcing the debtor to sue in state court and permitting the defendant to insist on a jury trial. Although the bankruptcy court agreed that the proceeding was non-core, it declined to abstain. See In re Arnold Print Works, Inc., 54 B.R. 562, 569 (Bankr.D.Mass.1985) (citing Mohawk Industries, supra). The defendant corporation then appealed the jurisdictional issue. The district court also concluded that the proceeding was n 6 (Bankr.N.D.Ga.1985) (<HOLDING>); See also In re Epi-Scan, Inc., 71 B.R. 975 holding an action to recover a postpetition account receivable to be coreholding plaintiff could not recover on nuisance action to recover for alleged damage to property he does not own or rentholding that a postpetition claim under section 1305 is a liability that arises postpetition and relates only to postpetition activityholding an action for postpetition breach of an agreement to purchase property to be a core proceedingholding that debt from debtor to bank in the form of chargebacks to the debtors account for credit card transaction rescissions was prepetition debt even though customers rescinded transactions postpetition and the bank therefore chargedback postpetition because a customers right to rescind and thereby the banks right to chargeback accrued at the time the customer made a purchase even though such customer exercised his right to rescind postpetition & \n\nbring an individual action under \u00a7 1132(a)(3). See 516 U.S. 489, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). Although Varity interpreted \u00a7 1132(a)(3) to authorize individual suits, its holding is not as broad as Wilson contends. The Supreme Court ruled that an individual can sue under \u00a7 1132(a)(3), but he or she must: (1) only seek equitable relief, and (2) have no more specific means of relief available. See Varity, 516 U.S. at 508-15, 116 S.Ct. 1065; Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, 127 F.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1997). Wilson\u2019s claim seeks damages in the amount of the rehabilitation expenses, not injunctive relief. Furthermore, the remedy for a claim that a plan participant\u2019s benefits were improperly denied is specifically provided for in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). See Turner, 127 F.3d at 200 (<HOLDING>). Thus, even if Wilson amended Count V, he holding that an individual who brings a lawsuit pursuant to 1132a1b to challenge a denial of disability benefits does not also have a right to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty under 1132a3holding that 1132a1b affords the plaintiff adequate relief for her benefits claim and a cause of action under 1132a3 is thus not appropriateholding that action to recover erisa benefits under the subject plan are legal in nature and that plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to trial by jury on any claim raised under 1132a1bholding plaintiff had no claim under 1132a3 because his grievance that benefits were denied is specifically addressed in 1132a1bholding that no ada violation was shown because the disabled were not denied benefits that were otherwise available & \n\nnoneconomic damage awards. A defendant is liable to a claimant only for the percentage of the damages found by the trier of fact equal to that defendant\u2019s percentage of responsibility unless the percentage of responsibility attributed to the defendant is greater than 50% or the defendant engaged in particular conduct listed in the penal code. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.013(a), (b) (West 2008). Here, the jury found LMS 30% responsible and found Hospital 60% responsible. Based on our above holding that legally insufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s joint enterprise finding and the fact that the jury assessed only 30% responsibility against LMS, LMS cannot be jointly and severally liable with Hospital for the entire judgment. See id.; Able, 35 S.W.3d at 616 (<HOLDING>); Shoemaker, 513 S.W.2d at 14 (same). recognizing as viable actions in tort negligent hiring and negligent retentionrecognizing that each party in a joint enterprise is responsible for the negligent act of the otherholding that the jones act did not operate to make negligent crew members liable to their employers for damages paid to other seamen under the jones act because crew members cannot sue each other for negligenceholding that a clause providing that the insurer has a right to recover damages from a responsible third party referred to a tortfeasor because the use of damages in bodily injury cases means pecuniary compensation resulting from an unlawful or negligent act by a wrongdoerholding that for a plaintiff to recover on claim of negligent hiring the negligent hiring of the employee must have been the proximate cause of the injury at issue & \n\nrequire a showing of actual harm when a plaintiff sues for willful violations.\u201d Robins v. Spokeo, Inc., 742 F.3d 409, 412 (9th Cir.2014). The court reasoned that when, as with the FCRA, \u201cthe statutory cause of action does not require proof of actual damages, a plaintiff can suffer a violation of the statutory right without suffering actual damages.\u201d Id. at 413; see also 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681n(a)(1)(A) (\u201cAny person who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed [under the FCRA] with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of \u2014 any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than $100 and not more than $1000.\u201d (emphasis added); Bateman v. Am. Multi-Cinema, Inc., 623 F.3d 708, 719 (9th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>); Montgomery v.

Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant Lee on De Contreras\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. B. De Contreras\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Claim Against Lee and Mastaler for Fabricating Police Reports The record lacks any evidence to support Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Lee or Mastaler fabricated their police reports. Furthermore, as De Contreras was convicted on the charges alleged in the police reports (see April 9, 2012 Minute Order Granting Motion to Dismiss at 7 (Doc. No. 42)), he cannot now challenge the validity of those police reports under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (<HOLDING>) Thus, Defendants are entitled to summary holding that a plaintiff requesting relief under 1983 had no cause of action unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed expunged invalidated or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpusholding that to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a 42 usc 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal or called into question by federal courts issuance of writ of habeas corpus footnote omittedrecognizing that 1983 action does not accrue until conviction or sentence has been invalidatedholding that a claim for damages that would invalidate a conviction or sentence that has not already been invalidated or reversed on direct appeal by executive order by an authorized state tribunal or by a writ of habeas corpus is not cognizable under 1983holding that in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal courts issuance of a writ of habeas corpus & \n\nnot necessarily or immediately result in his earlier release, but would set in motion a process that will have that consequence if he prevails. In Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh, 864 F.2d 804, 808-10 (D.C.Cir.1988) (en banc), this court had held that a federal prisoner seeking to challenge his parole eligibility date was required to proceed in habeas, even though success upon his claims would not necessarily result in his earlier release. Later, however, in Anyanwutaku v. Moore, 151 F.3d 1053, 1055-57 (D.C.Cir. 1998), we permitted a District of Columbia prisoner to challenge his parole eligibility date in a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In the latter case, we relied primarily upon two Supreme Court cases, Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (<HOLDING>), and Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. holding that the district court mischaracterized a state prisoners 1983 claim as a petition for writ of habeas corpus because the prisoner did not attack his conviction challenge the fact or length of his confinement or seek immediate release from prisonholding that that if the success of a 1983 damages claim brought by a prisoner would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence the prisoner may only bring the claim where the conviction or sentence has been invalidatedholding that to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a 42 usc 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal or called into question by federal courts issuance of writ of habeas corpus footnote omittedholding that a state prisoner must bring his claim in habeas only if by prevailing he would necessarily prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinementholding that in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal courts issuance of a writ of habeas corpus & \n\nto alleviate the confusion. 239 Ga. at 128-129. 8 See, e.g., City of Columbus v.

This, the court believes, is precisely what the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception encompasses. 10 . Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\n"}

He says that the trial justice denied the motion based \u201con an opinion not fact.\u201d Kowal has offered only a vague religiously oriented argument about why the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction over him.

In assessing the validity of appellant\u2019s claim, we must first address the reach of the Second Amendment. \u201cIt is settled law ... that the Second Amendment applies only to limitations the federal government seeks to impose on this right.\u201d Maloney v.

The former include only rights the Federal Constitution grants or the national government enables, but not those preexisting rights the Bill of Rights merely protects from federal invasion. Id. at 76-80, 21 L.Ed. 394. The Second Amendment protects a right that predates the Constitution; therefore, the Constitution did not grant it. See, e.g., Heller, 128 S.Ct. at 2797 (\u201c[I]t has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right.\u201d). It necessarily follows that the Privileges or Immunities Clause did not protect the right to keep and bear arms because it was not a right of citizens of the United States. See Cruikshank, 92 U.S. at 553; cf.

The public entities defined in the ADA are state or local governments and their instrumentalities. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1). The United States, its agencies, and employees are not public entities under the ADA. Cellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC, 217 F.3d 72, 73 (2d Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Aquino v. Prudential Life & Cas. Ins.

Thus, the State agencies return to their point, discussed above, that Congressional action is necessary to enforce the Takings Clause against the states. {45} We do not find the argument persuasive. It is Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment in conjunction with the \u201cjust compensation\u201d remedy found in the Takings Clause that abrogates state sovereign immunity. Section 5 gives Congress the power to create remedies, if Congress decides any are necessary, to enforce the rights found in the Fourteenth Amendment, including those found in Section 1. An example of such legislation, protecting against the denial of due process is Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101; see also Tennessee v.

Lucas names no individual officers. The Ex Parte Young exception applies only in actions against individual state officers, and not to state agencies. See id. Therefore, the Ex Parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is inapplicable here, thus barring action against the Board. For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM the dismissal of the declaratory judgment by the District Court. 1 . On appeal, Lucas cites two exceptions to the doctrine of Ex Parte Young. See Idaho v.

The Bisby Court held that a defendant\u2019s attempt to introduce evidence at the punishment phase of the trial that he was not the person who shot complainant was irrelevant because it concerned his guilt or innocence, not the proper punishment. Bisby, 907 S.W.2d at 959-60. Likewise, the Garcia Court upheld the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the defendant\u2019s attempt to introduce impeachment evidence that the State\u2019s witnesses had consumed more alcohol at the time of the incident than they had admitted to because \u201c[s]uch impeachment evidence might be collateral testimony regarding appellant\u2019s guilt, but would be of no import in determining punishment so as to require reversal.\u201d Garcia, 704 S.W.2d at 499; see also Oregon v.

To disallow a citizen legal redress to contest a law on the grounds that it violates the single-subject clause is a clear threat to the essential nature of the operation of the legislative branch of state government as guaranteed by the constitution. The joinder of two or more unconnected matters in a bill is no mere irregularity. The single-subject clause goes to the heart of the legislative process mandated by the people of the State of Iowa when they adopted our constitution. Therefore, I would apply the doctrine of great public importance, waive the requirement of standing, and allow Godfrey\u2019s challenge to proceed. See Sloan v.

De Contreras\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Claim Against Lee and Mastaler for Fabricating Police Reports The record lacks any evidence to support Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Lee or Mastaler fabricated their police reports. Furthermore, as De Contreras was convicted on the charges alleged in the police reports (see April 9, 2012 Minute Order Granting Motion to Dismiss at 7 (Doc.

In response, the objecting Defendants argue that re-filing this case in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, which is Plaintiffs admitted intention should the case be dismissed, would unfairly impose upon them the costs associated with submitting motions and other documents which have already been filed with this Court. These Defendants, however, apparently overlook the Court\u2019s power to levy costs and, furthermore, fail to demonstrate that they would suffer legal prejudice in the event of a dismissal.

IV. CONCLUSION The plain language of the Distribution Agreement compels a conclusion that the right of first refusal does not apply in a dissolution action where the court-appointed receiver is procuring the sale of the corporate assets. The receiver, not the survivor or the personal representative, is the procuring party, and the receiver\u2019s actions are taken under the supervision, and with the approval, of the trial court. Had the parties to the Distribution Agreement intended for the right of first refusal to apply in the context of a corporate dissolution, or where a third party was procuring a buyer, the Distribution Agreement could have so provided. See, e.g., Roof Depot, Inc. v. Ohman, 638 N.W.2d 782 (Minn.Ct. App.2002) (<HOLDING>); Guice v.

As the court explained, however, the plaintiff police officers in that case complained of an ongoing constitutional injury due to the conflict between local law enforcement duties and the federal law at issue. See Fraternal Order, 152 F.3d at 1001. Navegar and its progeny, as well as the present case, deal with the potential of prosecutions that could cause injury only in the future, if at all. 4 . Plaintiffs in each case asked for and were granted dismissal without prejudice rather than transfer so that they could appeal immediately. They did appeal, but neither appeal was successful.

Our concurring colleague, Judge Katzmann, disagrees with our characterization of the quoted language as dictum. In his view, the Supreme Court would not have vacated the state judgment of conviction if it had not been satisfied that Faretta knowingly exercised his right to self-representation; thus, the Court\u2019s discussion of what constitutes a \"knowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of the right to counsel \u201cwas essential to its conclusion that Faretta\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\u201d Infra at 566. We are not convinced. Given Faretta's recognition of a constitutional right to represent oneself, the Court might well have vacated the state conviction and remanded the case even without a finding of a valid waiver of the right t 1984) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

As the district court observed, application holding that a review committee of the kansas board for discipline of attorneys had the authority to dismiss a complaint against an attorney with or without prejudice and when dismissal was ordered without specifying the nature of the dismissal the dismissal was without prejudice to the filing of later proceedings on the same matterholding that the dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiffs first action doomed his ada claim because the ninetyday filing period had runholding that proper remedy for failure to exhaust is dismissal of the claim without prejudiceholding borough could not appeal dismissal of complaint without prejudice because dismissal without prejudice is comparable to a nonsuit under the former practice of lavf holding district court had no authority to require plaintiffs to obtain courts permission to dismiss defendant who had not served answer or motion for summary judgment as plaintiffs had absolute right to dismissal without prejudice and thus court could not sanction plaintiffs for filing notice of voluntary dismissal rather than motion & \n\nCURIAM: Robert Holland Koon seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2). The district court\u2019s order stemmed from Koon\u2019s request that the court dismiss his petition without prejudice in order to allow him to exhaust his state remedies. A Rule 41(a)(2) voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. See Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 809 F.2d 548, 555 (9th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>), overruled in part on other grounds by Moore holding borough could not appeal dismissal of complaint without prejudice because dismissal without prejudice is comparable to a nonsuit under the former practice of lavf holding that dismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim should generally be without prejudice but if the plaintiff has been given an opportunity amend his complaint and fails to do so the dismissal may be with prejudiceholding that this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a stipulated voluntary dismissal with prejudice unless it was intended to settle the caseholding that a plaintiff generally may not appeal a voluntary dismissal without prejudice because it is not an involuntary adverse judgment against himholding appeal improper since the dismissal was voluntary & \n\nare you aware of whether or not Eligi\u00f3 [Saenz] has any other method of getting to a public roadway, other than through Mrs. Thrash\u2019s property and through your property? A. He\u2019s even going through my, my easement that I bought outright several times, and also through the ranch, through other places. [Emphasis added] Q. Through what other places sir? A. Through mine and Bazans and Manuel Reyes too. He\u2019s been using it, not right now because he locked the gates. [Emphasis added] Xavier Reyes\u2019 testimony raises a genuine issue of material fact on whether the Saenzes have other possible legal means of access to their property and on whether access across the Reyeses\u2019 property is a necessity, as opposed to a mere convenience. See Mitchell v. Castellaw, 151 Tex. 56, 246 S.W.2d 163, 168 (1952) (<HOLDING>). CONCLUSION We conclude the Saenzes failed to holding it is a question of factholding that whether the defendants confession was voluntary was a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo reviewholding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that probable cause determination presents a mixed question of law and factholding the question of necessity is one of mixed law and fact and accordingly one for the fact finder in the ordinary case & \n\nrelief from judgment pursuant to rule 1.540(b)(1), (2), or (3). In support of its argument that the foreclosure judgment is void, Sterling cites Shields v. Flinn, 528 So.2d 967 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988). In Shields, the Third District declared a judgment void two years after the entry of the judgment because the defendant, over whom the court had personal jurisdiction, had been given no notice of the trial date and had not appeared for the trial. Id.; see also Hammett v. Hammett, 510 So.2d 632 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987) (concluding in a one-paragraph opinion that a party\u2019s failure to receive notice of hearing at which the judgment was entered entitled that party to relief from the judgment pursuant to rule 1.540(b)(4)); Falkner v. Amerifirst Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 489 So.2d 758 (Fla. 3d DCA 1986) (<HOLDING>). These Third District cases, however, predate holding that dismissal with leave to amend is not a final orderholding that plaintiffs dismissal of personal injury action and subsequent dismissal of declaratory judgment action concerning extent of tortfeasors insurance coverage did not trigger double dismissal ruleholding that a plaintiffs voluntary dismissal of his claims with prejudice constituted a final order that was appealableholding dismissal for failure to comply with rule 8 was dismissal of entire action which was appealable final orderholding that plaintiffs were entitled to vacate final order of dismissal as void when they did not receive the motion for dismissal or notice of the hearing on the order until after the dismissal was entered & \n\nit be argued that the timeliness of appellants' bad faith claim depended upon our Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Miller was a permissive user of Madalyn Gower\u2019s vehicle, which ruling required appellee to pay the policy limits. A bad faith action under section 8371 is neither related to nor dependent on the underlying contract claim against the insurer. See March v. Paradise Mutual Insurance Co., 435 Pa.Super. 597, 646 A.2d 1254 (1994) (\u201ca claim brought under section 8371 is a cause of action which is separate and distinct from the underlying contract claim.\u201d). As a result, Miller (and, by extension, appellants) were not required to wait until the merits of the contract claim were decided to file suit for bad faith. See Boring v. Erie Insurance Group, 434 Pa.Super. 40, 641 A.2d 1189 (1984) (<HOLDING>); and Margolies v. State Farm Fire & Casualty holding dismissal for failure to comply with rule 8 was dismissal of entire action which was appealable final orderholding arbitration decision disallowing insurers coverage defense binding in subsequent personal injury action where the issue was actually litigated and decided in prior actionholding that although the issue of coverage had not yet been decided appellants action under 8371 was a separate claim and the dismissal of that claim was instantly appealableholding voluntary dismissal permissible because trial court had not yet reached a decision on the meritsholding that plaintiffs dismissal of personal injury action and subsequent dismissal of declaratory judgment action concerning extent of tortfeasors insurance coverage did not trigger double dismissal rule & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N. LaSalle, 190 B.R. at 585 (noting \u201cthe lack of any clear standard for determining the fairness of a discrimination in the treatment of classes under a chapter 11 plan\u201d and that \u201cthe limits of fairness in this context have not been established\u201d). Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\nperiod normally was limited to the current fiscal year or legislative session, rarely reaching back more than a year. Though the time period of retroactivity is particularly long here, such a concern is in part offset by the failure of the Plaintiffs to articulate a vested right with which the New Law interferes, as well as by the specific context of trade duties. In examining the nature and circumstances of the New Law, the court notes that customs duties are to an extent unique from other government assessments in that there is no right to import, and where unfair trade remedies apply, those with goods that may be imported rarely can predict with accuracy what the duty will be. See Norwegian Nitrogen Prods. Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 318, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933) (<HOLDING>). For example, when goods become the subject of holding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionrecognizing that as with tax rates no one has a legal right to the maintenance of an existing rate or dutyholding that with respect to the eaja the local or national market rate for legal services cannot be a special factor used to increase the rate beyond the statutory rateholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that a utility can claim no rate as a legal right that is other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the commission & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\na reasonable foundation upon which to make the offer, a finding which must be made by the trial court after conducting an evidentiary hearing thereon). Ormond Beach also claims that the trial court erred in denying its request for statutory offer of judgment attorney\u2019s fees because its offer of judgment and amended offer of judgment \u201cundeniably satisfied the requirements of section 768.79\u201d. Ormond Beach argues that since it satisfied the procedural requirements of section 768.79 of the Florida Statute, the court trial erred in denying its request for fees. We disagree. Our supreme court has ruled that, upon voluntary dismissal of an action without prejudice, statutory offer of judgment attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable. See MX Investments, Inc., v. Crawford, 700 So.2d 640 (Fla.1997)(<HOLDING>). Thus, once the trial court recognized holding proper basis for award of feesholding attorney fees not allowable as costsholding a summary judgment to be final although motion to assess attorney fees remained pending because award of attorney fees is collateral to judgmentholding that offer of judgment statute does not provide a basis for an award of attorney fees and costs unless dismissal is with prejudicerecognizing that an award of temporary attorneys fees and costs is based on an assessment of need and ability to pay as well as the reasonableness of the fees and costs & \n\nfactor seven, the relative bargaining power of the parties, weighs against a finding that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily made the waiver. An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin. Servs. Co., 191 F.Supp.2d at 814 (<HOLDING>). Consequently, Bank of America failed to meet holding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntaryrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding under similar facts as a matter of law that a knowing and voluntary waiver of powells right to a jury trial has not been demonstratedholding waiver of right to counsel not voluntary and knowing when defendant terminated counsel and requested another attorney but the trial court would allow delay and appointment only upon waiver of speedy trial right & \n\nlima M. Rodriguez, a native and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying suspension of deportation and voluntary departure. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. Where, as here, the BIA conducts a de novo review of the record, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. See De Leon-Barrios v. INS, 116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition. The BIA properly denied suspension of deportation because Rodriguez, who was deported in 1992, did not accrue the requisite seven years\u2019 continuous presence in the United States. Cf. Barragan-Sanehez v. Rosenberg, 471 F.2d 758, 760 (9th Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The BIA properly denied voluntary departure holding that an aliens continuous physical presence is broken if the alien was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw an application for admissionholding that the failure to notify aliens counsel of an order to appear for deportation violated the aliens statutory right to counselholding bia did not err in determining request for stay of voluntary departure is not an implicit request for a withdrawal of voluntary departureholding that aliens continuous presence in the country was interrupted by voluntary departure under threat of deportation proceedingsholding that because aliens two previous voluntary departures were the result of implied agreements and were not therefore strictly voluntary they constituted significant departures that precluded a finding of seven years continuous presence in the united states under a rule that excused absences that were brief casual and innocent & \n\nhelp establish the existence of an unconstitutional practice or custom \u2014 cannot be readily deduced from simply reading the definition of practice or custom in Model Instruction 9.4. See Model Instruction 9.4 (\u201c \u2018Practice or custom\u2019 means any permanent, widespread, well-settled practice or custom that constitutes a standard operating procedure of the defendant.\u201d); see also Norwood, 591 F.3d at 1067 (observing that \u201cjuries are not clairvoyant\u201d and will not know to follow a particular legal principle \u201cunless they are told to do so\u201d). Accordingly, in the context of this case the definition of practice or custom in Model Instruction 9.4 was \u201can incomplete, and therefore incorrect, statement of the law.\u201d Norwood, 591 F.3d at 1066; see also Fikes v. Cleghorn, 47 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Further, by stating that a practice or custom holding that if jury instructions viewed as a whole fairly state the applicable law to the jury the failure to give particular instructions will not be errorholding that a jury is presumed to follow the trial courts instructionsholding that the ninth circuit erred because the state appellate courts conclusion that one incorrect statement in jury instructions did not render the instructions likely to mislead the jury was not unreasonableholding that jury instructions must allow the jury to determine the issues presented intelligentlyholding that district court did not abuse its discretion in giving jury instructions that taken together fairly and adequately conveyed the issues to the jury & \n\n24.035 motion, however, the alleged Brady violation must be such that it supports a conclusion that the movant would not have pled guilty had he been provided with the undisclosed evidence. 1. Nondisclosure of mere impeachment evidence is insufficient to invalidate an otherwise voluntary plea. Although \u201c[t]he principles of Brady are applicable to the entry of a plea of guilty,\u201d Scroggins, 859 S.W.2d at 707, they are applicable only to the extent that the nondisclosed evidence is both exculpatory and material; a post-guilty-plea claim involving the nondisclosure of mere impeachment evidence (even if it might have been material in the context of a trial) is insufficient to invalidate an otherwise voluntary plea. U.S. v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 628-33, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (<HOLDING>). Here, the prior conviction evidence Wallar holding that a criminal defendant can waive important constitutional rights by entering into a plea bargainholding that defendant had ample opportunity to crossexamine government witness including the terms of a plea agreement and that further impeachment was speculative and minimal at bestholding the government has an affirmative duty to disclose exculpatory evidence to a criminal defendantholding that the appropriate sanction was to require the defendant to disclose the nature of the agreement with the witnessholding that the constitution does not require the government to disclose impeachment evidence prior to entering a plea agreement with a criminal defendant & \n\nCourts in rendering opinions\u201d on certain matters). This court concludes that, under Hawaii law, if an underlying action is dismissed against a nonconsenting defendant because it was a necessary condition of settlement with the other defendants in the underlying litigation, the dismissal with prejudice is not a dismissal on the substantive merits of the case and is therefore not a termination in favor of the nonconsenting defendant for malicious prosecution purposes. See Villa, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d at 649 (finding that \u201ceven where a defendant does not agree to a settlement made on his behalf, his or her dismissal from the lawsuit pur suant to that settlement will not be viewed as a favorable termination as long as it was a necessary condition to settlement\u201d); Haight, 244 Cal.Rptr. at 490 (<HOLDING>). This rule comports with Hawaii\u2019s public holding that plaintiffs were entitled to vacate final order of dismissal as void when they did not receive the motion for dismissal or notice of the hearing on the order until after the dismissal was enteredholding that a dismissal in the interest of justice can be a favorable termination under certain circumstancesholding that a dismissal of a defendant who did not agree to settlement is not a favorable termination if dismissal of that defendant was a condition of settlementholding that a settlement agreement is not a court order and therefore a violation of the settlement agreement would not subject a party to contemptholding that plaintiffs dismissal of personal injury action and subsequent dismissal of declaratory judgment action concerning extent of tortfeasors insurance coverage did not trigger double dismissal rule & \n\n(15) and OCGA \u00a7 16-6-8 (d) at their plain meaning, avoiding an interpretation that would result in surplusage, and applying the last-enacted rule, we conclude that \u201cpublic place\u201d includes \u201cjails and penal and correctional institutions of the state and its political subdivisions\u201d only in the context of the public-indecency statute.

While we do not condone the Firm\u2019s alleged misconduct here, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs allegation of \u201chonesty and fidelity\u201d in the legal system satisfies the supreme court\u2019s \u201cnarrow definition of public policy\u201d in retaliatory discharge cases.

Two caveats must accompany the League court\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute\u2019s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 351-52, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989) (<HOLDING>). Under the Compact, an EIS needs to include holding that an eis must consider the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided by discussing possible mitigation measuresrecognizing that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense a party must plead and proveholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleadedholding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by a true inconsistencyholding that perfunctory description of mitigation measures was inadequate & \n\nwitness list (contrary to his assertion at trial that the presiding officer \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything\u201d) this was not an arraignment. Rather, this was a preliminary and informal meet ing to establish what would be required for the SCM trial proceeding. We find this to be no different than a military judge requiring counsel to submit a docketing request that includes anticipated pleas and forum, and proposed trial dates. See Army Reg. 27-10, Legal Services, Military Justice, para. 5-21 (16 Nov. 2005). As indicated by the lack of a recorder and the informality of the meeting, the purpose of the initial meeting was not to formally call upon appellant to enter pleas, but to properly prepare the presiding officer for what he would need in order to conduct the SCM. See Jackson, 41 C.M.R. at 681 (<HOLDING>).

Ah appropriate regard for the delicate balance between state and national judicial authority counsels that, insofar as feasible, decisions relating to the jurisdiction and remedial capacity of the Delaware state courts \u2014 decisions central to the resolution of this case \u2014 be made by the Delaware courts themselves. (c) Our concern about the remedy available in the Delaware courts arises in part from the potential tension between the decision of the Court of Chancery in Delaware Bankers Ass\u2019n v. Division of Revenue of the Dep\u2019t of Finance, 298 A.2d 352, 356 (Del.Ch.1972) (<HOLDING>), and that of the Superior Court in Tatten recognizing that in some circumstances an afterthefact remedy under state law may be adequateholding that in some rcases there is an adequate remedy at law for an attack on an illegal or unconstitutional tax through the tax appeal boardholding that the granting or denial of an urban renewal tax exemption is reviewable by tax appealholding refund of discriminatory tax required because predeprivation remedy not clearly available for tax years at issueholding that massachusetts provides an adequate remedy for challenging a real estate tax assessment & \n\nentities like GasPlus. See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>).

Our concurring colleague, Judge Katzmann, disagrees with our characterization of the quoted language as dictum. In his view, the Supreme Court would not have vacated the state judgment of conviction if it had not been satisfied that Faretta knowingly exercised his right to self-representation; thus, the Court\u2019s discussion of what constitutes a \"knowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of the right to counsel \u201cwas essential to its conclusion that Faretta\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\u201d Infra at 566. We are not convinced. Given Faretta's recognition of a constitutional right to represent oneself, the Court might well have vacated the state conviction and remanded the case even without a finding of a valid waiver of the right t 1984) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

Title VII similarly requires employers to take remedial achon when they become aware that one of their employees has engaged in sexual harassment. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e; Faragher v.

All six (Martinez-Rios, Ramirez-Fajardo, Castaneda-Marin, Sanchez-Martinez, Ortiz-Cotoa and Carmargo-Silvera) were charged with conspiracy to possess and with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a) and 1903(j), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Carmargo-Silv-era pled guilty and testified on behalf of the government. The remaining five went to trial and were convicted. Discussion Defendants claim the district court erred by deciding, as a matter of law, that the MS was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as required by 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a). Defendants claim that jurisdiction is an element of the offense and should have been submitted for determination by the jury. See U.S. v. Ayarza-Garcia, 819 F.2d 1043, 1048-49 (11th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). Defendants claim they objected to the holding that claim construction is an issue of law for the court not a question of fact for the juryholding that generally the question of waiver and estoppel is a question of factrecognizing that under district of columbia law what the parties deem to be the material elements of their agreement either set forth in or absent from those documents is largely a question of fact for the jury and concluding in that case that whether an enforceable oral contract was created and was subsequently breached is a question of fact for the jury to decide not this courtholding it is a question of factholding under predecessor to 46 usc app 1903a that jurisdictional element of crime is question of fact for jury to decide & \n\nthe jury.\u201d). This is particularly true where the arrest occurred on January 31, 2007, over four years prior to the incident which gave rise to this action. Accordingly, evidence of Goodman\u2019s prior arrest to establish that she in fact engaged in acts of prostitution is excluded. In addition to using this evidence to establish truthfulness of any alleged defamatory statements, Defendants also seek its admission on the question of defamation damages. Although Goodman\u2019s, San Diego arrest may be minimally relevant to her reputation at the time she was detained at the Cosmopolitan, reputational damage is presumed in a slander per se action like this one, as explained below in the Court\u2019s discussion of Goodman\u2019s defamation claim. See Branda v. Sanford, 97 Nev. 643, 637 P.2d 1223, 1225 (1981) (<HOLDING>). This is because \u201c[a]t the heart of the libel- recognizing distinction between actual and per se conflicts of interestholding that under south carolina law slander is actionable per se where plaintiff is alleged to have committed adulteryholding that statements that insinuated that plaintiff was an adulteress were actionable as slander per se under missouri lawrecognizing that slander per se is actionable without a showing of actual or special damagesrecognizing continued vitality of kassowitz on what is slander per se & \n\ncommittee notes (1972) (describing rationale underlying exception as \u201c[t]he element of unusual reliability ... said variously to be supplied by systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation\u201d) (citation omit ted). Thus, the motivation of a record\u2019s author is relevant to admissibility. Id. Not every item of business correspondence constitutes a business record. See, e.g., Breeden v. ABF Freight System, Inc., 115 F.3d 749, 754 (10th Cir.1997) (sustaining exclusion of letter from chiropractor proffered as \u201cmedical business record\u201d); Timberlake Const. Co. v.

The plaintiff was afforded this post-deprivation remedy in the form of the two administrative appeals, brought pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415 and Conn. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 10-76L The plaintiff has not alleged that either of these appeals were procedurally defective. The court therefore concludes that the defendants afforded the plaintiff all the process that was due to him under the Due Process Clause. See Wenger v. Canastota Cent. Sch. Dist., 979 F.Supp. 147, 153 (N.D.N.Y.1997) (concluding that the plaintiffs, who requested and received an impartial hearing, were provided with an adequate post-deprivation remedy for alleged violations of the IDEA); see also \u201cBD\u201d v. DeBuono, 130 F.Supp.2d 401, 435 (S.D.N.Y.2000) (<HOLDING>). Based on the above, the court concludes that holding postdeprivation remedy is adequate even when deprivation was intentionalholding that the appellant had an adequate remedy by appeal for his discovery violation allegationsholding that idea administrative procedures provided an adequate post deprivation remedyholding that bivens plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies where administrative remedy program provided only for injunctive reliefholding that by its terms the idea does not require exhaustion where the relief sought is unavailable in an administrative proceeding under the idea monetary damages are not available so exhaustion is not required & \n\nfrequently made, to accommodate conditions such as plaintiffs insomnia, Kleiner\u2019s opinion is not framed in those terms. Rather, because Kleiner\u2019s opinion does not proffer any specialized knowledge, and invokes legal standards (\u25a0ie., that defendants could have accommodated plaintiffs disability without significant impact, and that defendants retaliated against plaintiff), his opinion would \u201cnot aid the jury in making a decision, but rather attempts to substitute [his] judgment for the jury\u2019s.\u201d See United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 102 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen this occurs, the expert acts outside of his limited role of providing the groundwork in the form of an opinion to enable the jury to make its own informed determination.\u201d); see also Hygh v.

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1, 4, 72 S.Ct. 1, 3, 96 L.Ed. 1 (1951) (\u201cThe right to release before trial is conditioned upon the accused\u2019s giving adequate assurance that he will stand trial and submit to sentence if found guilty.\u201d). Further, the statutory presumption that pretrial detention is appropriate in Medina\u2019s case does not violate his constitutional rights. The pre sumption, as applied in Medina\u2019s ease, arose following a determination by the magistrate that probable cause existed to believe Medina committed the crimes with which he was charged. Such a probable cause determination may be alone sufficient to justify detention pending trial. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114, 95 S.Ct. 854, 863, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975) (<HOLDING>); Schall v.

In support of its position, KCC relies on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in Williams that a twenty-five pound lifting restriction could not, as a matter of law, substantially limit the major life activity of working. Williams, 101 F.3d at 349. However, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision on this issue conflicts with the ADA\u2019s directives that the determination whe .3d at 349; Dutcher v. Ingalls Shipbuilding, 53 F.3d 723, 724-27 (5th Cir.1995) (stating that \u201d[o]ther major life activities could include lifting, reaching, sitting, or standing\u201d). The Supreme Court has, however, questioned in dicta whether \"working\u201d should be considered a major life activity under the ADA. See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (<HOLDING>). In Sutton, the Court entertained on the holding that disability determinations must be made with reference to corrective measuresholding that an employers awareness of an employees impairment without more is insufficient to demonstrate that the employer regarded the employee as disabledholding that the determination of whether an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that miti gate the individuals impairment including in this instance eyeglasses and contact lensesholding that the determination of whether an individual is an independent contractor lies in the common law and not under an express provision of the actholding that monocular vision is not invariably a disability but should be analyzed on an individual basis taking into account the individuals ability to compensate for the impairment & \n\nspecified different criminal penalties for violations of the Trafficking Act, which include restitution for a defendant\u2019s ill-gotten gains. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1593(b)(3). If the government wanted to seek penalties under the Trafficking Act, it was required to prosecute Defendants under the Trafficking Act. Having chosen to prosecute Defendants under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, it may seek only the penalties authorized by law for violations of that crime. The government has cited no authority \u2014 and we know of none \u2014 for the proposition that the district court may exceed its statutory authority simply because of the government\u2019s assertion that \u201cdefendants engaged in the same sort of behavior\u201d as a crime of which Defendants were not convicted.

Thus, the discrimination provision of the Act is not vague. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the harassment provision of the Act, \u00a7 709.338(6), is vague because the Act does not define \u201cunnecessarily harassing.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that patients may hold diverse views as to what constitutes unnecessary harassment. Plaintiffs argue that what conduct is prohibited thus depends on what a particular patient understands it to be, and that the resulting uncertainty as to what the Act prohibits \u201cis not permissible under the First Amendment.\u201d See Conant, 309 F.3d at 639 (<HOLDING>) (citing Collins, 323 U.S. at 535, 65 S.Ct. at holding that where the first amendment does not protect a certain activity there can be no first amendment right of association to engage in that activityholding a statute providing for administrative action against physicians who engage in speech that the patient believes to be a recommendation of marijuana lacks the requisite narrow specificity under the first amendmentholding statute criminalizing speech intended to influence a juror did not violate the first amendmentholding that first amendment protections apply to compelled speech as well as restrictions on speechholding that possession of marijuana is not protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment & \n\nadverse discrimination at all.

In fact, where doubt exists as to the proper construction, courts in workers\u2019 compensation eases should adopt the construction that will best effectuate the purpose of compensating the claimant for his disability.

In construing a statute, this Court is required to look at the entire statute, and construe it in pari materia, giving effect, if possible, to all provisions contained in the statute. Rhyne v.

Few statutes have been found so wanting in \u201crationality\u201d as to fail to satisfy the \u201cessentially arbitrary\u201d test. Stated positively, the test is that courts must uphold a statutory classification where it is rationally related to a legitimate government purpose. The rational basis test reflects the judiciary\u2019s awareness that it is up to legislatures, not courts, to decide the wisdom and utility of legislation, [Wysocki, 248 Mich App at 354 (quotation marks and citations omitted).] With regard to SORA in general, this C 16 (2007) (upholding the trial court\u2019s determination that the requirement of sex offender registration for \u201ccertain nonsexual abduction-related crimes\u201d was constitutional); People v Johnson, 225 Ill 2d 573, 591-592; 870 NE2d 415 (2007) (<HOLDING>); State v Sakobie, 165 NC App 447, 453; 598 holding evidence was legally insufficient to support conviction for violation of sex offender registration requirementholding that sex offender registration and notification do not constitute punishmentholding that the inclusion of aggravated kidnapping of a minor by a nonparent in the illinois sex offender registration act was not violative of due process regardless of whether the offenders conduct was sexually motivatedholding that classifying the defendant as a sexually oriented offender after he was convicted of kidnapping minors without a sexual purpose violated the defendants right to substantive due process where the statutory definition of sexual offender included one who had committed certain criminal offenses against a minor regardless of sexual intentholding that the requirement of sex offender registration for the defendants conviction of false imprisonment of a minor was not cruel and unusual punishment and did not violate substantive or procedural due process & \n\nhis testimony to what she had told him about her condition and what she had told him about how she was feeling.

Michaud herself testified as to her condition, that is, that both her blood pressure and blood sugar level increased and that Guarilia\u2019s treatment depressed her. Because the evidence is in the record through Michaud, there is no need for me to rely on Dr. Portnow's report of the same information. 11 . See Priest v. Interco, Inc.

This question should have indicated to Rhodes that there is a separate government entity responsible for adjudicating disputes over compensation claims that arise between workers and their employing agencies. Thus, Rhodes reasonably should have understood that this entity, rather than her employing agency, would receive her completed form. Thus, the workers\u2019 compensation form itself put Rhodes on notice that it would be sent to the Department of Labor. Because Rhodes could not reasonably have expected that her form would be hand-carried to that agency, a reasonably jury could conclude that Rhodes should have known that her form would be sent by mail. See United States v. Fore, 169 F.3d 104, 109 (2d Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). III.

See OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15. The interplay of OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 34-9-11 (a) and 34-9-15 (b), which this Court has not previously addressed, is informed by how we and the Court of Appeals have interpreted the interplay between the exclusive remedy provision and subsection (a) of OCGA\u00a7 34-9-15. (b) It is well established that a settlement under OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15 (a) which requires an employer to compensate its employee for an alleged injury bars a subsequent tort suit by the employee against anyone protected by the exclusive remedy provision, regardless of the actual circumstances of the employee\u2019s injury and the amount of compensation to which the parties agreed.

Whether the record supports other estimates of the value of Johnco stock is unclear. Because the Tax Court clearly erred in its approach to the discount of capital gains taxes on the Timber Property, this issue must be remanded for further consideration. B. The Family Settlement Agreement. The Estate argues that the Tax Court clearly erred in disregarding the share value set forth in Andrew and Dinah\u2019s Family Settlement Agreement. It notes that even the Tax Court recognized that the two negotiated at arm\u2019s length. The Estate asserts that Estate of Warren v.

The Department and the amici reason that lenders would have no incentive to obtain a license in order to charge higher interest rates, because they could capture that increase by charging high fees, thus rendering the statute useless at protecting the public against usury. 9 . Moreover, this Court has recognized that choice-of-law agreements can be avoided when the terms offend Commonwealth public policy even in disputes between contracting parties. See McIlvaine Trucking, Inc. v. W.C.A.B. (States), 570 Pa. 662, 672-73, 810 A.2d 1280, 1286 (2002) (<HOLDING>). Pennsylvania courts have consistently held holding that the trial courts authority to initiate workers compensation benefits before the final adjudication was not divested by the legislature and was consistent with the stated purpose of the workers compensation actholding that legislature clearly intended that workers compensation act and unemployment security act be construed together thus prohibiting worker from receiving both unemployment compensation and workers compensation payments for same periodholding that the parties choiceoflaw agreement as relating to workers compensation was appropriately avoided where it offended state public policy as reflected in express provisions of the pennsylvania workers compensation actholding that the provisions of the workers compensation act must be satisfied or the action is not maintainable in the courtsholding that provisions of section 40115102 are applicable to the determination of the status of truck drivers as employees or independent contractors under the workers compensation act and discussing legislative history indicating intent to apply these provisions both to workers compensation and unemployment compensation matters & \n\nwhere the rights of employees may be vindicated to the fullest extent possible under our workers\u2019 compensation statutory scheme. For example, in Pro-Football, Inc. v.

More importantly, counsel were also advised at the outset of this case and upon the finalization of the Fourth Amended Case Management Order that the Court would permit live testimony of experts at any Daubert hearing. (Docket No. 142, Tram. Hr\u2019g 9\/22\/09 at 25). Instead of proceeding in this fashion, Plaintiffs have submitted the declaration of Dr. Omalu for the purpose of rebutting the assertions of the defense experts regarding Dr. Omalu\u2019s opinions. See Fisher v. Clark Aiken Matik, Inc., Civ. A. No. 99-1976, 2005 WL 6182824, at *1 (M.D.Pa. Sept. 26, 2005) (<HOLDING>).

Gov\u2019t Mot. for Summ. J. at 6. It is true that Stein did not specifically contest this point in his appeal letter. He disputed the SEC\u2019s withholding decision under Exemption 7(A) \u2014 which, according to the SEC, was also the exemption under which the SEC was withholding some documents related to the second document category. See Compl., Ex. D at 1 n.l. But his appeal letter also specifically demanded \u2014 twice\u2014\u201call of the requested documents,\u201d not just documents related to the. first category. See Compl., Ex. E at 1-2. The government is obligated to construe FOIA requests \u2014 and appeals \u2014 liberally, where a request is \u201creasonably susceptible to the broader reading.\u201d See LaCedra v.

In the absence of habeas jurisdiction in the district courts, Petitioner fears that she will be deprived of an adequate and effective forum for judicial review. In such a situation, Petitioner argues, \u00a7 106 of the REAL ID Act constitutes an unlawful suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Id. In order to avoid a Suspension Clause violation, Petitioner argues that this court should interpret \u00a7 106 so that her case is not transferred to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. See St. Cyr., 533 U.S. at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (<HOLDING>) (internal quotations and citations omitted). holding that the rule of strict construction does not require the court to assign the narrowest possible interpretation to the statuteholding that if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is fairly possible we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problemsholding that when a court is asked to construe an ambiguous statute it must defer to the interpretation set out in a regulation promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute so long as the agencys interpretation is reasonableholding that we are to apply the legislative intent underlying a statute and to construe the statute in such a way as to prevent absurdityholding that the statute qualifies as an exemption 3 statute & \n\nuntil April 1998 the deadline for serious and severe nonattainment areas to submit their attainment demonstrations. See 64 Fed.Reg. at 70,398. Because not all SIPs contain MVEBs and because of the delay in the submission and approval of attainment demonstrations that do contain such budgets, it is entirely possible that some nonattainment areas subject to the conformity requirements may not have in place an approved SIP containing a MVEB. While the Clean Air Act generally contemplates that conformity determinations will be made by reference to approved SIPs, the Act simply does not address how conformity determinations should be made in the absence of an approved SIP with an adequate motor vehicle emissions budget. See Environmental Def. Fund v. EPA, 167 F.3d 641, 650 (D.C.Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). It therefore cannot be said that the EPA\u2019s holding that the statutory definition of motor vehicle is not controllingrecognizing that use of the then approved shotgun instruction would be improper if it coerced jury into agreement or unduly hastened their considerationrecognizing that language approved by the court may raise questions if incorporated in a jury instruction in a case with different factsholding that the sensible and popular understanding of what a motor vehicle accident entails necessarily involves the motor vehicle being operated as a motor vehicle recognizing that section 7506 does not dictate how conformity should be determined if no approved sip exists or if the approved sip contains no adequate motor vehicle emissions budget & \n\nwhereas before ... they were exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 327. The difference is significant because \u00a7 327 authorizes the trustee to employ an attorney \u2018with the court\u2019s approval.\u2019 \u201d Id. In Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 538-39, 124 S.Ct. 1023, 157 L.Ed.2d 1024 (2004), the Court succinctly stated: [W]e hold that \u00a7 330(a)(1) does not authorize compensation awards to debtors\u2019 attorneys from estate funds, unless they are employed as authorized by \u00a7 327. If the attorney is to be paid from estate funds under \u00a7 330(a)(1) in a Chapter 7 case, he must be employed by the trustee and approved by the court. This reading of the statute shows \u201cthat the revised \u00a7 330 means what it says.\u201d Weinschneider, 395 F.3d at 403; see also In re Oliver, 511 B.R. 556, 561-62 (Bankr.

Guardsmark argues that nothing in the rule explicitly prohibits off-duty solicitation and that employees would not reasonably so construe it, especially after the company clarified the rule\u2019s safe harbor. We disagree. To begin with, because Guardsmark failed to communicate the safe harbor clarification to all employees who had received the handbook, the Board properly focused on the rule\u2019s language.

Nothing in Green\u2019s EEOC charge related to incidents of harassment, nor did anything mention the dates on which they occurred.

Deere & Co., 556 F.3d 575, 583 (7th Cir.2009) (citing cases); Santomenno v. John Hancock Life Ins. Co., Civ. No. 2:10-ev-01655, 2013 WL 3864395, at *1 (D.N.J. July 24, 2013) (<HOLDING>). However, \u201cafter a person has entered into an holding that service provider was not a fiduciary with respect to revenue sharing because the total expenses associated with each investment option were fully disclosedholding that the phrases in connection with and associated with are synonymous with the terms with respect to with reference to and relating to which mean connected by reason of an established or discoverable relationholding the same with respect to an apartmentholding that when attorneys were acting as members of the firm with respect to the case in question section 504b1 applies to allow fee sharing with any member whether that membership is regular or sporadicholding that defendant was not a fiduciary with respect to a fixed fee that was set by an agreement negotiated at arms length & \n\nby private litigants, who lack the institutional constraints of prosecutors and grand juries. These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit. This case is, thus, distinguishable from those in which courts declined to dismiss claims recognized under New Jersey local law, even though out-of-state plaintiffs might have been unable to pursue such causes of action under their own state\u2019s local law. In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree. See Boyes, supra, 27 F.Supp.2d at 547-48 (<HOLDING>); Smith v. Alza Corp., 400 N.J.Super. 529, recognizing new jerseys interest in deterrence of tortious misconduct as a relevant factor in choice of law decisions applicable where two of defendants were new jersey residents from whom damages were sought for their negligent acts in new jerseyrecognizing israel had no interest in denying its citizens the substantive advantages of new jersey defamation law in new jersey residents claims for defamation published in new jerseyholding that a writ of execution under new jersey law is not an action against the consumerrecognizing that pennsylvania had no interest in denying its residents the greater damages available under new jersey consumer fraud statutes for claims against a new jersey sellerrecognizing that alabama had no interest in denying its residents the procedural and substantive advantages afforded under new jerseys product liability and consumer fraud statutes but not alabamas for claims against a new jersey manufacturer & \n\nso strict liability should be imposed. Again, defendants\u2019 argument is more persuasive. Massachusetts has not clearly recognized strict liability for the pumping of subterranean water, even if it results in damage to a plaintiffs land in its natural state. See Gamer, 346 Mass, at 620-21, 195 N.E.2d 65 (negligence); New York Cent. R. Co. v. Marinucci Bros. & Co., 337 Mass. 469, 472, 149 N.E.2d 680 (1958) (negligence). The strict liability-cases on which plaintiff relies have to do with the removal of lateral support by excavation, not by pumping. See Marinucci Bros., 337 Mass, at 472, 149 N.E.2d 680 (restating rule on strict liability for excavating and holding that excavator who withdraws mixture of silt and water can be held liable for negligence); Gilmore v. Driscoll, 122 Mass. 199 (<HOLDING>). As for the pumping of subsurface water, the holding that landowner who digs in such a way as to disturb natural state of neighboring land is strictly liableholding that permanent easement on land containing natural gas pipeline reduced value of directly encumbered land by 75holding that city may by ordinance require abutting landowner to repair sidewalk but that the abutting landowner is not liable in an action in tort for injuriesholding unconstitutional a zoning law that purported to give landowners who were not bound by any official duty but wejre free to withhold consent for selfish reasons or arbitrarily and could subject a neighboring landowner to their will or caprice authority to prevent a particular use on a neighbors landholding in case where railroad grant was an easement and not a right of way that title vested in abutting landowner once railroad abandoned land & \n\nbring an individual action under \u00a7 1132(a)(3). See 516 U.S. 489, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). Although Varity interpreted \u00a7 1132(a)(3) to authorize individual suits, its holding is not as broad as Wilson contends. The Supreme Court ruled that an individual can sue under \u00a7 1132(a)(3), but he or she must: (1) only seek equitable relief, and (2) have no more specific means of relief available. See Varity, 516 U.S. at 508-15, 116 S.Ct. 1065; Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, 127 F.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1997). Wilson\u2019s claim seeks damages in the amount of the rehabilitation expenses, not injunctive relief. Furthermore, the remedy for a claim that a plan participant\u2019s benefits were improperly denied is specifically provided for in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). See Turner, 127 F.3d at 200 (<HOLDING>). Thus, even if Wilson amended Count V, he holding that an individual who brings a lawsuit pursuant to 1132a1b to challenge a denial of disability benefits does not also have a right to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty under 1132a3holding that 1132a1b affords the plaintiff adequate relief for her benefits claim and a cause of action under 1132a3 is thus not appropriateholding that action to recover erisa benefits under the subject plan are legal in nature and that plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to trial by jury on any claim raised under 1132a1bholding plaintiff had no claim under 1132a3 because his grievance that benefits were denied is specifically addressed in 1132a1bholding that no ada violation was shown because the disabled were not denied benefits that were otherwise available & \n\nit appears Union County has not asserted a standing argument at all, but rather has attempted to invoke parens patriae authority, which in Latin means \u201cparent of his or her country,\u201d and refers to \u201cthe state in its capacity as provider of protection to those unable to care for themselves.\u201d Parens patriae, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1287 (10th ed. 2014), But it has long been settled that \u201ca state may act as parens patriae on behalf of its citizens. However, a county has no sovereign powers and cannot act as parens patriae, asserting the claims of its residents.\u201d Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Howard Cty. v. Kokomo City Plan Comm\u2019n, 263 Ind. 282, 295, 330 N.E.2d 92, 101 (1975) (internal citations omitted)- (emphasis added); see also Shoemaker v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs of Grant Cty., 36 Ind. 175, 183-84 (1871) (<HOLDING>). Union County is thus disqualified from holding that it was not the taxpayers responsibility to pursue the different tax units to which the illegally levied county tax was proportioned as the taxpayer was entitled to recover the full amount of the tax from the county the collecting entityholding a county and a road district had standing to sue state highway commission and county tax collector based on their interest in and control over the public roads of the countyholding that the county had no standing to sue the state to recover taxes illegally obtained from citizens unless the money belongs to the countyholding that both saline county and grant county had jurisdiction to try the appellant for murder where the actual killing occurred in one county but the acts requisite to the consummation of the murder and the subsequent disposal of the body occurred in the other countyholding before the apa definition of person was amended to include county that the board of county commission ers of dolores county could not sue the state agency that had ordered reappraisals of real property in dolores county in connection with valuation for ad valorem taxation because the board of county commissioners was not a person under the apa and did not otherwise have authority to sue under statute or constitution & \n\nas the starting date for calculating Gasser\u2019s delay in filing suit. Thus, although the court credited Gasser\u2019s testimony at least to the extent that this meeting took place, it failed to draw reasonable inferences in favor of Gasser about what took place during this encounter. Given Gasser\u2019s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome. See, e.g., Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia s.p.a., 944 F.2d 870, 878-79, 20 USPQ2d 1045, 1052 (Fed.Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>).

While federal courts often apply different state laws to federal claims, for example, the statute of limitations for a section 1983 claim differs depending on the state in which the claim arose, see Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261, 276, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985), the Court is un intiff stated a section 1983 claim against a supervisor at a state facility who placed plaintiff in danger by assigning her to work with an inmate sex offender who had a history of violent as saults against women; he subsequently-raped and kidnapped her); Wood v. Os-trander, 879 F.2d 583 (9th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiffs do not allege any affirmative holding that plaintiff had failed to state a claim for relief under section 1983holding that workers compensation statute barred suit of medical technologist who was allegedly raped and robbed in dormitory room which she rented from the hospital at which she was employedholding that plaintiff stated a section 1983 claim against police officers who after examining plaintiff and finding him in medical need canceled a 911 call to the paramedics dragged plaintiff from his porch where he was in public view into an empty house then locked the door and left him there aloneholding that plaintiff stated a section 1983 claim against a state police officer who caused a woman to be stranded in a highcrime area at night where she was subsequently rapedholding woman who alleged she was terminated for having an abortion stated a prima facie case for discrimination & \n\nchallenge out-sourcing decisions under statutes that were designed to promote that practice.

Subsequent to these decisions, as well as the Federal Circuit\u2019s decision in AFGE, Congress passed a specific provision authorizing certain federal employees to challenge the outcome of public-private competitions conducted under Circular A-76. See Pub.L. No. 108-375, \u00a7 326(a)(2), 118 Stat. 1811, 1848 (codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(2)(B)). There is no comparable provision authorizing the suit by plaintiff here. 23 .

Upon appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the matter with some instructions.

He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

The government does not have to show that the defendant\u2019s motive in committing the predicate act was to further the affairs of the enterprise. In fact, a defendant can commit a predicate act that is detrimental to the enterprise so long as the evidence establishes the requisite nexus between the predicate act and the enterprise.

Id. at 407-08, 347 A.2d 842. Nevertheless, we find Brohawn persuasive to the extent that it articulates one of many considerations that weigh on the question as to whether a declaratory judgment action is proper. We further find persuasive decisions arising from the courts of other jurisdictions that have refused to endorse the usurping of the jurisdiction of a court with concurrent jurisdiction through the failure to permit the matter to be resolved in its original forum.

In particular, I find that BPI Global has constitutional and statutory standing and would be an adequate class representative in this case. a. Article III Standing (\u201cInjury-in-Fact\u201d) Defendants\u2019 argument that BPI Global does not have constitutional standing ignores the fact that BPI Global is a direct investor in several of the funds for which it served as investment advisor. Defendants argue that because BPI Global was a mere advisor (through BPI Capital) to the mutual funds for which it purchased Sonus stock, it never suffered any injury itself. They rely upon a recent ease denying standing to an investment advisor. See In re Tyco Int\u2019l, Ltd., 236 F.R.D. 62, 73 (D.N.H.2006) (<HOLDING>). However, Tyco is inapplicable in this case holding that article iii standing is not a prerequisite to interventionrecognizing that while in a diversity case a federal court may not address the plaintiffs claim unless the plaintiff has standing to sue under state law the plaintiff must also meet article iii standing requirementsholding that bjecause plaintiff does not allege that it was directly injured by the defendants alleged misconduct it lacks article iii standing to sue on its clients behalfholding that the tcpa does not limit its protection to instances in which the plaintiff is charged within the context of article iii standingholding that article iii standing is necessary for intervention & \n\ncannot order that requested relief.

An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin.

The right to appear pro se is guaranteed as long as the defendant understands the nature of his choice. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525. In Pennsylvania, Rule of Criminal Procedure 121 sets out a framework for inquiry into a defendant\u2019s request for self-representation. Pa.R.Crim.P. 121. Where a defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently seeks to waive his right to counsel, the trial court must allow the individual to proceed pro se. See, El, supra; Commonwealth v. Starr, 541 Pa. 564, 664 A.2d 1326, 1335 (1995) (<HOLDING>).

The motion was denied and the defendant was sentenced. This appeal followed. Both the Federal and New Hampshire Constitutions guarantee a right to trial by jury. U.S. CONST, amends. VI, XIV; N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15. We consider the defendant\u2019s argument under the State Constitution first. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983). Because the Federal Constitution offers no greater protection than our State Constitution with regard to the rights asserted by the defendant, we need not undertake a separate federal analysis and cite federal law only to aid our analysis. See State v. Bousquet, 133 N.H. 485, 488 (1990); see also Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 298 (1930) (<HOLDING>). It is well established that \u201c[w]hen waiving a holding that decisions on whether to plead guilty or waive the right to a jury trial reside solely with the defendantrecognizing the right to waive a jury trialrecognizing that the sixth amendment guarantees a defendant the right to counsel and the right to waive counselholding that party did not waive right to trial by jury by requesting directed verdictholding that written jury waivers alone cannot validly waive a defendants right to a jury trial & \n\nthat the trial court erred in listing McCracken on the verdict form so as to permit the jury to apportion fault between him and Rowell. We agree. Appellants correctly argue that McCracken\u2019s act of committing suicide by jumping in front of a fifty-thousand pound tractor-trailer traveling at seventy miles per hour was an intentional, rather than a negligent, act. See Wyke v. Polk County Sch. Bd., 137 F.3d 1292, 1293 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming the trial court\u2019s refusal to -include the name of a teenage boy who committed suicide on the verdict form because the boy\u2019s suicide constituted an intentional act). Therefore, McCracken\u2019s name should not have been, and should not be, included on the verdict form. See id.; see also Stellas v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 702 So.2d 232, 233-34 (Fla.1997) (<HOLDING>); Jones v. Budget Rent-A-Car Sys., Inc., 723 holding that section 319s mandate that the employer is subrogated to the extent of compensation payable does not mean that the sole right to recover from the tortfeasor is in the employer rather the right of action against the tortfeasor remains in the injured employee and suit is to be commenced in his nameholding that a typographical error on the jury verdict form was harmless error because the trial court polled the jurors after the mistake was discovered to make sure that they understood the verdict that they had enteredholding that right of one joint tortfeasor to implead a second joint tortfeasor and have the jury apportion the damages according to their relative degrees of fault was not merely a procedural right but a substantive rightholding that it was error to permit the name of a nonparty intentional tortfeasors name to appear on the verdict form so as to permit the jury to apportion fault between the nonparty and the negligent tortfeasorholding that it would be inequitable to allow a town to deny a permit based on a new ordinance after the property owner was denied a permit three times and brought suit to determine the validity of the prior ordinance & \n\nto this litigation, and the instant motion to stay the trial of their claims would not have been ripe. (Chase Reply Mem. at 9-10.) A party may waive its right to arbitration by expressly indicating that it wishes to resolve its claims in court. Gilmore v. Shearson\/Amer.

The State Appellate Defender was appointed to represent defendant on appeal. II. ANALYSIS A. Posttrial Motions Defendant first contends that this cause must be remanded for further proceedings because the trial court failed to rule on his post-trial motion for recusal or his motion for a new trial. At the outset, we question whether defendant\u2019s pro se posttrial motions were properly before the trial court. The motions were filed at a time during which he was represented by counsel. It is well established that a defendant may not simultaneously proceed pro se and by counsel. See People v. Handy, 278 Ill. App. 3d 829, 836-37 (1996) (<HOLDING>); People v. Taggart, 233 Ill. App. 3d 530, 557 holding that a defendant proceeding pro se is bound by same rules as party represented by counsel and a court cannot allow pro se litigant lower standard of performanceholding that a defendant has a right to proceed pro se at trialholding that pro se pleadings from defendants who are represented by counsel in the pending criminal proceedings are unauthorizedholding that trial court erred in considering pro se motion for new trial filed when defendant was represented by counselholding defendants pro se motion to reduce sentence was not properly before the trial court when defendant was represented by counsel since defendant may not proceed both by counsel and pro se & \n\nargue that the arbitrator must make that decision. Because the court already determined that the arbitrator must decide whether this matter may proceed on a class or collective basis (doc. 62 at 8), defendants contend that the court also must hold that it is the arbitrator who must decide whether the effective vindication exception applies to invalidate the arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs never respond to this argument in their Reply. Doc. 68. Arguably, their failure to do so amounts to a waiver of this issue. See In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015, 1100-01 (10th Cir. 2014) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument because their reply brief was silent on an issue and made no attempt to rebut the respondents\u2019 argument); see also Cayetano-Castillo v.

Carrier Access Corp., 914 A.2d 636 (Del.Ch.2006) (<HOLDING>). If (counterfactually) King had brought his holding that a demand for jury trial should be denied if the issues in the original complaint and the amended complaint turn on the same matrix of factsholding that plaintiffs wishing to inspect books and records for purposes of pleading demand futility in an amended derivative complaint had a proper purposeholding that if a plaintiff cannot demonstrate he is able to amend his complaint in a manner which would survive dismissal opportunity to replead is rightfully deniedholding that the trial court properly struck the amended complaint when the plaintiff offered no reason to refute the trial courts finding that the new allegations in the amended complaint were based on facts the plaintiff had known since the beginning of the actionholding that plaintiff lacked a proper purpose for bringing a section 220 action because the federal judge in kenney had denied plaintiffs request to replead demand futility in an amended complaint & \n\nGovernment has waived any possibility of a \u00a7 9.51 defense by failing to raise it in its answer. We find this contention to be without merit. The Government did assert a law enforcement officer\u2019s privilege to use force in its motion to dismiss. Such an assertion suffices to raise the defense. See Terrell v. DeConna, 877 F.2d 1267, 1270 (5th Cir.1989) (\"The defendant ... raised the defense of issue preclusion by a motion to dismiss. That motion was sufficient to raise the defense, and there was therefore no waiver.\u201d). Further, the parties' joint pretrial order listed whether \"federal agents were privileged to use reasonable force in effectuating the detention of [Villafranca].\u201d Raising the defense there was also sufficient. See Vanhoy v. United States, 514 F.3d 447, 450-51 (5th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). 3 . There is some dispute about whether the holding that defendant does not waive an affirmative defense if defendant raises it at a pragmatically sufficient time such as summary judgment and the defendants failure raise the affirmative defense in its answer did not cause the plaintiff prejudiceholding that the government did not waive an affirmative defense not pleaded in the answer because it raised the defense at a pragmatically sufficient time by listing the defense in the joint pretrial orderholding that defendants failure to assert the defense in any pretrial motions did not waive defendants limitations defense because the assertion of a limitations defense in the answer preserved defendants right to raise the defense both during the first trial and before the secondholding that the district court properly allowed the defendant who asserted the disputed defense as a contested issue of law in the joint pretrial order to pursue the defense despite the defendants failure to comply with rule 8cholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded & \n\nso requires\u201d and that the amendment is subject to dis-allowance on the trial court\u2019s o t if allowing it would result in actual prejudice to the opposing party or for reasons of \u201cundue delay.\u201d GRE Ins. Group, 822 So.2d at 390. Undue delay can have two different meanings in a case. First, the trial court has discretion to deny an amendment to a pleading if allowing the amendment would unduly delay the trial. Horton v. Shelby Med. Ctr., 562 So.2d 127, 130 (Ala.1989). Second, an unexplained undue delay in filing an amendment when the party has had sufficient opportunity to discover the facts necessary to file the amendment earlier is also sufficient grounds upon which to deny the amendment. Stallings, 388 So.2d at 947; see also Rector v. Better Houses, Inc., 820 So.2d 75, 78 (Ala.2001)(<HOLDING>); Burkett, 607 So.2d at 141 (holding that the holding that the trial court properly struck the amended complaint when the plaintiff offered no reason to refute the trial courts finding that the new allegations in the amended complaint were based on facts the plaintiff had known since the beginning of the actionholding that since defendant failed to timely remove the original complaint which was removable based on federal question jurisdiction defendant thereby waived its right to file a subsequent removal even though the complaint was amended to add a new federal claim where the amendment to the complaint did not change the nature of the action so as to constitute a substantially new suit since the new allegations and claims were not substantially different from those in the original complaintholding that pleadings could not be amended where no evidence offered during trial was outside the issues in the original complaintholding that a demand for jury trial should be denied if the issues in the original complaint and the amended complaint turn on the same matrix of factsholding that the trial court did not exceed its discretion in striking the amended complaint where the plaintiffs had learned of the facts underlying the new allegations six months before they attempted to amend & \n\n408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), the United States Supreme Court also expressed the view that a witness\u2019 motive to lie does not render his or her testimony inadmissible: \u201cThe petitioner is quite correct in the contention that [the informant], perhaps even more than most informers, may have had motives to lie. But it does not follow that his testimony was untrue, nor does it follow that his testimony was constitutionally inadmissible. The established safeguards of the Anglo-American legal system leave the veracity of a witness to be tested by cross-examination, and the credibility of his testimony to be determined by a properly instructed jury.\u201d Id. at 311, 87 S.Ct. at 418.

Section 16-11-206, which governs the procedures at a revocation hearing, provides for certain advisements at revocation hearings: (1) At the first appearance of the probationer in court or at the commencement of the hearing, whichever is first in time, the court shall advise the probationer as provided in section 16-7-206 insofar as such matters are applicable .... (2) At or prior to the commencement of the hearing, the court shall advise the probationer of the charges against him and the possible penalties therefor and shall require the probationer to plead guilty or not guilty. \u00a7 16-11-206(1)-(2) (emphasis added). 116 Counsel may waive a defendant's statutory rights.

Mem. at 26). Individual issues, however, would predominate even before the damages stage. Because plaintiff will not be able to prove class-wide, company-wide discrimination with statistical evidence alone, a jury would need to consider each putative class member\u2019s claim individually to determine liability. To prove that an individual plaintiff suffered gender discrimination under disparate impact or disparate treatment theories of Title VII or the Equal Pay Act, an individualized inquiry into each putative plaintiffs circumstances would be necessary to determine whether employment actions taken toward a particular employee were based on gender or instead on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.

Clark alleges that he was qualified because he worked on an asphalt crew at APAC for well over a decade and because he acted as temporary foreman for two or three weeks out of the year for the years 1999-2004. APAC disputes that Clark\u2019s experience establishes that he was qualified to be an asphalt foreman. Instead, APAC declares that Clark was not qualified because he was unable to run the electronics on the APAC [paver] \u2014 a factor that Sam Head, the individual making the decision to fill the jobs, considered the single most important skill for the jobs. ([Head, Doc 20-2 at] 7-8, 17). Therefore, [Clark] cannot demonstrate that he was qualified for the job. See e.g., Greer [v. Birmingham Beverage Co., Inc.], 291 Fed.Appx. [948] at 945 [ (11th Cir.2008) ] (<HOLDING>). (Doc. 19 at 15-16). Head testified that Clark holding the plaintiff failed to make a prima facie case that the defendants failure to promote him was discriminatory where the plaintiff failed to that show he was qualified for the relevant positionholding to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination a plaintiff must show he 1holding that plaintiff could not establish prima facie case of discrimination where plaintiff failed to meet minimum qualifications for jobholding that the employers discharge of the plaintiff four months after the plaintiff filed a discrimination claim is insufficient to establish a prima facie case of retaliatory dischargeholding that plaintiff could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she was unable to present evidence that she was qualified for the position & \n\ndid have a prepetition legal interest in that case. At the time of bankruptcy, \u00a7 172 of the Internal Revenue Code gave the debtor a claim for a tax refund if certain conditions were met. It was the combination of the law and the conditions made legally relevant by the law that conferred on the debtor a prepetition legal interest: the claim for a refund. In that way, the Segal debtors\u2019 claim for a refund is similar to the prepetition accrual of a cause of action that results in a post-petition judgment in the debtor\u2019s favor. In such eases, the debtor\u2019s cause of action is a prepetition legal interest \u2014 \u25a0\u00a7 541(a)(1) property- \u2014 -that brings the postpetition judgment into the estate as proceeds under \u00a7 541(a)(6). See, e.g., Wieburg v. GTE Southwest Inc., 272 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Here, by contrast, Burgess suffered the crop holding that claims harming the debtor corporation that arose from prepetition conduct become property of the estate under 11 usc 541a1holding that causes of action for age and sex discrimination that arose prepetition were property of the bankruptcy estateholding that to make out the fourth element of a prima facie case of sex discrimination plaintiff must prove that males remained in similar positions and similarly for age discrimination that she was otherwise discharged because of her ageholding lost future wages recovered pursuant to a prepetition cause of action are property of the estateholding age discrimination claim barred & \n\nmanslaughter conviction where teenager died in an automobile accident after leaving an underage drinking party that the defendant knowingly permitted her minor daughter to host); Commonwealth v.

It was reasonable for the jury to infer that, had Appellant properly performed his duties, the accident would not have occurred. The cases relied upon by Appellant in support of his sufficiency challenge are inapposite, as they involve factual circumstances where the defendant\u2019s conduct was more remote and attenuated. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Moyer, 436 Pa.Super. 442, 648 A.2d 42, 46 (1994) (<HOLDING>); Commonwealth v. Colvin, 340 Pa.Super. 278, holding commonwealth did not establish a prima facie case of involuntary manslaughter after a jet ski crashed into defendants boat because there was no evidence that the defendant could have avoided the accidentholding that the plaintiff made a prima facie case even though there was no evidence of causal connection other than the fact that the plaintiff was fired after bringing a lawsuitholding that plaintiff could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she was unable to present evidence that she was qualified for the positionholding that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiffs protected conductholding to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination a plaintiff must show he 1 & \n\nage at the time (Gibbs Dep. at 18), it is possible that he was merely relating his own experiences about his ability to heal post-injury. See MacDonald v. United Parcel Serv., 430 Fed.Appx. 453, 460 (6th Cir.2011) (\u201cMacDonald testified that Bowen told him to \u2018move your old ass\u2019 during the contentious events of January 25, 2007, but Bowen is only three years younger than MacDonald, so even viewed in the light most favorable to MacDonald, this statement does little for him.\u201d). And the comment was accompanied by Ilardi\u2019s advice that exercise would be good for Gibbs\u2019 healing. (Id. at 37.) In this context, the comment does not require the conclusion that Ilardi harbored discriminatory feelings towards workers over fifty. Cf. Phelps v. Yale Sec., Inc., 986 F.2d 1020, 1025-26 (6th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). The same does not hold true for the comment holding that the defendants comment that the plaintiffs upcoming fiftyfifth birthday was a cause for concern was too ambiguous to give rise to an inference of age discrimination and therefore was not direct evidenceholding that a prima facie case for discrimination requires the plaintiff to show that 1 he belongs to the protected age group 2 his job performance was satisfactory 3 adverse employment action was taken against him in 4 circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination holding that the hiring and firing of an employee by the same actor within a period of a few years gives rise to an inference that age discrimination was not the motive behind the terminationholding that a statement of fact relating to the plaintiffs age was not direct evidence of age discrimination because the relevance of the comment is provided by inferenceholding in age discrimination case that plaintiffs dismissal did not give rise to an inference of discrimination when job was subsequently offered to an older individual & \n\nlot of progress, and she- deserved the nomination.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 108.) Moreover, \u25a0 Garcia acknowledges that she was the only candidate Gold nominated for promotion in 2010. (See id. \u00b6 13.) Construing the inconsistencies and facts in Garcia\u2019s favor, I find that Garcia\u2019s assertion that Gold essentially did not work hard enough on her nomination is unpersuasive. In addition, there is also no basis to conclude that the committee\u2019s stated reason not to promote Garcia in 2010 was a pretext for discrimination. In support, Garcia merely states that the committee was composed of almost entirely white men; however, this fact alone does not establish pretext. See Holdmeyer v. Veneman, 321 F.Supp.2d 374, 382 (D. Conn. 2004), aff'd sub nom., Holdmeyer v. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 146 Fed.Appx. 535 (2d Cir. 2005) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, the committee promoted at least one holding that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to gender discrimination and retaliation claims where she had only asserted discrimination based on race and disability in her eeoc complaintholding that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiffs protected conductholding that a plaintiff had not established a prima facie case of race discrimination because she failed to show valid comparators and presented no other circumstantial evidence of discriminationrecognizing that stray remarks are insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination and concluding that a comment by the decisionmaker that he selected a candidate for a promotion because the candidate was a bright intelligent knowledgeable young man was a stray remark that did not raise an inference of age discriminationholding plaintiff failed to raise inference of discrimination where only evidence plaintiff adduced was fact that decisionmaker was different race & \n\nbut even if he is correct, AT & T would still be able to terminate his employment based on a mistaken application of the internal policy, if AT & T is correct that his employment was unconditionally at-will. See Smith v. Union Labor Life Ins. Co., 620 A.2d 265, 269-70 (D.C.1993) (affirming summary judgment to defendant employer where the plaintiff claims that she was terminated for violating a policy she in fact followed because the discharge violated no employment contract and was not contrary to public policy); Alibalogun v. First Coast Sec. Sols., Inc., 67 F.Supp.3d 211, 218 (D.D.C.2014) (complaint \"merely\u201d alleging termination due to \"a false reason,\u201d without more, is inadequate to support a claim of wrongful termination); cf. Pope v. Romac Intern., 829 A.2d 945, 947 (D.C.2003) (<HOLDING>). 3 . AT & T has also moved for sanctions, holding that if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of age discrimination the employer must show that the discharge was based on reasonable factors other than age and if the employer meets that burden the plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the dischargeholding that where the immediate cause or motivating factor of a discharge is the employees assertion of statutory rights the discharge is discriminatory under section 215a3 whether or not grounds for other discharge existholding the pro se plaintiff has no breach of contract or wrongful discharge claim against defendant employer where the employer wrongfully characterized her discharge as for cause but remanding to trial court to consider whether the pro se plaintiff suffered some other compensable injury if the employer as alleged intentionally mischaracterized the plaintiffs discharge in order to reduce its unemployment contributionsholding that an employee has no right of action against an employer for wrongful discharge where no clear mandate of public policy is violated therebyrecognizing cause of action for wrongful discharge & \n\nstates, in pertinent part: \u201cAffirmed by Memorandum. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. The appellant, Addie Lee Thomas, appeals her conviction and her subsequent sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the murder of her common law husband. Thomas raised two issues on appeal. Thomas first contends that the trial court committed reversible error by not allowing a Batson hearing following the state\u2019s use of nine of its ten peremptory strikes against black members of the venire. The original veni-re pool consisted of 47% black members and the final empaneled jury was 50% black. The trial court did not make a clearly erroneous ruling by finding that a prima facie case of discrimination was not established against the state. See Harrell v. State, 571 So.2d 1270 (Ala.1990) (<HOLDING>).\u201d In Harrell v. State, 555 So.2d 263 (Ala. holding that blacks who were not subjected to racial discrimination had standing under title vii to sue over discrimination against other blacksholding that while proper statistical evidence can be the most important vehicle for showing class discrimination the plaintiff failed to compare the percentage of blacks hired for given jobs with the percentage of blacks qualified for those positions and it was not sufficient to merely show that black managers formed a smaller percentage of the manager pool than did managers of other racesholding that the prosecutors use of four of his five peremptory strikes to remove blacks was sufficient to establish a prima facie caseholding that without more the mere fact that the prosecutor used a high number of strikes to remove women from the venire is insufficient to establish a prima facie caseholding that a prima facie case of discrimination is not established merely by the number of peremptory strikes against blacks in cases where the percentage of blacks on the empaneled jury is higher than the percentage of the venire pool & \n\nmade by individuals with substantial influence over plaintiff's employment); Crader v. Concordia College, 724 F.Supp. 558, 564 (N.D.Ill.1989) (if deci-sonmaker's sources of information about plaintiff are \"polluted by racial bias, that might be enough to poison the well\u201d).

But see Haskell v. Kaman Corp., 743 F.2d 113, 120 (2d Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>). 5 . The Bank relies heavily on Mazzella v. holding that comments relating to age made some three to fifteen or more years prior to plaintiffs discharge were not relevant to show that he was fired because of his ageholding that a statement of fact relating to the plaintiffs age was not direct evidence of age discrimination because the relevance of the comment is provided by inferenceholding that adea plaintiff had failed to make a prima facie case of age discrimination when he was replaced by someone only two years younger and within the protected age group and there was no other evidence of age discriminatory motiveholding that supervisors reactions to comments did not constitute direct evidence of age discrimination where comments were made six months prior to plaintiffs discharge and were unconnected to the discharge decisionholding that if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of age discrimination the employer must show that the discharge was based on reasonable factors other than age and if the employer meets that burden the plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the discharge & \n\nannuities, see D.C.Code \u00a7 5-716 (2012 Repl.). The linkage between \"performance of duty\u201d in D.C.Code \u00a7 1-612.030 and the Disability Act is further supported by the apparent application of the procedural provision in D.C.Code \u00a7 5-708.01 (addressing \"processing of claims of injuries allegedly sustained within the performance of duty\u201d) to claims for nonchargeable sick leave under D.C.Code \u00a7 1-612.03(j). See, e.g., Smallwood, 956 A.2d at 707-08; Franchak, 932 A.2d at 1089. 15 .

We note the inconsistency of the phrases \u201cprima facie case\u201d and \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d appearing in the same burden of proof. However, this is the United States Supreme Court's language. Interestingly, it is only used by the federal courts in discussing summary judgment; i.e., presumptions that arise from establishing a prima facie case of retaliation. Even the federal courts that have attempted to instruct a jury on the McDonnell Douglas analysis do not instruct on prima facie case. 6 . In Sanghvi v. City of Claremont, 328 F.3d 532 (9th Cir.2003), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that it was error to instruct the jury on the technical elements of the McDonnell Douglas burden shifting ana .3d 207, 221-222 (3rd Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1147, 121 S.Ct. 1086, holding that although a jury instruction that included the phrase prima facie case and referred to defendants burden of production created a distinct risk of confusing the jury in certain instances it would be appropriate to instruct the jury on the elements of a prima facie caseholding that although it is proper to instruct the jury that it may consider whether the factual predicates necessary to establish the prima facie case have been shown it is error to instruct the jury on the mcdonnell douglas burden shifting schemeholding that the district courts failure to instruct the jury as to the proper standard of proof constituted plain errorholding that it was improper for the trial court to instruct the jury that it could not consider the states failure to videotape the defendantholding that the failure to properly instruct the jury on the burden of proof required a new trial & \n\nto violence and to a breach of the peace.

Here, Penn invokes the second cause of action articulated by the Mauck court, namely, that Kidder\u2019s comment constituted insulting words which tend to violence and to a breach of the peace. Kidder\u2019s comment, however, while a crude sexual remark, was neither a vituperative epithet nor traditional racial slur of the type which the Supreme Court of Appeals have held to be actionable under section 55-7-2.

See Al-Harbi v. INS, 242 F.3d 882, 888 (9th Cir.2001). As we have already held that the BIA did not err in holding that the particular social group identified by the Petitioners is insufficient to merit asylum protection, we also hold that Petitioners fail to present a prima facie case for withholding of removal. See Farah v. Ashcroft, 348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen holding that if an applicant fails to meet the standard for asylum he a fortiori fails to meet the requirements for withholding of removal and relief under the catholding that the standard for withholding of removal is more demanding than the standard for asylumholding that an applicant who fails to satisfy the lower standard of proof for asylum necessarily fails to satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removalrecognizing that a withholding of removal claim necessarily fails if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the factual predicate for the claims is the sameholding that an alien who has failed the wellfounded fear test for asylum will necessarily fail the more stringent more likely than not test for withholding of removal & \n\nPressure is secondary when its target is some employer other than the one engaged in a labor dispute with the union applying the pressure. To make this distinction, courts inquire into the \u201cobject\u201d of a union\u2019s activity. If \u201cthe object of the union\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, is to bring indirect pressure on the primary employer by involving neutral or secondary employers in the dispute, the conduct is secondary and prohibited.\u201d Abreen Corp. v. Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union, 709 F.2d 748, 754-55 (1st Cir.1983). A plaintiff need not prove that the union\u2019s sole or primary object is to employ secondary pressure, only that one of its objects is the use of secondary pressure. See Pye v. Teamsters Local Union No. 122, 61 F.3d 1013, 1023 (1st Cir.1995); see also Abreen Corp., 709 F.2d at 755 (<HOLDING>). Intent, therefore, is the first necessary holding that plain tiff must show that the secondary pressure is not merely incidental to the pressure imposed on the primary employerholding that new evidence must be evidence that is not merely cumulativeholding that government must merely show that defendant knew that it was a bank that he intended to influenceholding that if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of age discrimination the employer must show that the discharge was based on reasonable factors other than age and if the employer meets that burden the plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the dischargeholding a parsonage taxable where the use of the property to accomplish religious purposes was only incidental or secondary to the primary purpose of providing a residence for the pastor and his family & \n\n"}

Relying on its decision in Salyer v. Patrick, 874 F. 2d 374 (CA6 1989), the Court of Appeals affirmed. I would grant certiorari to address petitioner\u2019s challenge to that ruling. In Salyer, the Sixth Circuit held that, \u201cdue to their quasiprosecutorial function in the initiation of child abuse proceedings,\u201d social workers are absolutely immune from liability for filing juvenile abuse petitions. Id., at 378. Other courts addressing the question have agreed that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 in some instances, depending on their conduct and the terms of the state laws pursuant to which they acted. See, e. g., Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dept. of Social Servs., 812 F. 2d 1154, 1157 (CA9) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 829 (1987); Vosburg holding that social services attorneys were entitled to absolute immunity for actions related to the prosecution of child neglect and delinquency proceedingsholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity when prosecuting child delinquency petitionsholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity in performing quasiprosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuit of child dependency proceedingsholding that child social workers are entitled to absolute immunity for their actions on behalf of the state in preparing for initiating and prosecuting dependency hearings as well as the formulation and presentation of recommendations to the court in the course of such proceedings & \n\nover other attorneys, settled tort cases only pursuant to directives he received from an internal management committee, and never participated in any forum wherein departmental policy was discussed and\/or established. The defendants\u2019 reliance on a string of cases holding that municipal attorneys in positions similar to Selkirk\u2019s were not protected by Elrod and Branti, is irrelevant and misplaced. The very essence of the following cases required an examination of the duties of each plaintiff to ascertain whether his position entailed \u201cpolicymak-ing\u201d responsibility or required political fealty to effectively perform. The Court need not undertake such an analysis here because the Defendants have already done so and concluded to the contrary. See Livas v. Petka, 711 F.2d 798 (7th Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); Mummau v. Ranck, 687 F.2d 9 (3rd Cir. 1982) holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding absolute immunity protects prosecutor from liability for withholding exculpatory evidence from grand juryholding that nasd disciplinary officers are entitled to absolute immunity from further prosecution for civil liability for them actions taken within the outer scope of them official dutiesholding in dicta that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute loyalty from his assistants and could terminate them for political reasons & \n\n96 S.Ct. 984. However, \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate\u2019s preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immunity.\u201d Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606. A defendant pleading absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question. Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 487, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991). The defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity prevails only in part. They are correct that they have absolute immunity for offering the tape recording into evidence at the hearing because in doing so they were functioning as advocates. See Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. 984 (<HOLDING>); see also Butz, 438 U.S. at 516-517, 98 S.Ct. holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from 1983 suits for initiating a prosecution and presenting the case at trialholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding prosecutors immune from civil suits for initiating prosecutions and presenting casesholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nKentucky Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, KRS 342.690(1) provides: If an employer secures payment of compensation as required by this chapter, the liability of such employer under this chapter shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death. KRS 342.690(1) (emphasis added). The statute and Kentucky case law interpreting the statute make it clear that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy where a covered employee is injured by her employer\u2019s negligent actions. See, e.g., Shamrock Coal Co., Inc. v. Maricle, 5 S.W.3d 130 (Ky.1999) (<HOLDING>); Hardin v. Action Graphics, Inc., 57 S.W.3d holding that the exclusivity of workers compensation is an affirmative statutory defense which must be timely raised or it is waivedholding that coal workers claim that mine owner was negligent careless and reckless in its mining operations was barred under exclusivity provision of workers compensation actholding that exclusivity provision of workers compensation act barred wifes loss of consortium claimholding that an injured workers initial election to seek state compensation does not implicate the exclusivity provision to preclude the worker from later seeking compensation under the longshore actholding that the coemployee immunity provision in workers compensation law was constitutional & \n\nnot to place the tapes in the investigation file, depends upon the function he was performing at the time the conduct occurred. He is absolutely immune from liability for damages if he was gathering evidence to present to the trier of fact. See Ybarra, 723 F.2d at 679. Bogan and Ingram would be protected only by qualified immunity, however, if they were conducting an investigation to determine whether probable cause existed to arrest Broam and Manning. See, e.g., Powers v. Coe, 728 F.2d 97, 103 (2d Cir.1984) (determining that, \u201cwhen a prosecutor engages in or authorizes and directs illegal wiretaps\u201d and \u201cthe wiretapping is ... investigative in nature,\u201d the prosecutors are only \u201centitled to qualified, rather than absolute, immunity\u201d); Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515, 524 (9th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>); Guerro v. Mulhearn, 498 F.2d 1249, 1255-56 holding officers engaged in search entitled to immunityholding that a judge was not entitled to absolute immunity for firing an employeeholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that when prosecutors joined in implementing the wiretap they engaged in an act that was ordinarily related to police activity and were not entitled to absolute immunityholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nit did not reach the question of immunity. Given the conclusions we have reached, however, it is necessary for us to do so. Under \u00a7 820.2, a public employee cannot be held liable for any injury resulting from \u201chis act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.\u201d The City correctly asserts that \u00a7 820.2 applies to county social workers engaged in investigating allegations of child abuse, and extends to other public employees whom those social workers \u201creasonably enlist to assist in the investigation.\u201d Newton v. County of Napa, 217 Cal.App.3d 1551, 266 Cal.Rptr. 682, 687 (Cal.App.1990); Alicia T. v. County of Los Angeles, 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 271 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519-20 (Cal.App.1990) (<HOLDING>). This immunity provides complete protection holding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed in the employees favor and any doubt in its construction is thus resolved in favor of the employeeholding that social workers immunity is designed to protect the continu ing exercise of discretion in favor of the protection of minor childrenholding that in its review of the irs exercise of discretion the court is limited to a review of the administrative recordholding that under mayfield the exercise of discretion based on a mistaken premise of law can be a failure to properly exercise discretion & \n\napparent on the statute\u2019s face and the question of their enforcement duties, if any, was not considered in the decision declaring the statutes unconstitutional, nor were the merits of the proposition otherwise litigated. Moreover, where, as here, the state defendants include members of the judiciary who \u201cenjoy absolute immunity from damages liability for acts performed in their judicial eapaeitie[s],\u201d Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 735, 100 S.Ct. at 1976, it is particularly important to give careful consideration as to whether liability is properly based upon the exercise of their enforcement authority since imposition of a fees award might be erroneously premised upon acts or omissions as to which the defendants are immune. See id. at 738, 100 S.Ct. at 1977 (<HOLDING>). Unquestionably, with respect to the holding trial court had no authority to award attorneys fees when arbitrator had stated he would not award attorneys feesholding that a district court may award attorneys fees while the merits are on appealholding merely that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of attorneys feesholding that an award of attorneys fees under supreme court rule 38 precursor to rule 222 did not preempt an award of attorneys fees to which one is otherwise entitled and thus appellant could seek an award of attorneys fees pursuant to section 1577300 which permits an award of fees for a party prevailing in an action against a state agencyholding district jourts award of attorneys fees was erroneous since court relied upon a theory of liability under which defendants had immunity & \n\nclaims. This immunity applies to the section 1983 claims. Individual immunity is not necessary for the RLUIPA claims. RLUIPA provides a cause of action against \u201cgovernments\u201d and does not appear to allow causes of action against individuals. (A section 1983 claim' against an individual could be based upon a denial of such a statutory right (see Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980)), but such a claim would be a section 1983 claim, not an individual RLUIPA claim.) In any event, to the extent Plaintiffs assert or can assert a claim against individual defendants in their personal capacities specifically under RLUIPA, the Court would find the same immunity and such claims are dismissed. See Mishler v. Clift, 191 F.3d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) (citing Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, holding that as a general rule interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity governmental immunity public official immunity statutory immunity or any other type of immunity are not appealable under the maryland collateral order doctrineholding that prosecutors have absolute immunityholding trial court improperly granted dismissal on ground of immunity because the defendant had qualified statutory immunity rather than absolute immunityholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitrecognizing that absolute immunity is immunity from charges of either constitutional or statutory violations & \n\nwould in itself be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to criminal or civil statutes.\u201d Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 312-13, 93 S.Ct. 2018, 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973) (citation omitted). Before defendants in the instant case can invoke legislative immunity, they have the burden of establishing both of the following: (1) that the acts giving rise to the harm alleged in the complaint were undertaken when defendants were acting in their legislative capacities under the functional test set forth in Bogan; and (2) that the particular relief sought would enjoin defendants in their legislative capacities, and not in some other capacity in which they would not be entitled to legislative immunity. See State Emp., 494 F.3d at 89; see also Canary v. Osborn, 211 F.3d 324, 328 (6th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Here, Defendants argue that by issuing the holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the burden is on the plaintiffholding that city council is entitled to absolute legislative immunity from claim under the age discrimination in employment actholding that the burden is on defendant as the party invoking removal jurisdiction to establish the existence of a sufficient amount in controversyholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nand ministerial acts in its application of the qualified public official immunity doctrine. See, e.g., Parker v. State, 337 Md. 271, 284, 653 A.2d 436, 442 (1995) (noting that \u201cthe Court has distinguished between the qualified and narrower immunity for discretionary acts generally accorded to public officials, and absolute judicial immunity, which ... applies [to judges] regardless of the nature of the tort\u201d (emphasis added)); Mandel, 320 Md. at 110, 576 A.2d at 769 (recognizing that \u201c \u2018the Maryland cases seem to indicate that discretionary action [of officials] will be protected only in the absence of malice\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Eliason v.

In the context of public official immunity, holding that the statute incorporated all the rights and obligations of the contract emphasis addedholding that individuals acting in a legislative capacity at a regional level are entitled to absolute immunityholding that states and state officials acting in their official capacity are not persons under 1983holding that in maryland governmental immunity is extended to all nonmalicious acts of public officials when acting in a discretionary capacity emphasis added quoting duncan 260 md at 104 271 a2d at 550holding that as a general rule interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity governmental immunity public official immunity statutory immunity or any other type of immunity are not appealable under the maryland collateral order doctrine & \n\na claim for or the receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits or other payments arising from events unrelated to the ior injury is inadmissible because it is \u201cclearly irrelevant to the issues being tried.\u201d Leslie v. Higgason, 779 So.2d 470, 470 (Fla. 2d DCA 2000). Evidence concerning a \u201c[plaintiffs] previous injury\u201d may, however, be relevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s liability or the amount of damages due. Id. There are also circumstances where evidence specifically concerning litigation or claims by a plaintiff for a prior injury will be considered relevant to matters at issue and therefore admissible. Thus, \u201ca plaintiff may properly be questioned about prior lawsuits or claims for injuries similar to those complained of in the present laws 2d 805, 806-07 (Fla. 5th DCA 2002) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, evidence relating to a subsequent holding that trial court erred in excluding from evidence the application for social security benefits that the plaintiff made eight months prior to the accident at issue in which he described in detail his inability to work which was probative in establishing the plaintiffs condition prior to the accident and stating that since the plaintiff was denied social security benefits there was no collateral sourceholding that the claims court has no jurisdiction under the tucker act over claims to social security benefitsholding that an evidentiary hearing is not required prior to the termination of social security disability benefitsholding that offset for social security retirement benefits does not include federal disability benefits and stating that there was no legislative intent to embody the entire subchapter of the social security act dealing with both disability benefits and old age benefitsholding that use of social security benefits satisfied child support obligation & \n\nprohibition. Finally, the undisputed evidence demonstrates that it was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d for Jones to believe that he was acting lawfully. Jennings, 2005 WL 2043945, at *5. In reviewing the district court\u2019s grant of immunity on JMOL, I assume arguendo that the evidence is taken in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. A. Effect of the Jury\u2019s Verdict Two thoughts should be removed from the picture at the outset. First, Jones did not break Jennings\u2019 ankle with reckless or callous indifference to Jennings\u2019 federal rights. Second, he did not knowingly violate the law. The jury verdict cannot, as a matter of law, be taken to establish these points because they were not elements of the claim that went to the jury. There was no basis for punitive damages here. S 92) (<HOLDING>). The majority reasons that the jury, by its holding that once probable cause is established officer is not required to investigate furtherholding that although jury found officer not to have had probable cause for arrest officer was entitled to immunity because law was not clearly established as to circumstances in which officer found himselfholding that qualified immunity applies only if an officer had arguable probable cause to arrestholding that in deciding whether officers are entitled to qualified immunity it is not only the evidence of clearly established law that is for the court but also whether a reasonable officer could have believed that his or her conduct was lawful in light of the information the officer hadholding that an officer applying for a warrant without probable cause may be entitled to qualified immunity but is not entitled to absolute immunity & \n\nfor the State. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 430 94 (\u201cWe can see no substantial difference between the function of the agency attorney in presenting evidence in an agency hearing and the function of the prosecutor who brings evidence before a court.\u201d). Moreover, the absolute immunity the defendants enjoy for offering the composite tape into evidence is not defeated by Cig-netti\u2019s allegations that they did so maliciously or in bad-faith because they knew or should have known that the composite tape was fabricated. See e.g. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 409, 96 S.Ct. 984 (concluding that absolute prosecutorial immunity precluded a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that a prosecutor had knowingly used perjured testimony and deliberately suppressed exculpatory material at trial); Burns, 500 U.S. at 478, 111 S.Ct. 1934 (<HOLDING>); see also Kulwicki v. Dawson, 969 F.2d 1454, holding that an officer applying for a warrant without probable cause may be entitled to qualified immunity but is not entitled to absolute immunityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding prosecutor had absolute immunity for claim for eliciting misleading testimony in a probable cause hearingholding that prosecutor retained absolute immunity despite allegations of witness intimidation in attempt to suppress testimonyholding that a prosecutor accused of knowingly presenting false testimony at trial is protected by absolute immunity & \n\ngovernment has breached the clear terms of the agreement. See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1034-35; Thompson, 25 F.3d at 1562-63; Rowe, 676 F.2d at 528. Accordingly, to succeed on her immunity claim, Kozak must demonstrate that an agreement was reached with the government under the terms of which the government would refrain from prosecuting her in exchange for her cooperation. In order to create a valid contract, the parties must come to a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d Restatement (Second) Of Contracts \u00a7 17 comment c (1981). Thus, in the parlance of contract law, to succeed on her transactional immunity claim, Kozak must demonstrate at least a meeting of the minds that the government would refrain from prosecuting her in exchange for her cooperation in the investigation. See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1034 (<HOLDING>); United States v. Carrillo, 709 F.2d 35, 36 holding that a party seeking to compel arbitration must establish the existence of an arbitration agreement and show that the claims raised fall within the scope of that agreementholding failure to establish terms of an oral loan agreement precluded the existence of a breach of contract claimholding that defendant must demonstrate meeting of the minds in order to establish existence of immunity agreementholding that in order to establish liability under the ada the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant was an employer within the meaning of the statuteholding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunity & \n\nof such an evaluation. Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 17a-582(e). The court then considers both reports as well as any other evidence, including witness testimony, provided by the parties.

Therefore, the defendants are entitled to holding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitholding that judges have immunity from suit for judicial actsholding that regardless of whether the deferred adjudication was part of a plea bargain recommended by the prosecution imposed by the trial court without objection by the appellant or granted under other circumstances once the trial court proceeds to adjudication it is restricted in the sentence it imposes only by the relevant statutory limitsholding that psychiatrists who upon appointment by a court recommended the release of a man acquitted of a crime by reason of mental disease or defect enjoyed judicial immunity from suit for damages by relatives of a woman later killed by the man releasedholding that in the absence of a statute providing immunity the defense of sovereign immunity is not available to a municipal corporation in an action for damages alleged to be caused by the tortious conduct of the municipality & \n\nMr. Belcher testified that he was able to remove the radio from the van. R.59, Ex. 2 at 50. 6 . Indiana courts have defined false imprisonment as \"the unlawful restraint upon one's freedom of movement or the deprivation of one\u2019s liberty without consent.\u201d Miller v. City of Anderson, 777 N.E.2d 1100, 1104 (Ind.Ct.App.2002). Indiana courts have stated also that \"[a] defendant may be liable for false arrest when he or she arrests the plaintiff[s] in the absence of probable cause to do so.\u201d Id. The circumstances of this procedural due process claim do not involve false arrest or false imprisonment under Indiana tort law. Therefore, these exceptions to the law enforcement immunity provision do not apply. 7 . See, e.g., East Chicago Police Dep\u2019t v. Bynum, 826 N.E.2d 22, 26 (Ind.Ct.App.2005) (<HOLDING>); City of Hammond v. Reffitt, 789 N.E.2d 998, holding police officers were entitled to immunity where the officers decided not to arrest an intoxicated driver who subsequently died of hypothermia in his vehicleholding that police officers were not entitled to immunity under the itca law enforcement immunity provision where the officers violated their statutory duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all individuals while acting within the scope of their employmentholding officers engaged in search entitled to immunityholding that even if the plaintiff had asserted a cause of action under the virginia wrongful death act against the city police officers the police officers would be entitled to sovereign immunityholding that officers were entitled to qualified immunity where defendant officers could have reasonably believed that they were given sufficient third party consent to search & \n\ncourts had held that \u201cabsolute immunity was conferred upon judges acting within their lawful powers, even where the actions allegedly involved serious misconduct,\u201d and that this principle \u201cwas directly imported into the law of the United States as the common-law basis for judicial immunity.\u201d This common law principle is most often used to immunize a judge from liability in civil litigation, but it has also been used to support the proposition that a judge cannot be compelled to testify about his or her thought process in making a decision in a case. See State v. Lewis, 656 So.2d 1248 (Fla.1994) (stating that a judge may not be examined as to his or her thought process in making a decision); Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles v. Marks, 898 So.2d 1063 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005) (<HOLDING>). We can draw the same analogy to the holding order of contempt sentence without statutory opportunity for appeal was in error but nevertheless involved a judicial act subject to judicial immunityrecognizing that absolute judicial immunity is not grounded in any special esteem for those who perform judicial functions and certainly not from a desire to shield abuses of office but because any lesser degree of immunity could impair the judicial process itselfholding that individuals acting in a legislative capacity at a regional level are entitled to absolute immunityholding that a hearing officer acting in a judicial capacity was entitled to claim judicial immunity and could not be compelled to give testimony about his mental process in deciding a caserecognizing judicial immunity for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction & \n\nhis parents for injuries for which there is available homeowners insurance coverage as a logical, but limited, extension of our prior holdings in Syllabus point 2 of Lee v.

The court concluded that the information was irrele vant and its minimal probative value outweighed by its potential for prejudice. Id. at 464-65. See also Zeng Liu, 207 F.Supp.2d at 193 (denying defendant\u2019s request to discover information relating to plaintiffs immigration status because such information is both irrelevant and the need for its disclosure outweighed by the risk of injury to the plaintiffs, even if the parties were to enter into a confidentiality agreement); Cabrera, 695 N.W.2d at 81 (<HOLDING>). In Galaviz-Zamora, the court denied discovery holding that plaintiffs social security numbers are not relevant to determining liability for unpaid wages in a suit under the flsa and state lawholding under flsaholding that plaintiffs were injured by defendants collection and publication of highly sensitive personal information including credit card numbers social security numbers financial account numbers and information regarding plaintiffs personal issues including sexuality mental illness alcoholism incest rape and domestic violenceholding that social security benefits should not be set off from adea lost wages awardholding that the flsa does not preempt a state law contractual claim that seeks to recover wages for time that is compensable under the contract but not under the flsa & \n\nmade for the benefit prior to the execution of the settlement agreement. Hence, Comiskey\u2019s waiver of future medical and rehabilitation workmen\u2019s compensation benefits precludes his recovery of the claim he asserts here.\u201d Id. In this case, Plaintiff twice requested approval for alternative physician care from Drs. Fulk-erson and Swan and was twice denied, all prior to entering into a settlement agreement. Unlike the home spa in Comiskey, therefore, Plaintiffs evidence \u2014 viewed in the light most favorable to her as the non-moving party and drawing all reasonable inferences in her favor \u2014 shows the alternative care requested was not \u201cpermissible under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d See Am. Fam. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Centura Health-St. Anthony Cent. Hosp., 46 P.3d 490, 493 (Colo.Ct.App.2002) (<HOLDING>).

A suit seeking a writ of habeas corpus, although admittedly somewhat of a hybrid, is considered civil in nature. See Santana v. United States, 98 F.3d 752, 754 (3d Cir.1996). Accordingly, by operation of \u00a7 76(a), as of October 1, 1991 the District Court of the Virgin Islands was divested of jurisdiction to consider petitions for writs of habeas corpus under territorial habeas corpus law. We have previously held that to the extent that Virgin Islands Code provisions vest jurisdiction in the District Court, they have been implicitly repealed. See Tamarind Resort Assocs. v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 138 F.3d 107, 114 (3d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>); Moravian Sch.

Claim Seven: Post-conviction Proceedings Violated Petitioner\u2019s Due Process And Equal Protection Rights In his seventh claim, petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance of his post-conviction appeal violated his right to equal protection and due process. He complains that the State Supreme Court failed to give a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of his Massiah claims. The court concludes that this claim alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas relief, because petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware State Courts\u2019 analysis in a state collateral proceeding. See Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir.1998)(<HOLDING>)(emphasis in original); see also Lambert v. holding habeas petitioners may show cause for such default in specific circumstances in states that require petitioners to raise iatc claims in initial state habeas proceedings rather than on direct appealholding that the federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioners conviction what occurred in the petitioners collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas proceedingholding federal habeas proceeding was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies when petitioners direct appeal from resentencing was still pending in state court at the time he sought habeas reliefholding that once federal jurisdiction has attached it is not defeated by the petitioners release prior to completion of the proceedings on his habeas applicationholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nCourt should afford deference to the interpretation of the Board of Immigration Appeals, and hold that mandatory detention applies to Petitioner. (Id. at 3-7.) Second, Respondent objects that Magistrate Judge Theiler never addressed its argument that Petitioner\u2019s continued detention is lawful pursuant to INA \u00a7 236(a) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 241.8 and 241.4(c). (Dkt. No. 19 at 7-9.) Respondent asserts these provisions permit the district director or the director of detention and removal to exercise discretion, and asserts that Petitioner therefore has received all the benefits of due process that he is entitled to. (Id. at 9.) Discussion A. Mandatory Detention Petitioner is not subject to mandatory detention under INA \u00a7 236(c), because that section only requires mandatory dete 7 (W.D.Wash.1997) (<HOLDING>). Petitioner is deportable because of his 2001 holding that we have jurisdiction to review an aliens legal eligibility for relief under former ina 212cholding that an aliens express waiver of his right to appeal to the bia deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider the aliens subsequent petition for reviewholding that the failure to notify aliens counsel of an order to appear for deportation violated the aliens statutory right to counselholding that under permanent rules of hrira the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over claims of aliens ordered deported for crimes listed in ina and holding that district courts retain habeas jurisdiction over deportation orders of criminal aliensholding that the plain meaning of the statute indicates that ina 236c applies to aliens immediately after release from custody and not to aliens released many years earlier & \n\nbased upon legally sufficient evidence. To the extent that Moye is claiming that the verdicts were against the \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d under People v. Bleakley, 69 N.Y.2d 490, 495, 515 N.Y.S.2d 761, 508 N.E.2d 672 (N.Y.1987) (citations omitted), such an argument raised only-issues of New York state law and accordingly cannot provide a basis for habeas relief, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (permitting federal habeas corpus review only where the petitioner has alleged that he is in state custody in violation of \u201cthe Constitution or a federal law or treaty\u201d). Federal courts routinely dismiss claims attacking a verdict as against the weight of the evidence on the basis that they are not federal constitutional issues cognizable in a habeas proceeding. Ex parte Craig, 282 F. 138, 148 (2d Cir.1922) (<HOLDING>), aff'd, 263 U.S. 255, 44 S.Ct. 103, 68 L.Ed. holding that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to review the weight of evidence holding that a petition for review is an adequate substitute for habeas corpusholding that threeyear statute of limitations was not an unconstitutional suspension of the writ of habeas corpusholding a court cannot issue and make returnable to it a writ of habeas corpus if the petitioner is outside the courts authorityholding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpus & \n\nMoore, 917 F.2d at 221 (quoting United States v. Vinson, 606 F.2d 149, 154 (6th Cir.1979)). Further, the degree of proof requires \u201ca strong showing of factually specific and compelling prejudice.\u201d United States v. Benton, 852 F.2d 1456, 1469 (6th Cir.1988). Petitioner has fallen far short of presenting sufficient justification for severance. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claim regarding ineffective assistance must, in turn, be denied. In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, the pending Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus will be denied. This case is dismissed. The Court finds that based on the record, Petitioner\u2019s arguments and applicable case law, a certificate of appealability should not be issued. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). See Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 105 F.3d 1063, 1064 (6th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). An Order consistent with this Opinion will be holding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that the rule applies for purposes of habeas corpus under section 2254holding that district courts have authority to grant certificates of appealability under the recently amended habeas corpus frameworkholding a court cannot issue and make returnable to it a writ of habeas corpus if the petitioner is outside the courts authorityholding that order denying relief under fedrcivp 60b in a habeas setting is the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding subject to the certificate of appealability requirement of 28 usc 2253c1a 2000 & \n\navailable only if the violation of state law \u201craises federal constitutional problems.\u201d Wilcox v. Ford, 813 F.2d 1140, 1145 n.7 (11th Cir.1987). Thus, whether or not the state court erred under Alabama law in its rulings at Davis\u2019 trial is \u201clargely beside the point\u201d in the court\u2019s analysis. Jammed v. Van de Kamp, 926 F.2d 918, 920 (9th Cir.1991). IV. DISCUSSION Davis seeks habeas corpus relief as to his sentence of death based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Roper, supra, and the court addresses this claim first. Davis also has raised and briefed six constitutional guilt-phase claims attacking the validity of his judgment of conviction which the court will address in the order in which the claims are asserted by Davis. See Clisby v. Jones, 960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). A. Davis\u2019Sentence of Death This case no holding that district court must resolve all claims for relief premised on alleged constitutional violations which are raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus whether habeas relief is granted or deniedholding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that a petition for review is an adequate substitute for habeas corpusholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state lawholding that habeas claim not included in petition and never raised by petitioner before the district court as basis for habeas relief is procedurally defaulted & \n\njurisprudence in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management Sys., Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1744, 188 L.Ed.2d 829 (2014) and Octane Fitness, LLC v. ICON Health & Fitness, Inc., \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1749, 188 L.Ed.2d 816 (2014). Those decisions call into ques tion our two-part test for determining willfulness, In re Seagate Tech., LLC, 497 F.3d 1360 (Fed.Cir.2007) (en banc), and our de novo standard for reviewing the district court\u2019s willfulness determination, Bard Peripheral Vascular, Inc. v. W.L. Gore & Assocs., Inc., 682 F.3d 1003, 1006-07 (Fed.Cir.2012) (Bard II). See Halo Elecs., Inc. v. Pulse Elecs., Inc., 769 F.3d 1371, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2014) (O\u2019Malley, J., concurring). This case demonstrates why de no t. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (<HOLDING>). It would also be consistent with the standard holding habeas corpus is not a civil action for purposes of the equal access to justice act provision for award of attorney fees to prevailing partyholding abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing determinations of whether a litigants position is substantially justified for purposes of feeshifting under the equal access to justice act although the determination frequently turns on a purely legal issueholding that the standard of review under rule 60 is abuse of discretionholding that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretionholding abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing award of attorney fees in patent cases although questions of law may in some cases be relevant & \n\nsuffered from past persecution nor had a well-founded fear of future persecution because of his Indian ethnicity. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s and Immigration Judge\u2019s findings of fact that Petitioner was not credible and that he failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review and uphold the Board\u2019s decision. A. Adverse Credibility Determination The Immigration Judge denied Petitioner refugee status primarily because she found that he was not credible. After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that substantial evidence supports this adverse credibility determination. An adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Yu, 364 F.3d at 703 (<HOLDING>). Such a finding \u201ccannot be based on an holding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding that where asylum officer testifies regarding accuracy of interviewing procedures inconsistencies between petitioners asylum interview testimony and merits hearing testimony form sufficient basis to uphold adverse credibility determinationholding when one identified ground for an adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of petitioners claim of persecution the court is bound to accept the ijs adverse credibility determinationholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibility & \n\nthat when he interviewed Lewis she never mentioned anyone besides Slovik throwing pool balls, but she did state that Featherstone pushed Slovik to the ground and then kicked him, and that Buckley-Stoffel and Featherstone did not plan to inform the police about either that or the parking lot fight. 4 . After briefing, oral argument, and publication of an opinion in this case, the State argued for the first time in a petition for rehearing that Slovik did not sufficiently raise a Confrontation Clause argument in state court proceedings. Moreover, Slovik apparently cannot return to state court to raise a Confrontation Clause claim because he failed to raise the argument in his original state habeas petition. See In re Clark, 5 Cal.4th 750, 21 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 855 P.2d 729, 760 (1993) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, Slovik is no longer subject to holding that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to review the weight of evidence holding that district court must resolve all claims for relief premised on alleged constitutional violations which are raised in a petition for writ of habeas corpus whether habeas relief is granted or deniedholding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that absent justification for the failure to present all known claims in a single timely petition for writ of habeas corpus successive andor untimely petitions will be summarily deniedholding that a writ of habeas corpus cannot be used to review the weight of evidence & \n\nlima M. Rodriguez, a native and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying suspension of deportation and voluntary departure. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. Where, as here, the BIA conducts a de novo review of the record, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. See De Leon-Barrios v. INS, 116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition. The BIA properly denied suspension of deportation because Rodriguez, who was deported in 1992, did not accrue the requisite seven years\u2019 continuous presence in the United States. Cf. Barragan-Sanehez v. Rosenberg, 471 F.2d 758, 760 (9th Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The BIA properly denied voluntary departure holding that an aliens continuous physical presence is broken if the alien was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw an application for admissionholding that the failure to notify aliens counsel of an order to appear for deportation violated the aliens statutory right to counselholding bia did not err in determining request for stay of voluntary departure is not an implicit request for a withdrawal of voluntary departureholding that aliens continuous presence in the country was interrupted by voluntary departure under threat of deportation proceedingsholding that because aliens two previous voluntary departures were the result of implied agreements and were not therefore strictly voluntary they constituted significant departures that precluded a finding of seven years continuous presence in the united states under a rule that excused absences that were brief casual and innocent & \n\nrelief independently of Tan in addition to being included as a derivative party on her asylum claim. See AR at 395-401. The Immigration Judge (\"U\u201d) and BIA ultimately denied his application for cancellation of removal. See id. at 391, 379. 3 . An applicant for withholding of removal need not show that she would be singled out for persecution if she can demonstrate a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated to her on account of, inter alia, race or religion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). In the instant case, Tan did not raise the pattern or practice argument before the BIA, and therefore we are without jurisdiction to review such an argument, even though the BIA sua sponte addressed it. See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). In addition, she does not raise the argument holding that we lack jurisdiction to review a claim not brought before the bia even when the bia addresses it sua sponteholding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review decisions of the bia refusing to reopen immigration proceedings sua sponteholding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims not raised below by the alien even when the bia reviews the claim sua sponteholding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the biaholding that we will not review an issue or claim that was not presented to the bia in the petitioners notice of appeal or brief to the bia even if the bia considered the issue or claim sua sponte & \n\n434 (9th Cir. 1983). However, exceptions to that rule exist. See, e.g., Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 9-10, 103 S.Ct. 927, 933-34, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (stays leaving plaintiff \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d). In this case, the magistrate was free to recommend to the district court that Reynaga\u2019s action be stayed: if the district court had then adopted the recommendation, we would have jurisdiction over Reynaga\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order because the district court\u2019s action would have \u201cthe practical effect of refusing an injunction,\u201d Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 996, and would have left Reynaga \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d. Cone, 460 U.S. at 9-10, 103 S.Ct. at 933-34. See also Marchetti v. Bitterolf, 968 F.2d at 964-66 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Here, however, the magistrate did not holding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that appellate jurisdiction exists over district court order staying 1983 action until plaintiff exhausts habeas corpus remediesholding that habeas corpus petitions are premature until administrative remedies have been exhaustedholding that a federal district court has jurisdiction to stay an execution prior to the filing of a formal habeas corpus petitionholding that district courts do not have appellate jurisdiction over state courts & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nKamal Matian, a native and citizen of Iran, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s deportation order, which denied all relief except protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, Femandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review. Matian\u2019s sole contention, that he is eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c), is foreclosed by Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (9th Cir. 2002) (<HOLDING>). See also Saravia-Paguada v. Gonzales, 488 holding that iirira and aedpa are not applicable to criminal alien who entered a guilty plea at a time when alien was eligible for 212c reliefholding that bars on 212c relief do not apply to aliens entering preaedpa nolo contendere or guilty pleas in reliance on 212c availability but that those bars do apply to aliens convicted through other means prior to the enactment of aedpa and whose proceedings commenced postaedpaholding that we have jurisdiction to review an aliens legal eligibility for relief under former ina 212cholding that aliens who pleaded not guilty and elected a jury trial are barred from seeking 212c reliefholding that the relevant date is not when petitioner filed for 212c relief & \n\nCURIAM: Mirza Azamali Baig and his wife, Yas-meen Baig, natives and citizens of Pakistan, petition for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) order denying withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). They argue that they are entitled to relief based on a showing of past persecution and a fear of future persecution on account of their political opinions. To the extent that the Baigs argue that they were entitled to asylum, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the issue because the couple did not submit an application for asylum before either the IJ or the BIA. See Omari v. Holder, 562 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir. 2009) (<HOLDING>). We generally have authority to review only holding that claims not presented to the ij and bia should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remediesholding that we lack jurisdiction to review a claim not brought before the bia even when the bia addresses it sua sponteholding that we will not review an issue or claim that was not presented to the bia in the petitioners notice of appeal or brief to the bia even if the bia considered the issue or claim sua sponteholding that the petitioners failure to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the bia deprived the district court of jurisdiction to hear the issuerecognizing that failure to exhaust an issue before the bia strips us of jurisdiction & \n\nfor review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s removal order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review \u201cwhether substantial evidence supports a finding by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that [Valenzuela] abandoned [her] lawful permanent residence in the United States.\u201d Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, 335 F.Sd 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that the government met its burden of showing Valenzuela abandoned her lawful permanent resident status because the record does not compel the conclusion that she consistently intended promptly to return to the United States. See Singh v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); see also Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, 792 F.2d 932, holding that the rule 404b evidence admitted to prove intent was clearly relevant because intent was at issue in the trialholding that the relevant intent is not the intent to return ultimately but the intent to return to the united states within a relatively short periodholding that where congressional intent is clear a court must give effect to such intentholding that the only showing of intent required for a vcea claim is the intent to do the act involvedholding that removal for temporary employment with intent to return was not abandonment & \n\nseized literature of Khalistan and pamphlets relating to a protest rally, but he testified at the hearing that police found only a small sheet of paper and no pamphlets. We also think the IJ was within the bounds of reasonable adjudication in discounting Kaur\u2019s testimony that she was raped at the police station. The police conduct was heinous if the testimony is believed, and it is understandable that the female petitioner may have been reluctant to discuss such a degrading experience if it occurred. In light of the overall credibility problems with the testimony of Singh and Kaur, however, we cannot say that the IJ was compelled to accept Kaur\u2019s statements about the incident at the police station without some corroboration. See Esaka v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 1105, 1110 (8th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). In sum, because the record does not compel a holding that where testimony is inherently improbable the court may choose to disregard itholding that an adverse credibility determination may be dispositive where the applicant does not produce any corroborating evidenceholding that the jury is the judge of the weight and credibility given to witness testimonyholding jury as judge of credibility may believe all some or none of the testimonyholding that an immigration judge may base a credibility determination on the lack of corroborating evidence if the judge also encounters inconsistencies in testimony contradictory evidence or inherently improbable testimony & \n\nmilitary, intelligence, and diplomatic efforts secret.\u201d). In AHIF-Oregon\u2019s view, if classified information concerning national security demonstrates that an entity is supporting terrorism, OFAC either must decline to designate the entity or must reveal the classified information to the entity that OFAC believes supports terrorist activities. Common sense dictates that AHIF-Oregon is overreaching. Not surprisingly,, all federal courts to have considered this argument have rejected it.

The Penn National policies contain no language requiring the cause of injury to be identifiable before coverage is triggered. Our interpretation of the Penn National policies is confirmed by comparable cases applying the first manifestation rule to determine trigger of coverage under third party liability insurance policies.

We have approved of this analysis and, because the amended version of the VWPA contains identical language to the MVRA, we have further extended Hughey to the MVRA. United States v.

Trimac\u2019s appeal on this issue was deemed untimely by this Court, and consequently, we are constrained to review only Fenner\u2019s post-employment conduct. 11 . Some of the cases the majority offers to support its argument are inapplicable, as well, because they rely on a lower standard than that required in South Dakota.

Under \u00a7 1109(a), the fiduciary is liable for at least two types of damages: losses to the plan and profits made by the fiduciary.

Are we collaterally estopped from asserting a synergy argument against the tobacco companies because a jury has formerly held that the plaintiffs injury was not caused by asbestos?

Plaintiffs contend that underwriters do not exercise discretion and independent judgment concerning matters of significance because the underwriters do not bear any responsibility for financial loss and do not determine the financial risk that Huntington will take for any given loan. However, while underwriters do not determine Huntington\u2019s overall risk guidelines, they still make decisions that signifi cantly impact the business and do determine the risk Huntington will accept for any particular loan. Underwriters can approve loans between $250,000 and $1,000,000. Their approval of a loan binds Huntington to that risk, and their denial of an application prevents a customer from acquiring credit. Cf (<HOLDING>). Therefore, Huntington\u2019s underwriters satisfy holding that the analogous predecessor regulation to 29 cfr 541202a did not encompass an employee who made no decisions that affect even the small segment of the companys operations in which his work is performedholding that the fact that the insurance agents perform functions that are an essential part of the companys normal operations is a decisive factorholding that an employer is accountable to a discharged employee for unpaid compensation if the employee was terminated in bad faith and the compensation is clearly connected to work already performedholding futa after which florida molded its unemployment law is phrased entirely in terms of the nature of the employer and not in terms of the work performed or the place at which the employee worksholding that your work exclusion is triggered only where the damage at issue is to work performed by you and is caused by work performed by you and does not apply to damage caused to original construction of a house during later repair work & \n\nsubject to the exclusions in the policy\u201d). Accordingly, an additional insured not only reaps the benefits of the insured\u2019s policy, but it also bears the burden of the exclusions. It is further our view that, if the insurer intended to exclude indemnification agreements within insured contracts from the substantial restriction on coverage that the On-Premises Endorsement constitutes, the policy would have expressly so stated. See Maroney v. New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 5 N.Y.3d 467, 805 N.Y.S.2d 533, 839 N.E.2d 886, 889 (2005) (stating that \u201c[i]f the insurer intended to limit [an] exclusion * * * it could have done so explicitly, as it does in the very same policy\u2019s * * * provisions\u201d); see also Chimbay v.

The plaintiffs point out, if the first sentence of the exclusion is interpreted to be all-inclusive, the second sentence is superfluous. In light of the insurer\u2019s duty to define \u201cexclusionary clauses in clear and explicit terms,\u201d Homick, 511 N.W.2d at 374, we doubt that the clarifying language of the second sentence could properly be considered superfluous. In any event, notwithstanding our desire to interpret a policy so as not to render any part superfluous, \u201cwe will not do so when that [interpretation] is inconsistent with the structure and format of the [provision] and' when that [interpretation] is otherwise unreasonable.\u201d Kibbee, 525 N.W.2d at 869.

Plaintiffs contend that the term \u201cany fire insurance policy\u201d in the VPL refers to any homeowner\u2019s insurance policy in Louisiana that covers fire and other perils, such as wind. Plaintiffs assert that there is no such thing as a single-peril fire policy in Louisiana, that the term \u201cfire policy\u201d is broadly used in the insurance industry to refer to a homeowner\u2019s policy, and that Louisiana courts have applied the VPL to losses caused by perils other than fire. After extensive briefing and oral argument on the question of whether the VPL applies to hazards other than fire, the Court has concluded that it need not answer this question to resolve the dispute.

This testing, which generates information for submission pursuant to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, therefore falls squarely within the scope of the safe harbor. Finally, the dissent suggests that we must reject any disequilibrium between sections 201 and 202 of the Hatch-Wax-man Act, that is, the safe harbor should not be available unless a patent term extension is also available.

It is not disputed by the parties that these records are produced in order to develop and submit to the FDA proof that the Amphastar products comply with a Federal law.

On October 17, 2006, OxBlue first published the OxBlue Specification. The Ox-Blue Specification was not registered with the Copyright Office until March 13, 2012. OxBlue is not entitled to statutory damages and attorneys\u2019 fees because the Ox-Blue Specification was not registered at the time the alleged infringement occurred, or within the 3-month safe harbor period between publication and registration. See M.G.B. Homes, Inc. v. Ameron Homes, Inc., 903 F.2d 1486, 1493 (11th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>).

Moreover, in support of its position on the subject matter scope of the waiver in this case, DuPont Dow has failed to cite any patent infringement case where a party asserted reliance upon the opinion of counsel as a defense and the court limited the waiver to a subject matter more narrow than whether a patent was valid, not infringed, or unenforceable. See Def.\u2019s Mem. at 5-8; see also Applied Telematics, 1995 WL 567436, at *3 (limiting the scope of the waiver to the issue of infringement); Mushroom Assoc., 1992 WL 442892, at *3 (<HOLDING>); Saint-Gobain, 884 F.Supp. at 34 (holding that holding that knowledge of the patent is required for willful infringementholding in a patent case that when the plaintiff brought the suit in federal district court it submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to all the issues embraced in the suit including those pertaining to the counterclaim of the defendantsholding a nonparty to a patent infringement suit who funded an unsuccessful challenge to a patent could not file a subsequent lawsuit again challenging the patentholding that alleged infringer waived privilege with respect to all documents pertaining to the infringement of the patentholding that the objective prong for willful infringement is generally not met where an accused infringer relies on a reasonable defense to a charge of infringement & \n\nthe rule allows such a safe harbor.\u201d Id. Although Guardsmark explained the safe harbor to some employees, the Board found the company\u2019s explanation \u201cplainly insufficient to avoid a violation of the Act [because] narrowing interpretations of overly broad rules must be communicated to the entire work force covered by the rule.\u201d Id. at *5. Guardsmark argues that nothing in the rule explicitly prohibits off-duty solicitation and that employees would not reasonably so construe it, especially after the company clarified the rule\u2019s safe harbor. We disagree. To begin with, because Guardsmark failed to communicate the safe harbor clarification to all employees who had received the handbook, the Board properly focused on the rule\u2019s language. See Ichikoh Mfg., Inc., 312 N.L.R.B. 1022, 1022 (1993) (<HOLDING>). And because that language prohibits holding that it is notholding that employees failure to comply with employers rule requiring employees to notify employer when a temporary job placement ended did not constitute gross misconduct because the violation was an isolated incident and employer did not try to show that its staffing ability had suffered serious or indeed any consequences as a result of employees unavailabilityholding that an employer must establish all three elements of the defense with regard to its employees in order to prevailholding that an employer must show that it clearly communicated to all the employees to whom the presumptively invalid rule was disseminated that the rule did not mean what it saidholding that the hospital failed to show how it was harmed by failure to verify the rule to show cause & \n\nis subjected to the heightened pleading standard of Iqbal and Twombly \u201d). Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

B.Burden of Proof The party making the allegations of infringement \u2014 here, Tiffany \u2014 -has the burden of proof to present evidence in support of the allegations set forth in its complaint and to prove those allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. See Merit Diamond Corp. v. Suberi Bros., Inc., No. 94 Civ. 4572(SHS), 1996 WL 11192, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan.11, 1996) (<HOLDING>); McGraw-Hill, Inc. v.

A fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d for purposes of summary judgment when proof of that fact would establish or refute an essential element of the claim or a defense advanced by either party. Kendall v. Hoover Co., 751 F.2d 171, 174 (6th Cir.1984) (citation omitted). A patent enjoys a presumption of validity pursuant to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282. \u201cConsequently, \u2018a moving party seeking to invalidate a patent at summary judgment must submit such clear and convincing evidence of invalidity so that no reasonable jury could find otherwise.\u2019 \u201d Chrimar Sys. v. Cisco Sys., 318 F.Supp.2d 476, 491 (E.D.Mich.2004) (quoting Eli Lilly & Co. v. Barr Labs., 251 F.3d 955, 962 (Fed.Cir. 2001) ); see also Beckson Marine, Inc. v.

In sum, whether Odettes\u2019 delay in filing suit against defendants is taken as six years or three, it was clearly unreasonable in the circumstances of this case. Because the delay is inexcusable, and because defendants suffered prejudice from it, this case is an appropriate one in which to apply the doctrine of laches. Odettes is therefore barred from recovering damages from any of these defendants for any infringement occurring before June 29,1995. An appropriate Order has already issued. The Clerk is directed to send copies of this Memorandum Opinion to all counsel of record. 1 . A more complete recitation of the facts appears in a previous Memorandum Opinion in this case. See Odetics, Inc. v. Storage Technology Corp., 906 F.Supp. 324 (E.D.Va. 1995) (<HOLDING>). 2 .

Given this, and given Major Bux-ton\u2019s strong privacy interests in her personnel files, it is clear that even under the more exacting standard of \u00a7 552(b)(6), disclosure of the requested documents would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. Thus, the requested documents are properly exempt from disclosure under FOIA. III. Because the requested documents are exempt from disclosure under either \u00a7 552(b)(6) or \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C), and consequently, also under the Privacy Act, plaintiffs motion for summary judgment must be denied and the Air Force\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be granted.

Amerada Hess Corp., 379 F.3d 32, 43 (2d Cir.2004). Reynolds\u2019s first argument fails because it mischaracterizes the district court\u2019s decision. The district court did not find that Reynolds\u2019s intoxication caused his injuries. Instead, it found that although Reynolds was acting in the course of his employment, see 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104, his injuries could not be legally attributed to the defendants\u2019 alleged negligence because the defendants did not own the bus that injured Reynolds and otherwise had no duty to provide a safe means of transportation between the M\/V Bennett and Reynolds\u2019s chosen venue for shore-leave amusement. We identify no error in that conclusion, which is consistent with the undisputed facts and the law. See Thurnau v. Alcoa S.S. Co., 229 F.2d 73, 74 (2d Cir.1956) (<HOLDING>). Reynolds\u2019s second argument fails because of holding where there is no duty to defend there is no duty to indemnifyholding no duty and noting that foreseeability bears on the scope of a duty and not whether it exists in the first placeholding that employer has nondelegable duty to provide safe workplaceholding that shipowner is under no duty to provide a safe means of transportation between the ship and any place of amusement crew members desire to visit while on shore leaverecognizing a state law tort claim for negligence arising under a duty to provide a safe work environment & \n\nare the jurisdictional contacts of the other for the purposes of the International Shoe due process analysis.\u201d Id. at 653 (emphasis in original). The Court has already determined that Biomeasure and Ipsen Pharma are not the \u201csame entity\u201d for jurisdictional purposes. Accordingly, Ipsen Pharma is not a \u201cmere continuation\u201d of Biomeasure, and it is not subject to this Court\u2019s jurisdiction as a successor-in-interest to Biomeasure. In acquiring the '186 patent, Ipsen Pharma may have submitted to the jurisdiction of the District Court for the District of Columbia, see 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 293, but it did not submit to jurisdiction in Louisiana simply because the patent may have arisen out of research in Louisiana. See Panda Brandywine Corp. v. Potomac Elec. Power Co., 253 F.3d 865, 869 (5th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); Purdue Research Foundation v. holding that personal jurisdiction was lacking when the only contact by defendant with forum state was initiated by plaintiffs counsels paralegal for the sole purpose of establishing personal jurisdictionholding that personal jurisdiction over a party is proper if the party has sufficient minimum contacts with the forumholding that foreseeability of causing injury in texas though not determinative is important consideration in establishing minimum contactsholding that although an automobile is mobile by its very design and purpose thus indicating that it is foreseeable that a particular automobile may cause injury in a forum state foreseeability alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the due process clauseholding that foreseeability of causing injury in forum state is not sufficient for specific personal jurisdiction & \n\nthat the post-petition earnings of Mr. Markosian are property of the chapter 7 estate by operation of \u00a7 541(a)(7), we reject that argument. Section 541(a)(7) makes property of the estate any interest in properly that the estate (not the debtor) acquires after the case. Here, the bankruptcy court found that the bonus constituted earnings from personal services of Mr. Markosian under \u00a7 1115(a)(2) and that ruling was not appealed. Thus, the earnings fall within the earnings exception stated in \u00a7 541(a)(6). We note however that there may be chapter 11 cases which are converted to chapter 7 where it is necessary to separate earnings from personal services by an individual from the earnings of a business. See FitzSimmons v. Walsh (In re FitzSimmons), 725 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir.1984) holding noncompete payments were not exempt from the debt ors bankruptcy estate as earnings from postpetition services under 541a6 because the noncompete agreement was inextricably intertwined with the debtors sale of stock that was an includable bankruptcy asset that predated debtors bankruptcy petitionholding that where the debtor is the owner of a policy insuring his own life and listing his wife as the beneficiary upon his death the proceeds of the policy including the cash value thereof are exempt from the claims of the insureds creditorsholding that proceeds of a personal injury settlement are not exempt under missouri lawholding that where subchapter s corporations revenue was generated from professional accounting services of its sole shareholder or from personal services performed under him funds generated by the business which shareholder withdrew to pay personal expenses although not denominated wages for purposes of bookkeeping could be considered wages for purposes of calculating preinjury wageholding that only the debtors earnings from his own personal services were exempt under 541a6 as opposed to all profits generated by his law practice & \n\nis a necessary element of a computer-based corresponding structure.

The Supreme Court has rarely found the \"exclusivity\u201d aspect of this test to be met. See Mark, 51 F.3d at 1142. Furthermore, courts have held that the provision of hospital services is not a traditional public function exclusively reserved to the state. See, e.g., Shannon v.

Although Alabama cases recognize that a quotient verdict may still be presumed despite a minor deviation between the quotient and the verdict, see Harris, 288 Ala. at 378, 261 So.2d at 46, no Alabama case has ever considered discrepancies as large as $10,000 and $25,000 to indicate mere mathematical adjustments, or \u201crounding off,\u201d to an agreed-upon quotient, even in relation to a $200,000 verdict.

So construed, this argument is cognizable under Rule 35(a). Fowler, 794 F.2d at 1449 (<HOLDING>).

For example, the panel opinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski\u2019s assailant fled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he heard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police. Instead, the panel held that \u201cno rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski\u2019s screams.\u201d O\u2019Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 302. Although it would be entirely permissible for a jury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying the Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between competing reasonable inferences in this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>).

The district court then stated, however, that \u201c[b]efore there can be any liability under section 1983, there must be \u2018a direct causal link\u2019 between the personal conduct of Deputy Lopez or the municipal conduct of Sonoma County and the alleged constitutional deprivation, in this case the murder of Mar g that \u201cour first inquiry in any case alleging mu nicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 is the question whether there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation\u201d); Kibbe, 480 U.S. at 267, 107 S.Ct. 1114 (stating that \u201cthe Court repeatedly has stressed the need to find a direct causal connection between municipal conduct and the constitutional deprivation\u201d) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); Harris, 664 F.2d at 1125 (<HOLDING>) (footnote omitted).

Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v.

Defendant then filed a motion for mistrial pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1061 on the basis that the jury had heard extraneous informa tion in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial, it inquired of the prosecutors and defense counsel as to their wishes regarding the jury in the capital sentencing proceeding. The prosecutor expressed a willingness to replace juror eleven with an alternate juror for the capital sentencing proceeding. However, defense counsel argued that the trial court had err 9, 192 (1971) (<HOLDING>). In State v. Bunning, 346 N.C. 253, 256, 485 holding a directed verdict motion stating specific grounds is a prerequisite for a subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdictholding that notwithstanding defendants consent the verdict was a nullity where the trial court proceeded to verdict with a jury of elevenholding defendants failure to file motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict did not prevent district court from granting motion for directed verdict for which court reserved decisionholding that district court could not decide after jury returned verdict to treat jury verdict as advisory on issue not triable of right by jury but which was tried by consent of parties to nonadvisory juryholding that after court dismissed case at plaintiffs request notwithstanding the fact that jury had deliberated upon the case and indicated that it had reached a verdict there was no case pending in court on which a verdict could be predicated and the information which the judge got from an inspection of the petition handed to him by the foreman of the jury was information which he received as an individual and not as a judge of the court and further holding that despite violation of defendants right to receive the verdict that was purportedly reached the writing incorporated in the bill of exceptions as a verdict of the jury was in law no verdict because it was not received in court and published as required by law and was instead entirely extraneous and extrajudicial & \n\nthe court should not have imposed an offense level of 34. He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

(d) Martin argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument repeatedly misled the jury regarding the effect of a sentence of guilty but mentally ill. While it was not improper for the prosecutor to state that it would not be justice for the jury to impose a sentence of guilty but mentally ill if it was not supported by the evidence, we agree that it was improper to refer to such a verdict using the phrases, \u201ca break\u201d and \u201ca pass,\u201d and by making similar arguments. We note, however, that such language would have been permissible in the sentencing phase where, regardless of whether the jury had found Martin guilty or guilty but mentally ill, the jury would be choosing between imposing a death sentence or granting mercy. See Lewis v. State, 279 Ga. 756, 764 (12) (620 SE2d 778) (2005) (<HOLDING>). Because Martin did not object to this line of holding that the verdict must be sustained if there is any competent evidence to support the verdictholding that the trial court erred in granting the school boards posttrial motion for directed verdict because although the school board timely moved for a directed verdict during trial it did not serve its motion for directed verdict until the eleventh day after the verdictholding that the statute that provides for a verdict of guilty but mentally ill does not preclude a death sentence as the result of such a verdictholding that a jury verdict of guilty constitutes a conviction for purposes of the federal firearms statute and therefore the defendant was convicted of a felony during the interval between the jurys return of its guilty verdict and his scheduled sentencingholding that where the evidence offered by the state and admitted by the trial court whether erroneously or not would have been sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict the double jeopardy clause does not preclude retrial & \n\nimproper. We agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that punitive damages are not available under the Act, and we emphasize that the trial court should have made clear to the jury that it could not award punitive damages based upon a violation of the Consumer Protection Act. The trial court\u2019s omission certainly leaves open the possibility that the jury wrongly awarded punitive damages in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Act rather than in connection with a common law claim for recovery. Although we cannot assume that the jury understood the relevant law, since it was not properly instructed, we decline to assume the inverse, as did the Court of Appeals, that the jury found only a violation of the .C.App. 237, 446 S.E.2d 100, 105 (1994) (<HOLDING>). Some courts merely state that the higher holding that where a plaintiff is entitled to treble damages under its state unfair trade practices act and to punitive damages under common law claims of fraud trial court should have submitted each theory of recovery to the jury and then allowed plaintiff to elect between the awards with duplicative elementsholding that even if the trial court had erred in denying the defendants motion for a directed verdict on punitive damages the error was harmless because the jury found in favor of the defendant and never reached the punitive damages claimsholding that the trial court erred by denying plaintiffs request to instruct the jury on all its claims and to submit a special verdict form and by instead requiring the plaintiff to elect between its statutory antitrust claim and its common law tort claims to be submitted to the juryholding that trial court erred by requiring plaintiff to select which remedy to submit to the jury because plaintiff was allowed to elect its remedy between punitive damages and statutory treble after the jurys verdict on all claims was renderedholding that a plaintiff is entitled to either statutory treble damages or punitive damages whichever is the greater & \n\nlong as a \u2018person has obtained a benefit from another by fraud, duress, or the taking of undue advantage.\u2019 \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Newington Ltd. v.

On the other hand, a decent respect for the collective wisdom of the jury and for the function entrusted to it in our system, certainly suggests that in most cases the judge should accept the findings of the jury, regardless of its own doubts on the matter. Probably all that the judge can do is balance these conflicting principles in light of the facts of the particular case. If, after having given full respect to the jury\u2019s findings, the judge on the entire evidence is left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed, it is to be expected that he will grant a new trial. 11 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 2806 (2d ed.1995). See also Clay v. Ford Motor Co., 215 F.3d 663, 672 (6th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>) (citation omitted). 2.

The once-existing special relationship and ability to control Haar\u2019s treatment disintegrated as a result of Haar\u2019s failure after March 8, 2000, to seek Defendant\u2019s assistance in any regard and Haar\u2019s having chosen other mental health providers to handle his treatment and medication.

Regarding the \u00a7 1983 claim, they were instructed that appellant had to establish that the officers used \u201cexcessive and unnecessary force to arrest him and hold him thereafter.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict can be reconciled only if a distinction can be made between unreasonable force and excessive or unnecessary force. Although appellant argues that the jury could have found a \u00a7 1983 violation based on the denial of medical assistance, the jury was not instructed on this theory, nor was it argued by appellant\u2019s counsel, and appellant did not object to the lack of such an instruction. Similarly, there was no instruction on negligent misuse of authorized force, nor any claim that the officers\u2019 actions were other than intentional. Cf. Wilson v. Beebe, 743 F.2d 342, 350 (6th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>).

As a general matter, a \u00a7 1983 action may be brought in either a state or federal forum. Thus, conceivably, concurrent state and federal jurisdiction could exist over the Marcuses\u2019 damages claim. In the present case, however, the state action is criminal in nature and was initiated by the State of Pennsylvania in its criminal court. Pennsylvania law makes no provision by which the Marcuses could raise their \u00a7 1983 claim in a state criminal forum. See Hutchins v. Commonwealth, Pa.

The district court stated that although the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cwould have no impact upon the [c]ourt\u2019s sentencing decision,\u201d it would impact the court\u2019s decision if \u201cthe Supreme Court later determine[d] that Blakely [v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)] extends to federal sentencing.\u201d As mentioned above, the special verdict indicated that Soreide was responsible for $7 million to $20 million in actual loss and more than $20 million in intended loss, and that he participated as an organizer or leader. Because these jury findings were identical to those made by the sentencing judge and because they would be applied upon resentencing, any constitutional error was harmless. See United States v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>).

Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (noting that the inquiry to determine prejudice is the same between plain error and harmless error, but that the defendant, rather than the government, bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice under plain-error review); Chapman v.

We agree. Appellants correctly argue that McCracken\u2019s act of committing suicide by jumping in front of a fifty-thousand pound tractor-trailer traveling at seventy miles per hour was an intentional, rather than a negligent, act. See Wyke v. Polk County Sch. Bd., 137 F.3d 1292, 1293 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming the trial court\u2019s refusal to -include the name of a teenage boy who committed suicide on the verdict form because the boy\u2019s suicide constituted an intentional act). Therefore, McCracken\u2019s name should not have been, and should not be, included on the verdict form. See id.; see also Stellas v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., 702 So.2d 232, 233-34 (Fla.1997) (<HOLDING>); Jones v.

Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C.

Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967)) (emphasis added)). As this Court has explained, exclusion A.7 is not ambiguous on the issue of whether a pickup is a private passenger auto. Cf. Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\nthe jury.\u201d). This is particularly true where the arrest occurred on January 31, 2007, over four years prior to the incident which gave rise to this action. Accordingly, evidence of Goodman\u2019s prior arrest to establish that she in fact engaged in acts of prostitution is excluded. In addition to using this evidence to establish truthfulness of any alleged defamatory statements, Defendants also seek its admission on the question of defamation damages. Although Goodman\u2019s, San Diego arrest may be minimally relevant to her reputation at the time she was detained at the Cosmopolitan, reputational damage is presumed in a slander per se action like this one, as explained below in the Court\u2019s discussion of Goodman\u2019s defamation claim.

Morris argues that by not requiring the court to define the limits of reasonable doubt, Mississippi is in effect trampling upon the requirement that the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Mississippi however has a longstanding policy of relying upon jurors to determine whether their doubt is reasonable, and prohibits any instruction that would presume to define the nature of reasonable doubt.

IS THE VERDICT CONTRARY TO THE OVERWHELMING WEIGHT OF THE EVID 03, 806 (1957) (<HOLDING>). This Court cannot substitute its judgment holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting testimony to only one witness where additional witnesses would have provided the same testimonyholding that a district court was entitled to accept or reject testimony on the basis of the witnesses demeanor and candor or lack thereof and contradictions in the witnesses testimonyholding that strength of testimony is not the result of a calculus of witnessesholding that material for witnesses need not be produced to defendant where the witnesses were not called as government witnesses at trialholding that selfinterested witnesses can be reliable when they provide detailed testimony that is corroborated by other witnesses or facts & \n\nthat overall lessen the State\u2019s burden of proof violate due process. B. Medina contends that the instruction improperly diminished the State\u2019s burden of proof. When explaining reasonable doubt to the jury, the trial court stated: \u201cwhen we talk about a reasonable doubt we mean doubt from which a reason can be given, a doubt which arises from a fair and rational consideration of the evidence or perhaps the lack of evidence, it means a doubt as would cause a man of ordinary prudence to pause or hesitate when called upon to act in the most important aspects of life.\u201d This portion of the charge was incorrect. It erroneously implies that the jury must find an articulable reason to support its doubts about the State\u2019s case. See State v. Vaszorich, 13 N.J. 99, 115, 98 A.2d 299 (1953) (<HOLDING>). Jurors may harbor a valid reasonable doubt holding that a court must allow the defendant to ask in voir dire whether a potential juror would automatically impose the death penalty and suggesting that such a juror should be disqualified for causeholding that trial courts denial of motion for new trial based on juror misconduct was justified where there was no evidence presented at hearing on motion that juror had knowingly concealed relevant litigation experience during voir dire and identity of juror as county court litigant was not demonstratedholding that the statement contained in a juror pamphlet that a reasonable doubt is one for which should he be called upon a juror can give a reason was obviously erroneous under our lawholding that though judge did not question juror individually note from juror to judge requesting private meeting to ask legal question did not suggest juror would not base verdict on evidenceholding phone call to defendant from purported juror saying we were pressured into making our decision inadequate to permit juror interview & \n\nthat? (Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter.

The district court stated that although the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cwould have no impact upon the [c]ourt\u2019s sentencing decision,\u201d it would impact the court\u2019s decision if \u201cthe Supreme Court later determine[d] that Blakely [v.

On appeal, the Estate concedes that the instruction is a correct statement of the law and that it was not covered by other instructions. However, the Estate contends that the instruction was not supported by the evidence in the record because the alleged sudden emergency was the faked left syndrome and the faked left syndrome does not apply to the accident in question. As discussed supra, no evidence was presented to support the applicability of the faked left syndrome, and the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony regarding the faked left syndrome. Consequently, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by instructing the jury regarding sudden emergency. See, e.g., Collins v. Rambo, 831 N.E.2d 241, 249 (Ind.Ct.App.2005) (<HOLDING>). We address the ramifications of this abuse of holding trial court erred by instructing jury that employer would be liable under burk if plaintiff showed improper motive was a factor in the decision to discharge him rather than a significant factorholding that defendant failed to plead sufficient facts and instructing the trial court to dismiss the plaintiff from the caseholding that sudden emergency is an affirmative defense which must be specifically pleadholding that trial court erred by instructing jury regarding sudden emergencyholding that trial court erred in instructing the jury on unavoidable accident when no evidence supported its submission & \n\nguilty\u201d was reasonable, and thus, trial court properly instructed jury to continue deliberating). 36 See OCGA \u00a7 17-9-40 (\u201cA verdict may be amended in mere matter of form after the jury have dispersed; but, after it has been received, recorded, and the jury dispersed, it may not be amended in matter of substance, either by what the jurors say they intended to find or otherwise.\u201d); Groves, 162 Ga. at 166 (\u201cThere must be the unanimous assent of the entire twelve jurors before there is a legal verdict.

Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\ninstruction notes that if the defendant is not also charged with malice murder, the words in parentheses should be omitted. See id. In this case, although Appellant was not indicted for malice murder, the trial court included the parenthetical words in its jury instruction on felony murder. The court also charged that if the jury found that Appellant was \u201cguilty of the offense of murder with malice af n that the State had to prove malice aforethought for Appellant to be found guilty of felony murder made it harder for the State to make its case, since malice aforethought is not an element of felony murder (although it is not inconsistent with that crime). Instructional errors that could only benefit a defendant are harmless. See Sanders v. State, 283 Ga. 372, 375 (659 SE2d 376) (2008) (<HOLDING>); Brown v.

See id.; Coates v. State, 534 N.E.2d 1087, 1093 (Ind.1989). Trial counsel was under no obligation to tender an instruction regarding the voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s statements, and the trial court would not have been obligated to present such an instruction to the jury. See Abbott v. State, 535 N.E.2d 1169, 1173 (Ind.1989) (upholding the trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession which specifically instructed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time an alleged admission was made); Gibson v. State, 694 N.E.2d 748, 756 (Ind.Ct.App.1998) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds, 702 N.E.2d 707 holding that trial court did not err in refusing to give charge because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that his requested charge was tailored to the evidenceholding that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the defendants tendered instruction regarding the voluntariness of his confessionholding that trial court did not errholding the determination of the voluntariness of a confession is a determination uninfluenced by the truth or falsity of the confessionholding that the district court did not err in refusing to give the defendants requested instruction concerning his mistaken belief about united states citizenship because the court had given an instruction covering the elements of the crime including the mens rea element & \n\nIt\u2019s a rather unusual circumstance, but I\u2019ve heard it before. Obviously, it\u2019s not unusual for participants in a trial to watch the jury, but we want to be sure that the jury is not made uncomfortable. So if I\u2019m correct that the regular attendees have been members of the family or friends of the defendants, I would appreciate counsel commenting to them when and as appropriate that we don\u2019t want to make the jurors uncomfortable, and what\u2019s actually a lot more interesting about a trial is what goes on in the well of the court and from the witness stand as opposed to the jury. So I share that with you just so you can convey the court\u2019s mild concern that the jurors not be made uncomfortable. It\u2019s nothing more than that. Okay? J.A. 915-16.

See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v. Meza, 235 F.3d 287, 291 (7th Cir.2000); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (explaining that due process \u201ccalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\u201d). That said, the precedents shed some light on the government\u2019s obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurementholding us mail sufficient to give notice but mail cannot be expected to notify person who is missing or unknownholding rules of civil procedure are appropriate in determining what constitutes proper service by certified mailholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he was given sufficient notice of the administrative forfeiture proceeding through certified mailholding that if service done by certified mail action commenced upon receipt of summons and complaint & \n\nlittle mitigating weight in tijis case. \u00b6 47 Appellant further contends the trial court erred when it failed to regard the giving of a felony murder instruction at trial as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance. We disagree. This court has held that a felony murder instruction \u201cmay be mitigating where there is some doubt as to a defendant\u2019s specific intent to' kill.\u201d State v. Henry, 189 Ariz. 542, 552, 944 P.2d 57, 67 (1997). Appellant\u2019s actions in savagely beating and strangling the victim to death, however, undermine any argument that he did not intend to kill the victim. Moreover, the jurors unanimously found Appellant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder as well as felony murder, indicating that they found\" intent to kill. See Atwood, 171 Ariz. at 648-49, 832 P.2d at 665-66 (<HOLDING>). We therefore conclude that the giving of a holding that when the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of premeditated and felony murder a jury instruction on unanimity is irrelevantholding that reversal of conviction for felony murder was required where jury failed to find the defendant guilty of the underlying felony as essential element of the felony murder offenseholding that where both firstdegree and felony murder were possible bases for a murder conviction a jury instruction that suggested the jury could rely on felony murder as the predicate offense for a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder was improper because under arizona law a conviction for conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder requires a specific intent to killholding that the eighth amendment requires finding that a felony murder defendant killed or attempted to killholding that the giving of a felony murder instruction is not a relevant mitigating circumstance when the defendant acted alone to kill the victim & \n\nas follows: When a company sells or transfers its assets to another company, the successor company does not acquire the liabilities of the transferor\u2019s assets, unless (1) The sale transaction is, in effect, a consolidation or merger.

Id. In the case before us, a jury could find that a vehicle suddenly spinning out of control immediately ahead of defendant-driver created a spontaneous reaction not necessarily present when vehicles are stopped in the road ahead of a driver who is able to see the stopped vehicles before the collision. Based upon our de novo review, we conclude that the rear-end collision instruction amounted to harmless error and that the sudden emergency jury instruction was correctly given. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred in granting the motion for new trial. See Lieberman v. Bliss-Doris Realty Associates, L.P., 819 A.2d 666, 673 (R.I.2003) (<HOLDING>). Conclusion We vacate the order of the holding that trial judge should have granted new trial rather than judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the judge could not know in what order the jury reached its inconsistent verdictsholding that a motion to intervene filed after final judgment should have been grantedholding that the presentation of a new theory does not constitute the presentation of a new issue on which a jury trial should be granted as of right under rule 38bholding that where jury has been properly instructed counsel is not ineffective for failing to object to an instructionholding new trial should not have been granted because jury was properly instructed & \n\nyears to life for a first conviction and a penalty of 20 years to life for a second or subsequent conviction\u201d; subsection (b) sets forth what \u201ccould properly [be] characterized as an \u2018aggravated\u2019 continuing criminal enterprise,\u201d carrying a mandatory life term, and requiring additional \u201celements\u201d to be proven. Montalvo argues that his \u201cillegal mandatory life sentence must be corrected to a term authorized by the facts reflected in the basic verdict for a continuing criminal enterprise.\u201d It appears that Montalvo argues that he was convicted of a \u201cbasic\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(a), but sentenced for an \u201caggravated\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(b). So construed, this argument is cognizable under Rule 35(a). Fowler, 794 F.2d at 1449 (<HOLDING>). However, Montalvo\u2019s challenge fails on the holding that rule 35a can be used to challenge sentences that are not authorized by the judgment of convictionholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding that affidavits that are conclusory and based on hearsay can not be used to oppose motion for summary judgmentrecognizing that the phrases can be used interchangeablyholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him & \n\nreferrals to specialists\u2014 the discrimination provision is sufficiently clear in apprising physicians that they may not provide firearm-owning patients with less medical care than they would other patients, in any circumstances. Thus, the discrimination provision of the Act is not vague. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the harassment provision of the Act, \u00a7 709.338(6), is vague because the Act does not define \u201cunnecessarily harassing.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that patients may hold diverse views as to what constitutes unnecessary harassment.

The plain language of the section clearly states that if either a local ordinance or a state statute under chapter 6 creates a duty for a vehicle operator that is any more or less than that stated in this section (which, inter alia, is to exercise the appropriate pre caution upon observing any child), that ordinance or statute is set aside.

IRIS maintains, however, that under Novo Industries our inquiry is com p\u00edete if the proper way to correct the error is not apparent from the face of the patent, even if the proper correction is clear from the prosecution history.

An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin.

Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa.

The court again asked defendant whether he wished to persist in his plea of guilty or whether he wanted to interpose a defense. Defendant repeatedly answered that he did not want to withdraw his plea, nor was he trying to plead self-defense. At one point during the extended colloquy the defendant made the statement, \u201cI\u2019ve already waived the right for counsel, so I just plead guilty.\u201d The court eventually accepted the plea of guilty and found that it had a factual basis.

Smith, 156 F.3d 1046, 1057 holding district courts adoption of the presentence report constitutes sufficient findingsholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that where the government has not presented evidence at the hearing concerning the appropriate amount of restitution the imposition of the restitution order constitutes plain errorholding that a district courts failure to make the necessary findings related to a restitution order constitutes plain errorholding that the district courts failure to instruct the jury as to the proper standard of proof constituted plain error & \n\nappeal waiver. 14 F.Supp.2d 816, 819 (E.D.Va.1998). The court concluded that the defendant could still file a petition under \u00a7 2255 if his claim alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or challenged the voluntariness of the guilty plea. Id. In sum, a \u00a7 2255 waiver should not bar ineffective assistance of counsel claims or claims that a guilty plea was involuntary, just as direct appeal waivers do not bar those claims. General enforcement of \u00a7 2255 waivers, subject to the same exceptions as direct appeal waivers, aligns with precedent from other district courts in this Circuit that have indicated a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to file a \u00a7 2255 motion is as valid as a waiver of the right to a direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 113 F.Supp.2d 879, 898 (E.D.Va.1999) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Tayman, 885 F.Supp. 832, 834 holding that a failure to file an appeal is within the scope of the waiver because the failure does not undermine the validity of the plea or waiverholding the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding a defendants waiver of appellate rights in a plea agreementholding that the united states breach of the plea agreement releases the defendant from the appeal waiverholding that a plea agreement with a waiver of direct appeal rights does not include a waiver of collateral remedies because the government could have included a waiver of collateral rights in the plea agreement and chose not to do soholding that a waiver of right to appeal contained in a plea agreement is enforceable & \n\n(citing Supreme Court cases noting the permissibility of limitations on speech, privacy, and self-incrimination protections where a citizen works for a government agency). As noted below, such limitations have been expressly considered when ascertaining the exercise of a right of intimate association. Here, the FBI\u2019s conduct regulations limited certain conduct on government property, including cohabitation or sleeping in a room at the FBI Academy other than one to which the NAT is assigned. (See Def.\u2019s Ex. 1 at 23.) A regulation that may implicate certain aspects of relationships between fellow NATs is rationally related to the government interest of instilling and maintaining a certain code of conduct. See Mercure v. Van Buren Tp., Mi., 81 F.Supp.2d 814, 827 (E.D.Mich.2000) (<HOLDING>); cf. LaVergne, 371 F.3d at 882 (holding that a holding that an officers use of force against a plaintiff was objectively reasonable considering the force the plaintiff herself exercised in resisting police custodyholding that concerns of cohesiveness among members of a police force justified prohibitions on relationships between the plaintiff and a fellow officerrecognizing that the fellow officer rule functions to include officers outside the common investigationholding that expert testimony on what constitutes deadly physical force and whether the use of force was justified should have been excludedholding that discharge of a police officer for the choice to enter into a relationship with the wife of his superior officer on the force was rational & \n\nchallenge a vehicle search from passenger standing to seek suppression of evidence discovered in a vehicle as the fruit of an unlawful stop, detention, or arrest.\u201d). Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>).

The narrowest ground for the court's disposition in Williams is that of the lead opinion and Justice Thomas: the subject report was not testimonial. But, as the Arizona Supreme Court recently explained, the plurality's 'primary purpose' test nor Justice Thomas's solemnity standard can be deemed a subset of the other; therefore, there is no binding rule for determining when reports are testimonial.\" State v. Medina, 232 Ariz. 391, 306 P.3d 48, 63 (2013) (citing United States v. Alcon Aluminum Corp., 315 F.3d 179, 189 (2d Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). We agree, and apply Williams accordingly.

The transcript of the plea hearing reveals that Simmons, a twenty-nine-year-old high school graduate, understood the waiver provision in his plea agreement. In his plea agreement, Simmons specifically waived the right to challenge his sentence on appeal, reserving only the right to challenge an upward departure from the Guidelines range established at sentencing, and Simmons averred at his Rule 11 hearing that he read and understood the plea agreement. We therefore conclude that Simmons knowingly and intelligently waived the right to appeal his sentence. Turning to the scope of the waiver, the sentencing claims Simmons raises on appeal fall within the scope of the waiver provision. See id. at 169-70 (<HOLDING>).

What I\u2019m exceeded the bounds of its discretion when it, in effect, treated Ruperd\u2019s failure to appear as a waiver of his right to a hearing on his motion to suppress. The state contends that the district court never ruled on whether Ruperd was entitled to another hearing on his motion because Ruperd never brought another notice of hearing for the district court to deny. However, as we have previously noted, the district court unequivocally stated to Ruperd and his counsel on multiple occasions that the motion to suppress would not be reheard because Ruperd failed to appear, not because it was waiting for counsel to file a notice of hearing. The law does not require the doing of a useless thing. See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 777 F.2d 543, 554 (10th Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). We, consequently, conclude Ruperd was not holding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that the court correctly denied a mistrial when the statement that the witness saw the defendant when the defendant was signing in as a condition of bail was brief and added nothing to the governments caseholding that the defendants due process rights were violated when the trial judge singled out the only defense witness and indicated to that witness that he expected the witness to he and would personally ensure that the witness was prosecuted for perjury and thereby effectively drove that witness off the standholding that in order to show unavailability of a witness service of process by the defendant was not required when the witness had jumped bail and fledholding that death of potential alibi witness did not cause actual prejudice because defendant failed to relate the substance of the testimony of the missing witness in sufficient detail and to show witness testimony not available from other sources & \n\n289, 292 (5th Cir.1981)] or (3) when the government no longer has a mortgage or a lien upon the property in dispute when the suit was filed, [citing Koehler, 153 F.3d at 266-67].\u201d Hussain, 311 F.3d at 629-30. Furthermore, if the complaint or pleading does not set forth with particularity the nature of the government\u2019s interest showing that it has or claims to have a lien or mortgage against the property that is the subject of the suit, the complaint fails to satisfy the conditions necessary to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States and invoke federal jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(b) (\u201cThe complaint or pleading shall set forth with particularity the nature of the interest or lien of the United States.\u201d); see also Dahn v.

Against this background, the current proposals to authorize \"real time\u201d court reporters to provide \"unscoped\u201d transcripts for a fee seem odd indeed. They wholly misconceive real time court reporting as some sort of \u201cproduct,\u201d rather than the vital, justice-enhancing \u201cservice\u201d it is in fact. More importantly, unscoped transcripts can in no sense be said to be accurate \"records\u201d of the judicial proceedings.

[are] less likely a security.\" Hines explained in broad terms how those in the industry may characterize a transaction that is not clearly enumerated in the Securities Act as a security. Hines did not tell the jury that the transaction at issue was a security, couch his opinion specifically in terms of what is required under Utah law, or otherwise tell the jury what conclusion to reach. Compare, e.g., Larsen, 865 P.2d at 1861 & n. 10 (<HOLDING>), with Davis, 2007 UT App 18, \u00b617, 155 P.3d 909 holding that an expert that had provided consulting services to the defendant relating to the litigation was not precluded from serving as an expert for the plaintiffholding that an expert witnesss testimony on an ultimate issue was admissible recognizing that the expert did not specifically testify that the defendant was guilty or that as a matter of law the facts satisfied the applicable legal standardholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing plaintiffs expert witness to testify when it also allowed defendants expert witness who disputed the methodology used by plaintiffs expert to testifyholding that the admissibility of expert testimony was governed by state lawholding that an expert is not competent to testify as to statutory interpretation & \n\nthe underlying crimes. But a court also cannot be expected to accept wholesale unsubstantiated accusations of egregious police misconduct. This conclusion is not based on an unreasonable understanding of Strickland or an unreasonable view of the facts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Even if Bynum had testified, the only support for his claims of coercion would have been his own uncorroborated and self-serving testimony. He did not present any physical evidence of coercion or first-hand witness accounts of the interrogations. Without more support to Bynum\u2019s story, it was permissible for the state appellate court to conclude that there was not a reasonable probability that the trial court would have accepted By-num\u2019s version of events. See Mahaffey v. Page, 151 F.3d 671, 683-84 (7th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds by Mahaffey v. holding that testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress cannot be admitted as evidence of his guilt at trialholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that defendant had waived the opportunity for a suppression hearing on his confession by first moving to suppress the confession orally at the start of trial when no motion to suppress was filed no hearing requested and no objection to the admission of the statements was madeholding that when defendant failed to appear at scheduled suppression hearing the court could have decided the motion in defendants absence but it did not have the authority to refuse to consider itholding that consistent testimony given by three officers made it unlikely that defendants motion to suppress his confession as coerced would have been granted even though two witnesses to the interrogation had not testified at suppression hearingholding that petitioner was not prejudiced by counsels decision not to call sole witness to petitioners alleged beating at suppression hearing because testimony of arresting officers and assistant attorneys as well as absence of physical evidence of coercion made it unlikely that motion to suppress the confessions would have been granted & \n\nnot testify as a nonexpert fact witness about what he did and directly observed during the reenactment. Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\nwaives this privilege if he \u201cvoluntarily discloses or consents to disclosure of any significant part of the privileged matter.\u201d At trial, Ross testified extensively about what he said to his wife on the night of the shooting. This was clearly a voluntary disclosure of a \u201csignificant part of the privileged matter\u201d under Rule 504. We therefore agree with the State that Ross\u2019s testimony constituted a waiver of the Rule 504 privilege in this case. Furthermore, Ross could not use the trial court\u2019s initial ruling to exclude the marital communications as a means to commit perjury by way of a defense. The State was certainly entitled to cross-examine Ross as to his version of what he disclosed to his wife on the night of the shooting. See Rooks v. State, 250 Ark. 561, 466 S.W.2d 478 (1971) (<HOLDING>). We therefore affirm on this point. As for recognizing the importance of crossexamination in casting doubt on credibilityholding due process required an opportunity for crossexamination when the decision depended on the credibility of individual witness testimonyholding that it was permissible for the state to test the credibility of appellants trial testimony by crossexaminationholding that a trial witnesss testimony as to the credibility of another witness was prejudicial errorholding counsel was not deficient in not objecting to testimony that was permissible within state rules of evidence & \n\n731-32 (citing Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019). We observed in Haverty that a trial court has the discretion under West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-2 to determine whether immunity should be extended to a particular witness based on a determination \u201cthat the ends of justice may be promoted by compelling such testimony or evidence.\u201d 165 W.Va. at 172, 267 S.E.2d at 732. In this case, the trial court made the determination required by West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-2 that the interests of justice required a grant of immunity to Ms. Day so that she could freely offer her testimony without fear of additional prosecution for any events associated with the murder of the victim.

Urban was the first adult to whom an outcry statement was made who could remember J.C.\u2019s statement and relate it at trial. See Foreman v. State, 995 S.W.2d 854, 858-59 (Tex.App.-Austin 1999, pet. ref'd) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added). 2. Reliability of the outcry holding that article 38072 allows the first adult who can remember and relate at trial the childs statement to be the outcry witnessholding that the trial court did not err in allowing a witness to testify regarding the child victims hearsay statements prior to the child testifying because ocga 24316 allows testimony about a childs outofcourt statements even in cases when the child does not appear as a witness as long as the child is available at the trial to testifyholding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that admission of a witness prior identification statement where the witness could not remember the basis for the identification did not violate the confrontation clause or fedrevid 802holding tape recorded statement given to police shortly after criminal incident was inadmissible under section 908035 when witness did not remember its contents and did not testify that it correctly reflected her knowledge or that she tried to be truthful at the time she made the statement & \n\nserving a sentence.

(quoting United States v. Frierson, 945 F.2d 650, 658 (3d Cir.1991)). This is supported by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statements in Murphy.

Moreno, 102 F.3d 994, 997 (9th Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Becerra, 992 F.2d 960, 964 (9th Cir.1993)). Duenas-Gonzalez was not entitled to a new trial on his claimed Brady violation or on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Contrary to Duenas-Gonzalez\u2019s contention, no Brady violation occurred. The government offered neither false evidence nor perjured testimony. See United States v. Endicott, 869 F.2d 452, 455 (9th Cir.1989) (noting that the prosecution\u2019s inadvertent use of perjured testimony can constitute a Brady violation); Cf. United States v.

Nor did the government withhold evidence holding reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeholding that a new trial was warranted where there is reasonable probability that the false testimony introduced by the government influenced the outcome of the trialholding that there is a presumption that new evidence discovered by criminal defendant after trial is over would not change outcome of trialholding that petitioner failed to establish a reasonable probability that had his trial counsel interviewed renee and called her as a witness at trial the trial outcome would have been different because renees testimony wholly lacked credibilityholding that a reasonable probability is one that in the judgment of the reviewing court is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding citation omitted & \n\ndamage to the front end, and a broken steering wheel. Is this the damage which Dr. Brown says is essential to his opinion? What of damage to the frame and understructure of the car? If speed is to be based partially on the damage done to the vehicles, that damage must be ascertained by something more than looking at a picture of the exterior of the automobile. No case has been cited to us which is factually similar to the one now before us. However we find substantial support for the views here expressed in Twidwell v. Davidson, 54 Wash.2d 75, 338 P.2d 326, 329-332; Stephanofsky v. Hill, 136 Conn. 379, 71 A.2d 560, 561; Kale v. Douthitt, 4 Cir., 274 F.2d 476, 480-483 (dealing particularly with evidence as to the angle of impact); Levine v. Remolif, 80 Nev. 168, 390 P.2d 718, 719-721 (<HOLDING>); Anderson v. Broome, Tex.Civ.App., 233 S.W.2d holding trial court properly excluded testimony concerning speed of vehicle where witness observed vehicle travel on a diagonal for thirtyfive 35 feet on poorly lit road estimate of speed may not be predicated on such a slender data base holding that an experts opinion must be based on facts in evidence or within his or her knowledge and that the admission of an experts opinion is reviewed for an abuse of discretionholding that rules of evidence do not permit an expert to give opinion or state legal conclusions regarding a question of lawholding that a picture of a damaged vehicle was insufficient to permit an opinion of speed based on damage to the vehiclesrecognizing that a common illustration of an admissible opinion under rule 701 is an expression of opinion by a lay observer of a cars speed & \n\nthe only major issue was the identity of the robbers.\u201d Id. 21 .Similarly, if the defense indicates that it will present evidence during its case to impeach the testimony of a State witness (as in Milligan and Cobh), there is no concern that the State will not have the \"predicate issue\u201d to justify offering further evidence to refute the defense evidence during the State\u2019s rebuttal case. 22 . The legislature has established entrapment as an affirmative defense with the concomitant burden of proof on the defendant rather than as an element of an offense to be negated in the State\u2019s prima facie case. See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 432(a). 23 . Arguments by counsel during opening statements and summation are not evidence and thus cannot be said to raise an affirmative defense. Cf. Milligan 761 A.2d at 8 (<HOLDING>). 24 . Cf. United States v. Bailey, D.C.Cir., holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence where the evidence would serve only to impeach testimonyholding that evidence of a later sexual encounter that triggered the delayed report was admissible only after milligan had in fact introduced evidence of late reporting to impeach the victims testimonyholding that remedial measures evidence was not admissible to impeach testimony that at the time of the event the measure was not believed to be as practical as the one employedrecognizing that if the government introduced evidence tending to show that the victims did not expect to engage in prostitution it will have put those victims sexual histories at issue and under those circumstances it is possible that evidence rebutting the governments allegations might be admissible under the constitutional exceptionholding that evidence of prior uncharged sexual conduct with the victim is admissible to corroborate the victims testimony & \n\nof Mr. Boggess, Detective Burke did nothing more than identify the person depicted in the photographs, the car shown in the photographs, and the place where the photographs were taken. Further, Mr. Boggess testified that the photographs showed him partially undressing after being baptized. We simply cannot find any prejudicial impact from the manner in which the photographs were introduced, nor the substantive content of what the photographs depicted. Consequently, the erroneous admission of the photographs has been shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. IV. CONCLUSION In view of the foregoing, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Mr. Flippo\u2019s motion for a new trial. Affirmed. 1 . See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (<HOLDING>). 2 . The medication and clothing were recognizing that any witness has the right to refuse to be interviewed if he so desires and is not under or subject to legal processholding that if a suspect indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioningholding that prior to engaging in custodial interrogation police must warn a suspect that he has a right to remain silent that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney either retained or appointedholding that police may continue questioning a suspect until he unambiguously invokes his right to remain silentholding that a suspect must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law that he has the right to the presence of an attorney and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires & \n\nhis testimony to what she had told him about her condition and what she had told him about how she was feeling. He did not offer a medical opinion on what Guarilia's hostility, if true, could have done lo a person with diabetes and hypertension. He also offered no link between her depression and Guarilia\u2019s treatment. For all those reasons I do not believe Dr. Portnow's testimony carries any great weight. Michaud herself testified as to her condition, that is, that both her blood pressure and blood sugar level increased and that Guarilia\u2019s treatment depressed her. Because the evidence is in the record through Michaud, there is no need for me to rely on Dr. Portnow's report of the same information. 11 . See Priest v. Interco, Inc. (In re Interco), 135 B.R. 359, 361-62 (Bankr.E.D.Mo.1991) (<HOLDING>); accord Perino v.

Under the Rule, an owner\u2019s valuation testimony fulfills the same role that expert testimony does. See, e.g., Harris Cnty. Appraisal Dist. v. Riverway Holdings, L.P., No. 14-09-00786-CV, 2011 WL 529466, at *5, 2011 Tex.App. LEXIS 1047, at *13 (Tex.App.-Houston.[14th Dist.] Feb. 15, 2011, pet. denied) (observing that the Property Owner Rule \u201ctreats valuation testimony from a property owner as the functional equivalent of expert valuation testimony insofar as the owner\u2019s own property is concerned\u201d); cf. Fed.R.Evid. 702 advisory committee\u2019s note (<HOLDING>). Like expert testimony, landowner valuation holding that the prosecution could not retain as a testifying expert for trial a nontestifying expert the defendant had previously retainedholding that public policy militates against a judge testifying as an expert witness for one of the partiesholding that material for witnesses need not be produced to defendant where the witnesses were not called as government witnesses at trialholding any error in admitting testimony of expert witness was harmless because it was cumulative of same testimony given by six other expert witnesses who testified at trialholding that expert testimony rule includes skilled witnesses such as landowners testifying to land values & \n\nis common in adversary proceedings for expert witnesses to be present during the presentation of factual testimony so that they have a foundation on which to base their opinions. See, e.g., Federal Rule of Evidence 615. Although that Rule authorizes a district court to sequester witnesses to prevent them from hearing the testimony of other witnesses, it also provides several exceptions, including an exception for \u201ca person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3). The Advisory Committee notes specify that this exception contemplates \u201can expert needed to advise counsel in the management of the litigation.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3) Advisory Committee notes. See United States v. Mohney, 949 F.2d 1397, 1404-05 (6th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); Morvant v. Construction Aggregates Corp., 570 holding that a witness may testify about his subjective interpretation of a conversation in which he is participating as long as his opinion is rationally based on his perception and is helpful either to an understanding of his testimony or to the determination of a fact in issueholding that in order to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to call a witness to testify the claimant must allege 1 the identity of the potential witness 2 that the witness was available to testify at trial 3 the substance of the witnesss testimony and 4 an explanation of how the omission of the testimony prejudiced the caseholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing plaintiffs expert witness to testify when it also allowed defendants expert witness who disputed the methodology used by plaintiffs expert to testifyholding that the presence in the courtroom of an expert witness who does not testify to the facts of the case but rather gives his opinion based upon the testimony of others hardly seems suspect and will in most cases be beneficial for he will be more likely to base his expert opinion on a more accurate understanding of the testimony as it evolves before the juryholding that an expert witnesss testimony on an ultimate issue was admissible recognizing that the expert did not specifically testify that the defendant was guilty or that as a matter of law the facts satisfied the applicable legal standard & \n\n"}

Moreover, at the March 23, 2014 hearing on the State\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to charge her as a habitual offender, Nations\u2019s attorney specifically stated: \u2018Tour honor, we don\u2019t have any opposition [to the State\u2019s motion]. It\u2019s either \u2014 she\u2019s habitual or she\u2019s not. I think that we had already talked and she is in that status.\u201d After Nations\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement, the trial judge granted the State\u2019s motion. It is difficult to imagine a clearer waiver of the issue. Thus, Nations\u2019s claim of unfair surprise is not only without merit but also procedurally barred. Newberry v. State, 85 So.3d 884, 888 (\u00b6 8) (Miss.Ct.App.2011) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we find no error in the trial holding that a noticebased objection to a motion to amend an indictment to charge the defendant as a habitual offender is waived if the defendant fails to make a specific and contemporaneous objectionholding that an objection was adequate when the judge cut short the objection and the defendant was not afforded the opportunity to explain his objection fullyholding a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate reviewholding that a party fails to preserve an evidentiary issue for appeal not only by failing to make a specific objection but also by making the wrong specific objectionholding that defendant waived his objection to the prosecutors use of her peremptory challenges by failing to make a contemporaneous objection during jury selection & \n\nin the trial court on the grounds now asserted, defendant is deemed to have waived the objection on appeal. CRE 103; People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965 (Colo.App.1983). Kruse, 819 P.2d at 551 (Van Cise, J., dissenting). We agree with Judge Van Cise. The protection provided by section 16-8-107(1) should not have been addressed by the court of appeals. The general rule is that failure to make a timely and sufficient objection during the trial constitutes a waiver of that ground on appeal. Larkin v. People, 177 Colo. 156, 160, 493 P.2d 1, 3 (1972); People v. Browning, 809 P.2d 1086, 1088 (Colo.App.1990). Kruse waived his objection to the admission of Ortiz\u2019s testimony under section 16-8-107(1) by failing to properly object at trial. People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965, 966-67 (Colo.App.1983) (<HOLDING>). An exception to the general rule exists, holding that defendant must have clearly objected at trial to the matter he is raising on appealholding that appellate court could not consider objection to testimony when defendant objected at trial on different groundsholding that error was preserved when defendant objected to question regarding defendant was under arrest immediately following question about postarrest event sufficient to put trial court on notice of appellants state constitutional grounds for objectionholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewholding that claims based on grounds not objected to at trial cannot be considered on appeal & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\n496, 745 P.2d 717, 721 (Ct.App. 1987). In this case, Plaintiff filed a pretrial motion to exclude the assailant from being considered a concurrent tortfeasor. The motion cited Lujan v. Healthsouth Rehabilitation Gorp., 120 N.M. 422, 902 P.2d 1025 (1995), the same authority Plaintiff relies on in this appeal. Plaintiff thus fairly invoked a ruling of the trial court on this issue and preserved it for appeal. See id. (explaining liabilities of concurrent and successive tortfeasors). {36} We are unpersuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to preserve this issue by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on comparative negligence. In so contending, Defendants rely on Pittard v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 101 N.M. 723, 729, 688 P.2d 333, 339 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>), and Romero v. Mervyn\u2019s, 109 N.M. 249, 253 n. holding that a party waived an allegation that an instruction was erroneous where the party failed to object at trial to the instruction on those groundsholding that party waived an objection to choice of lawholding defendant waived complaintholding that party waived public policy challenge by failing to raise it during arbitrationholding that party waived complaint regarding instruction where it did not raise specific objection & \n\nfrom the plaintiffs expert that the cost to replace the items taken from the facility \u201cwould have been nearly $300,000.\u201d In addition, the jury cannot be faulted for using replacement cost as the measure of recovery. Evidence of the replacement cost was admitted, and the jurors were simply instructed that, if they determined the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the property, they were also to \u201cdetermine the value of that property as of the date of trial.\u201d They were not instructed that \u201cvalue\u201d meant market value, not replacement cost. Under these circumstances, we do not believe the jury\u2019s award of replacement cost at a level proposed by the plaintiffs expert was so far outside the range of evidence as to suggest the jury was motivated by passion. See Schmitt, 170 N.W.2d at 660-61 (<HOLDING>). A similar view can be reasonably taken of the holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial courtholding that appellate courts determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction based on a review of all of the evidence admitted at trialholding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objectionholding new trial cannot be based on claim of prejudice arising from jurys reliance on evidence admitted without objectionholding any error in admission of evidence cured when same evidence later admitted without objection & \n\nwas granted \u2014 that the submission date had been re-set to March 18 made it impossible for plaintiffs to file controverting evidence.\u201d Thus, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the trial court did not re-set the submission date for the Motion to March 18 is contradicted by the Insureds themselves. In addition, the Insureds\u2019 assertion in their motion for rehearing that they had insufficient notice of the trial court\u2019s resetting of the submission date is not a basis for granting rehearing because it is well-established that, if the trial court did not give sufficient notice in this regard, the Insureds had to raise this complaint in the trial court. See Okonkwo v. Washington Mut. Bank, No. 14-05-00925-CV, 2007 WL 763821, at *2 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] Mar. 15, 2007, no pet.) (mem.op.) (<HOLDING>); Babajide v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., holding that appellant who properly filed an objection in accordance with the notice he received from the trial court had standing to appealholding that parties waived any choice of law objection by not raising an objectionholding appellant waived his complaint that trial court gave him no notice of submission date for summaryjudgment motion by not raising the objection in the trial courtholding that once a trial court has set a date for a summaryjudgment hearing the court must allow the nonmoving party an opportunity to be heardholding that if appellant preserves legal sufficiency complaint in motion for new trial new trial is all the relief appellate court can give because that is all the relief appellant requested in trial court & \n\nPlaintiff, need not specifically reference the FMLA when requesting FMLA leave, she must put the University on notice that her request is for FMLA leave. The undersigned finds that Plaintiff did not request FMLA leave in her letter dated March 21,' 2011, but only suggested that she might need to take leave. The purpose .of the letter was to request an extension of her review which Plaintiff was previously advised could be denied. Based on the undisputed facts of the record, no FMLA violation has been demonstrated, and certainly, no willful or reckless violation of the FMLA is presented. As such, summary judgment should be granted on Count V as well using either of the dates that Plaintiff submits. III. RECOMMENDATION Based on the foregoing, the undersigned recommends t (11th Cir. 2013) (<HOLDING>). RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED at Fort Lauderdale, holding that the failure to object to the magistrate judges report releases the court from its duty to independently review the motionholding that under current eleventh circuit rule the failure to object limits the scope of our appellate review to plain error review of the magistrate judges factual findings however failure to object to the magistrate judges legal conclusions does not preclude the party from challenging those conclusions on appealholding failure to timely object to magistrate judges recommendation waives appellate review of factual and legal questionsholding that under the firm waiver rule a party who fails to make a timely objection to the magistrate judges findings and recommendations waives appellate review of both factual and legal questionsholding that failure to object to magistrate judges recommendation waived issue on appeal & \n\ntrigger CERCLA liability, nor does actual disposal of hazardous substances. A release must occur or be threatened before CERCLA is triggered. A party that \u201carranged for disposal\u201d of a hazardous substance under \u00a7 9607(a)(3) does not become hable un der CERCLA until there is an actual or threatened release of that substance into the environment. Arranging for disposal of hazardous substances, in itself, is neither regulated under nor prohibited by CERCLA. Further, disposal activities that were legal when conducted can nevertheless give rise to liability under \u00a7 9607(a)(3) if there is an actual or threatened release of such hazardous substances into the environment. See Cadillac Fairview\/California, Inc. v. United States (Cadillac Fairview\/California I), 41 F.3d 562, 565-66 (9th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>); Cadillac Fairview\/California, Inc. v. Dow holding that a party that sold a product to another party arranged for disposal of a hazardous substanceholding past owners liable for the disposal of hazardous wastes that leaked from an underground storage tankholding that the party prevailing on the significant issues in the litigation is the party that should be considered the prevailing party for attorneys feesholding that arranger liability claim requires proof that defendant arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances owned or possessed by defendantholding that in a situation where the police have probable cause to arrest one party and reasonably mistake a second party for that first party the arrest of the second party is still a valid arrest & \n\nclaims are defaulted, but Louisiana prisoners can benefit from the Martinez\/Trevino exception to the procedural-default, rule if they can show that they have a substantial IATC claim and received IAC from state habeas counsel. As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v. Woodard, 9 So.3d 112, 118 (La. 2009) holding court unable to rule on issue when the record fails to include copies of the evidence needed to decide issue on appealholding that an issue not raised on appeal is waivedholding issue not raised in the bankruptcy court was waived on appealholding that if the record discloses evidence needed to decide the issue of iac and that issue was raised by assignment of error on appeal it can be decided on appeal in the interest of judicial economyholding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it & \n\nfactors, the Burnet court relied on Snedigar, which had in turn relied on Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. 223. The Snedigar court\u2019s holding (with the Burnet court\u2019s deletions italicized) is as follows: We . . . hold that when a trial judge chooses one of the harsher remedies allowable under CR 37(b), the reasons for that choice should he clearly stated on the record. We further hold that when the most severe sanction of default or dismissal is ordered, it must be apparent from the record that the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed, and whether it found the Associated Mortgage due process factors [of willfulness and substantial prejudice] to be present. 53 Wn. App. at 487 (emphasis added); Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. at 228-29 (<HOLDING>). The Burnet court also cited a line of cases holding that a trial court had the authority to impose a default judgment as a sanction for violating a rule 16 scheduling order pursuant to rule 37b2 stating we agree with the basic premise that a default sanction can under certain circumstances be an appropriate response to a violation of a rule 16 order after all the express terms of rule 37 permit a trial court to impose sanctions when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discoveryholding that district courts order granting motion for default judgment was erroneous because a default judgment cannot be entered until the amount of damages has been ascertained holding that a postjudgment contempt sanction for refusal to obey orders whether it is characterized as a civil or a criminal sanction is immediately appealable as a final order under 1291recognizing that courts have discretion to exclude evidence as a sanction for violation of a discovery orderholding that the sanction of a default judgment authorized by cr 37b2c is a harsh remedy which should only be granted where there has been a willful or deliberate refusal to obey a discovery order which refusal substantially prejudices the opponents ability to prepare for trial & \n\nto the First Complaint except for some minor additional language added to Count II. Majority Opinion \u00b6 3. The modified claims were fully addressed by Judge Robinson and I agree with his analysis and the dismissal of Plaintiffs\u2019 Second Complaint under Rule 1-012(B)(6). The minor wording modification made to Count II did not establish an issue of fact regarding whether Plaintiffs\u2019 individual loan under Count II was preempted under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. Plaintiffs have failed to provide this Court with any authority to support their position that a personal loan impacting their business relationships and commercial credit avoids preemption under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. See Jojola v. Fresenius Med. Clinic, 2010-NMCA-101, \u00b6 7, 149 N.M. 51, 243 P.3d 755 (<HOLDING>). As a result, the rewording of Count II was recognizing that where a party fails to provide any authority for an argument we will presume that none existsholding that an issue is waived when a party fails to provide adequate citation to authorityholding that when a district court fails to provide reasons for imposing special conditions and the defendant fails to object we review for plain errorholding that a party waives an argument if the party fails to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support of the argumentholding when a party fails to provide arguments or supporting authority for his assertion the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v. Thompson, 710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983))); McRae v. United States, 420 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\n\u201c(I)ssue preclusion requires that the party against whom issue preclusion is asserted in the present action was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.\u201d TLT Const. v. A. Anthony Tappe & Assoc., 48 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 5 (1999). M. and J. filed the application for criminal process against Benoit in the Leominster District Court on February 14, 1997, and thus were plainly parties in the district court adjudication. To establish S. was in privity with M. and J., there \u201chas to be a \u2018sufficient legal identity\u2019 between the interest of the person allegedly represented and the prior litigant for the later claim to be precluded.\u201d Mongeau v. Boutelle, 10 Mass.App.Ct. 246, 250 (1980) (citation omitted). See Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-Operative Bank, 7 Mass.App.Ct. 153, 158 (1979) (<HOLDING>). A \u201cnonparty to a prior adjudication can be holding that the current party was sufficiently identified with the parties to the prior litigationholding that prevailing party was entitled to attorneys fees under an option contract which had expired prior to litigation because the parties were litigating their performance under the terms of the contractholding that the party prevailing on the significant issues in the litigation is the party that should be considered the prevailing party for attorneys feesholding that a judgment as to the title in a prior litigation was not subject to collateral attackholding res judicata did not bar current litigation when prior litigation between the parties involved one breach of obligation under a joint venture agreement and instant litigation was based upon a different cause of action from a subsequent interference with the same agreement & \n\nif the jury posed a question about insurance during deliberations. Evidence of insurance is generally not admissible at trial unless it is offered for a purpose permitted by Federal Rule of Evidence 411. See also Piontkowski v. Scott, 65 Ohio App.3d 4, 582 N.E.2d 1002, 1003-04 (1989). Gratzianna\u2019s brief reference to \u201cCincinnati Insurance\u201d was inadvertent and unresponsive to the question Chapman\u2019s counsel asked. \u25a0 Counsel hurriedly diverted the jury\u2019s attention from the comment and, unlike the cases on which defendants rely, defense counsel did not ask the court contemporaneously to strike the witness\u2019s remark and instruct the jury to disregard it, nor did counsel ask for an immediate curative instruction. Cf. e.g., Kaltrider v. YMCA of Cleveland, Ohio, 457 F.2d 768, 770 (6th Cir.1972) (<HOLDING>); Davis v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 967 F.2d holding the lack of a contemporaneous objection could not be salvaged by a motion for a mistrialholding no prejudice occurred where party made contemporaneous objection to brief remark about insurance during closing argument and court gave cautionary instructionholding a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate reviewholding that when no objection was made to jury instruction evidence to support finding based on instruction should be assessed in light of the instruction givenholding mistrial unwarranted where contemporaneous objection was made to single mention of insurance and court gave cautionary instruction & \n\nlawful police power because City\u2019s billboard ordinance is unconstitutionally unreasonable because it does not further public welfare, health, or safety. Lamar\u2019s pleadings (including its summary judgment pleadings) did not challenge the constitutionality of City\u2019s billboard ordinance on this or any other basis. Lamar\u2019s further contention that City never formally declared the Agreement to be adverse to its interests and never officially repudiated the Agreement preserves nothing for our review. Lamar does not explain the legal relevance of this fact, and provides no authority explaining why the fact prevented the trial court from determining that the Agreement was void ab initio pursuant to section 432.070 because it exceeded the scope of City\u2019s powers. Ad Trend, 272 S.W.3d at 206-07 (<HOLDING>). Lamar\u2019s fourth point on appeal next argues holding that an appellate court is not required to review an appellants point relied on which appears without citation of applicable or relevant authorityholding that a claim is waived on appeal when not supported by citation to relevant authorityholding that issues raised but not supported by argument are deemed abandonedholding an issue is deemed abandoned and will not be considered on appeal if the argument is raised in a brief but not supported by authorityholding that pejorative allegations about questioned actions where the legal significance is not explained nor supported by relevant authority or by an explanation for the lack of relevant authority are deemed abandoned and unpreserved for appellate review & \n\nreceive sufficient advance written notice of the charges against him. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-64, 94 S.Ct. 2963. The notice provided to Mr. Firth was quite extensive and detailed. It stated generally that Mr. Firth was recommended for termination from treatment because he had \u201cdemonstrated a lack of progress in treatment, a lack of motivation for treatment, and a failure to meet program expectations.\u201d R. at 567. The notice then included five single-spaced pages of detailed facts supporting these conclusions. Mr. Firth argues that the notice nonetheless provided insufficient factual detail because it failed to cite program rules or standards upon which the charges were based. But he cites no authority for this proposition. See Phillips v. Calhoun, 956 F.2d 949, 953-54 (10th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Nor does he explain why he was unable to holding that a party waives an argument if the party fails to elaborate or provide any citation of authority in support of the argumentholding party must support argument with legal authorityholding appellate court need not consider argument where party has failed to support it with any authority legal or otherwiseholding that an appellant waived a claim where he failed to cite any legal authority in support of an argument in his appellate briefholding an argument waived for failure to cite authority & \n\nso that Plaintiff could attend medical appointments (Id. at 37, 39); (3) former supervisor Jose So-mohano denied Plaintiffs request to leave early during a bleeding emergency because he did not have a cashier to replace Plaintiff (Id. at 43, 74); and (4) Betty Montano denied Plaintiffs request for a part-time accommodation as ordered by Plaintiffs doctor (Id. at 43-44). Defendants argue that there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding these allegations because Plaintiffs assertions are inadmissible hearsay and because Plaintiff failed to create a nexus between the discriminatory acts she described and her alleged termination. Defendants fail on both accounts. Plaintiffs assertions are not hearsay. See Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1094-1095 (1st Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, Plaintiff does not need to show holding that in employees age discrimination suit against former employer supervisors statement to employee was not hearsay even though the statement was offered for its truth because the statement was an admission by a party opponentholding that a text message constituted hearsay insofar as it was offered to prove the truth of the statement assertedholding that the district courts improper admission of an unauthenticated registration statement was harmless because the proponent of the registration statement later properly authenticated the statement in a motion to reconsiderholding that defendant who introduced hearsay statement waived objection to admission of another part of same statementholding that a hearsay statement can itself be considered in first determining if a conspiracy existed when the statement was made & \n\n\u201cregardless of whether the respondent has been tried, acquitted, or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense.\u201d This language makes it clear that a disciplinary violation premised on a violation of law is separate from the initiation or outcome of criminal proceedings based on the same conduct. Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla. Bar v. Brown, 905 So.2d 76, 81 (Fla.2005); see also Fla. Bar v. Riggs, 944 So.2d 167, 171 (Fla.2006) (<HOLDING>); Fla. Bar v.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The judge is not to \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient \u201cevidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. B. Brentwood has not waived its 2 S.Ct. 775, 31 L.Ed.2d 124 (1972) (<HOLDING>); K.M.C. Co. v. Irving Trust Co., 757 F.2d 752, holding a judgment in the absence of notice violates due process rightsholding that there is no due process right to appellate reviewholding that a cognovit clause which provided for judgment without notice or hearing was not unconstitutional per se because due process rights are subject to waiverholding that where there is no unequal bargaining power or overreaching debtors can voluntarily intelligently and knowingly waive due process rights by signing a cognovit note which is an agreement by which a debtor consents in advance to a holders obtaining a judgment without notice or hearingholding that an individual can waive any process to which he or she has a right & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given.

Accordingly, Durham\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees is denied. VII. Conclusion 98. On Plaintiffs claims under \u00a7 113(f)(1) of CERCLA, the Court awards Plaintiff, The Durham Manufacturing Company, $116,075.65 against Defendant Merriam Manufacturing Company, and $19,345.94 against Defendant Allan E.

The Court further awards Plaintiff pre-judgment interest, accruing from the latter of the date on which Plaintiff made demand for payment on the Defendants or the date of the expenditure.

The Plaintiff is directed to submit a holding that prejudgment interest may include compound interestholding that award and rate of prejudgment interest are within trial courts discretionholding that an award of prejudgment interest under 113f of cercla is mandatoryholding that the state circuit court did not have the authority to award prejudgment interest for matters occurring prior to arbitration awardholding summary rejection of request for interest was not an abuse of discretion under indcode 345147 which states the court may award prejudgment interest as part of a judgment & \n\npublic interest.\u201d Administrative agencies are far better suited than \u00e1re courts to make determinations based on the broad policy question of what is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Third, \u00a7 925(c) contains a restriction on the consideration of new evidence by the district courts, stating; \u201cThe court may in its discretion admit additional evidence where failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d This constraint on the admission of evidence suggests that the initial adjudication of applications is limited to the Secretary of the Treasury. We therefore conclude that Congress in tended for district court review to be contingent on an initial consideration of an application by the Secretary. See Saccacio v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 211 F.3d 102, 104 (4th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Owen v.

Although respondent expressly declared to the employee that it was \u201creserving\u201d the issue of jurisdiction for determination, it chose nevertheless to join with the employee in submitting the grievance question for independent review. Under these circum stances, in spite of its assertion of reserved powers, the county elected the process for determining the dispute. See Helmerichs v.

Thus, we will decide only whether the arbitration clauses are unconscionable. To determine what state\u2019s law applies to the question of unconscionability, we use Delaware law, pursuant to the choice of law provisions in the CMAs. See Overstreet, 462 F.3d at 411-12 (applying a choice of law provision to determine the law governing the unconscionability of an arbitration clause in a case where both the arbitration clause and the agreement as a whole were attacked as unconscionable); DeSantis v.

In any event, under this Court\u2019s holding that attorney fee awards are payable to the attorney, not the plaintiff, the awards are the property of the attorney and therefore not subject to offset for the plaintiffs debts. See Marr\u00e9, 117 F.3d at 304 (finding that \u201cthe government cannot set off [the plaintiffs] tax obligations against the attorneys\u2019 fee award, as no mutuality of debt exists between the government and [the plaintiffs] attorneys\u201d). Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel Is Entitled to an Additional Fee Award This Court further finds that the plaintiffs attorney is entitled to an additional fee award under the EAJA for his time spent litigating this issue. See Commissioner, 496 U.S. 154 at 160-161, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (<HOLDING>). The Government recognizes that this Court has holding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that eaja fees may be awarded for fee litigation without a separate finding that the government was not substantially justified in its position as to the fee litigation as the single finding that the governments position lacks substantial justification operates as a onetime threshold for fee eligibility and presumptively encompasses all aspects of the civil actionholding that where a contract for legal services fails to expressly provide for the amount of the fee a reasonable fee is impliedholding that awarded fees were reasonable and that proof that attorneys fees are necessary apart from testimony as to the reasonableness of the fee is not requiredholding that the termination of the fee cap did not affect litigation in progress when the fee cap was in effect & \n\nof the United States, for or relating to any act under color of office or in the performance of his duties.... 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442. Thus, to invoke the federal officer removal statute, Thornburg must both act under an officer of the United States and have averred a colorable federal defense. See Mesa, 489 U.S. at 133-34, 109 S.Ct. 959. We address each of these requirements in turn. 1. Whether Thornburg \u201cact[s] under\u201d an officer of the United States such that removal under the federal officer removal statute is available to him Bell argues that this Court should remand her claim to state court because, based on this Court\u2019s decision in Cromelin, Thornburg cannot take advantage of the federal officer removal statute and remove the case under \u00a7 1442(a)(1). See Cromelin, 177 F.2d at 277 (<HOLDING>). Thornburg, however, claims that he is holding that a section 1983 suit against an officer in his or her official capacity is simply another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agentholding that a bankruptcy trustee is an officer of the court appointed by the court directed by the court and paid by the court but is in no sense an agent or employee or officer of the united statesholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decideholding that an officer or employee of the tennessee valley authority was not an officer or employee acting under the authority of the united states or any department or any officer of the government thereof within the meaning of a criminal statute first enacted in 1884recognizing that this court and the united states supreme court have embraced the notion that so long as the sentence imposed is within the maximum limit set by the legislature an appellate court is without power to review the sentence & \n\nthe plaintiff was financially able to retain an attorney this was a \"special circumstance\u201d that would allow the court to deny it an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the matter with some instructions. On remand the Chancery Court determined that the ability to pay attorney\u2019s fees was not an appropriate special circumstance; thus, Wilmington Materials was entitled to and awarded attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988. 17 .2000 WL 1724326, 2000 Del.

(<HOLDING>); and Wilmington Materials II, 1994 WL 384458, holding that an award of attorneys fees under supreme court rule 38 precursor to rule 222 did not preempt an award of attorneys fees to which one is otherwise entitled and thus appellant could seek an award of attorneys fees pursuant to section 1577300 which permits an award of fees for a party prevailing in an action against a state agencyholding that although plaintiff was entitled to fees under 1988 there were special circumstances which allowed the chancellor in his discretion to deny an awardholding that a pro se litigant who is an attorney is not entitled to fees under 1988holding that under 42 usc 1988 which allows the award of attorneys fees in a civil rights action under 1983 a prevailing plaintiff should ordinarily recover an attorneys fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust quoting srep no 941011 p 4 1976holding that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny an award of attorneys fees to the wife & \n\nnegotiations in good faith, sending them to binding arbitration instead. In addition, the arbitration provision is intended to apply even if, as here, one of the parties continues to be represented by the same counsel who represented that party in the settlement negotiations, contravening the letter and intent of the public policy of Texas as stated in sections 1.101 and 6.603 of the Family Code. Thus, even if I had not concluded that the entire Agreement was void, I would hold that the inclusion of an arbitration provision in the parties cooperative law agreement violates the letter and the spirit of sections 1.101 and 6.603 of the Family Code and that the provision is void an unenforceable as against the public policy of the State of Texas. See In re Poly-America, 262 S.W.3d at 348 (<HOLDING>).

Ah appropriate regard for the delicate balance between state and national judicial authority counsels that, insofar as feasible, decisions relating to the jurisdiction and remedial capacity of the Delaware state courts \u2014 decisions central to the resolution of this case \u2014 be made by the Delaware courts themselves. (c) Our concern about the remedy available in the Delaware courts arises in part from the potential tension between the decision of the Court of Chancery in Delaware Bankers Ass\u2019n v.

Rather, because Kleiner\u2019s opinion does not proffer any specialized knowledge, and invokes legal standards (\u25a0ie., that defendants could have accommodated plaintiffs disability without significant impact, and that defendants retaliated against plaintiff), his opinion would \u201cnot aid the jury in making a decision, but rather attempts to substitute [his] judgment for the jury\u2019s.\u201d See United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 102 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen this occurs, the expert acts outside of his limited role of providing the groundwork in the form of an opinion to enable the jury to make its own informed determination.\u201d); see also Hygh v.

The only Eleventh Amendment question here is whether the Holmes County Court, which is responsible for the policies of its Clerk\u2019s Office and Judge Irving, should be considered an \u201carm of the state\u201d and thus vested with sovereign immunity. We do not write on a blank slate. Several years ago, we held that an Ohio court of common pleas was an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. See Mumford v.

Dep\u2019t of Treasury, State of Mich., Revenue Div., 987 F.2d 376, 381 (6th Cir.1993). Because Kentucky has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and Congress has not abrogated state sovereign immunity under sections 1981 and 1983 or any other federal statute cited by Sefa, his claims against the Cabinet cannot proceed.

But despite the constitutional requirement that there be a remedy, the Supreme Court expressly noted in Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 115 S.Ct. 547, 130 L.Ed.2d 454 (1994), that \u201cthe sovereign immunity [that] States enjoy in federal court, under the Eleventh Amendment, does generally bar tax refund claims from being brought in that forum.\u201d Id. at 110, 115 S.Ct. 547 (second emphasis added). To ensure that taxpayers possess an avenue for relief, the Court held that state courts must hear suits to recover taxes unlawfully exacted, the \u201csovereign immunity [that] States traditionally enjoy in their own courts notwithstanding.\u201d Id.; cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 740, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (<HOLDING>). Reasoning analogously, we conclude that the holding that in statute authorizing suits against united states limits time period in which such suits may be brought united states retains its sovereign immunity as to any suits brought outside of that time period therefore court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over suit against united states that is barred by statute of limitationsholding that congress has power to subject the states to wage and hour regulationholding that congress did not properly abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity from suits under the patent actholding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that congress cannot subject states to suits in state courts but taking care not to overrule reich & \n\n(2) and (3) of 9006(b) set forth certain exceptions. Paragraph 2 enumerates the bankruptcy rules for which enlargement is not permitted and paragraph 3, which includes Rule 4007(c), enumerates the bankruptcy rules for which enlargement of time is limited to the \u201cextent and under the conditions stated in those rules.\u201d Fed. R.Bankr.P. 9006(b)(3). Although Rule 4007(c) permits a court to extend the time to file a complaint under \u00a7 523(c), the motion to extend must be filed before the time has expired. Accordingly, the Court does not have the discretion to allow an untimely complaint under any of the sections set forth in \u00a7 523(c) on the basis of excusable neglect. See In re Tucker, 263 B.R. 632, 636-637 (Bankr.M.D.Fla.2001). See also Byrd v. Alton, 837 F.2d 457, 459 (11th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>). Courts may nonetheless permit a late filed holding that a motion to continue a hearing on a postjudgment motion was ineffective to extend the period for the trial court to rule on the motion absent the express consent of the partiesholding creditors actual notice of chapter 7 case in ample time to prepare and timely file the necessary request for determination of dischargeability bars them from challenging the dischargeability of their claim 15 months after bar dateholding that the district court cannot extend the time for filing a rule 59e motion by margin orderholding that motion to extend time period for filing dischargeability complaint must be made before the running of that period and that court lacks discretion to grant late filed motion to extend time to file dischargeability complaintholding that a second motion to reconsider served within ten days of the denial of the first motion does not extend the time period for filing a notice of appeal from the underlying judgment & \n\neither be on the persons of the assailants or about the premises where they lived.\u201d). Second, Chambers argues that the police exceeded their authority under the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8953, thereby invalidating the search warrant, because the shooting occurred in Harrisburg, was investigated by Harrisburg police, and Harrisburg police obtained the search warrant, but the warrant was approved by a Swatara magistrate and executed in Swatara Township. Even if Chambers\u2019s interpretation of the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act were correct, however, he does not explain how a violation of state law would be relevant to the federal constitutional analysis required here. Cf Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 176-78, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008) (<HOLDING>).

First, Primus and Button are concerned only with the solicitation and financing of good faith claims. Here, the Plaza defendants are alleged to have solicited numerous baseless suits by the landowners. Second, the First Amendment does not shield such improper practices in the solicitation and representation of clients as occurred here. See Primus, supra, 436 U.S. at 426 and 439, 98 S.Ct. at 1901 and 1908; cf. Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, 436 U.S. 447, 449, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 1915, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978) (<HOLDING>). In this regard, we note that it is relevant holding that a state agency created under state law was a state actorholding that under article i section 9 a person has no constitutionally protected privacy interest in abandoned propertyholding a state constitutionally may discipline a lawyer for soliciting clients in person under circumstances likely to pose dangers that the state has a right to preventholding that the federal due process clause protects a state employee who under state law has a legitimate claim of entitlement to state employmentholding that the state police is a state agency & \n\nprotection of the laws. The district court then stated, however, that \u201c[b]efore there can be any liability under section 1983, there must be \u2018a direct causal link\u2019 between the personal conduct of Deputy Lopez or the municipal conduct of Sonoma County and the alleged constitutional deprivation, in this case the murder of Mar g that \u201cour first inquiry in any case alleging mu nicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 is the question whether there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation\u201d); Kibbe, 480 U.S. at 267, 107 S.Ct. 1114 (stating that \u201cthe Court repeatedly has stressed the need to find a direct causal connection between municipal conduct and the constitutional deprivation\u201d) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); Harris, 664 F.2d at 1125 (<HOLDING>) (footnote omitted). Neither court has used the holding that individuals can be held liable under 1981 only when they have been personally involved or directly participated in the discriminationholding that even a temporary deprivation of first amendment rights constitutes irreparable harmholding that liability under 1983 can be established by showing that the defendants either personally participated in a deprivation of the plaintiffs rights or caused such a deprivation to occurholding that liability under 1983 requires a causal link to and direct responsibility for the deprivation of rightsholding that a superior can be held liable in his individual capacity if he participated in the deprivation of a plaintiffs constitutional rights & \n\n(7)(f) or other discovery under N.D.R.Crim.P. 16, but the defendant is not under obligation to do so. The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v. Anderson, 303 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1981) (<HOLDING>). The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\nothers] under the age of 30 ... who came to the United States under the age of sixteen\u201d without authorization and meet certain other criteria.

City of Hazleton, 620 F.3d 170, 221 (3d Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>), vacated on other grounds, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. holding that municipal ordinance was preempted by frsa and void under supremacy clauseholding city ordinance preempted by state law because ordinance prohibited act specifically allowed under state lawholding preempted municipal housing ordinance that would effectively remove persons from the city based on a snapshot of their current immigration status rather than based on a federal order of removalrecognizing that old chief was based entirely on the federal rules of evidence rather than the constitutionholding that a local ordinance prohibiting rental housing for illegal aliens was not field preempted and did not conflict with the federal removal process and where the ordinance specified it did not prohibit conduct expressly permitted by federal law did not conflict with federal antiharboring law & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); see also State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 430, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, this Court has held that [\u0430] holding that juveniles request for parent is invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that a suspects invocation of the right to remain silent must be unequivocal to require that police questioning ceaserecognizing two aspects to assertion of fifth amendment rights 1 a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand request was made for an attorney and 2 the request was for assistance with a custodial interrogation not for subsequent hearings or proceedingsholding a juveniles request to speak to a probation officer is not a per se invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that an unequivocal invocation of the fifth amendment right to counsel must be presented in a manner that a reasonable police officer under similar circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for the presence of an attorney & \n\nits immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one. Although a State\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity may subject it to suit in state court, it is not enough to waive the immunity guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment .... In the absence of an unequivocal waiver specifically applicable to federal-court jurisdiction, we decline to find that [a state] has waived its constitutional immunity.\u201d); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halder-man, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (Powell, J.) (\u201c[A] State\u2019s constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely whether it may be sued, but where it may be sued.\u201d) (emphasis in original); Serrano v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Conservation, 12-CV-1592 (MAD) (CFH), 2013 WL 6816787 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2013) (<HOLDING>); Smith v. State Univ. of New York, No. holding that utah did not waive its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to a suit brought in federal court because state statute provided for exclusive original jurisdiction in its own courtsholding that new mexico did not waive eleventh amendment immunity by engaging in activities and entering contracts subject to federal regulationholding that the nyshrl does not waive the new yorks eleventh amendment immunity to suit in federal courtholding that state did not waive eleventh amendment immunity by removing case to federal courtholding that state defendant waived eleventh amendment immunity to a federal claim by removing to federal court & \n\nas the starting date for calculating Gasser\u2019s delay in filing suit. Thus, although the court credited Gasser\u2019s testimony at least to the extent that this meeting took place, it failed to draw reasonable inferences in favor of Gasser about what took place during this encounter. Given Gasser\u2019s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome. See, e.g., Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia s.p.a., 944 F.2d 870, 878-79, 20 USPQ2d 1045, 1052 (Fed.Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). Alternatively, based on Gasser\u2019s testimony holding based on similar facts and a delay of three and onehalf years that it would have been an abuse of discretion for the district court to have held that these circumstances resulted in lachesholding abuse of discretion is established if district court decision was based on an error of lawholding that delay for three and onehalf years was unreasonable under rule 60b6holding a three and onehalf year delay was unreasonableholding district court abused discretion in denying leave to amend complaint to add count when no prejudice resulted from two and onehalf year delay and facts underlying new and old counts were similar & \n\nreferrals to specialists\u2014 the discrimination provision is sufficiently clear in apprising physicians that they may not provide firearm-owning patients with less medical care than they would other patients, in any circumstances. Thus, the discrimination provision of the Act is not vague. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the harassment provision of the Act, \u00a7 709.338(6), is vague because the Act does not define \u201cunnecessarily harassing.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that patients may hold diverse views as to what constitutes unnecessary harassment. Plaintiffs argue that what conduct is prohibited thus depends on what a particular patient understands it to be, and that the resulting uncertainty as to what the Act prohibits \u201cis not permissible under the First Amendment.\u201d See Conant, 309 F.3d at 639 (<HOLDING>) (citing Collins, 323 U.S. at 535, 65 S.Ct. at holding that where the first amendment does not protect a certain activity there can be no first amendment right of association to engage in that activityholding a statute providing for administrative action against physicians who engage in speech that the patient believes to be a recommendation of marijuana lacks the requisite narrow specificity under the first amendmentholding statute criminalizing speech intended to influence a juror did not violate the first amendmentholding that first amendment protections apply to compelled speech as well as restrictions on speechholding that possession of marijuana is not protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment & \n\n(Doc. # 1-6 at 2.) Thus, Plaintiff was eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. Plaintiff brought this suit, accusing seven Defendants of eight causes of action\u2014 three claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and five under state law. Plaintiff has since abandoned three of her state law claims; she maintains her claims for violations of the Alabama Constitution (Count IV) and for the tort of misrepresentation (Count VI). IV. DISCUSSION A. The State and its agencies are immune from suit. The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from entertaining suits brought against unconsenting states. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); see also Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66-67, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (<HOLDING>). The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against holding that a state university is not a person within the meaning of 1983 and therefore is not subject to suits brought under 1983holding that a state is not a person within the meaning of 1983holding that a police department is not a person within the meaning of section 1983holding state university is not a person under 1983holding that a state is not a person under 42 usc 1983 & \n\nto allege that a municipal custom or policy caused the plaintiffs injury\u2019 \u201d (quoting Dwares v. City of New York, 985 F.2d 94, 100 (2d Cir.1993))); Lozada v. City of New York, No. 12-CV-0038 (ILG)(JMA), 2013 WL 3934998, at *7 (E.D.N.Y. July 29, 2013) (dismissing Mo-nell claim as conclusory where plaintiff failed to \u201cprovide any facts that would allow the court to infer what city policies, practices, or customs contributed to or caused the deficiency\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). 2. Failure to Supervise Plaintiff also raises a failure-to-supervise claim against the City. As with h ants\u2019 CCRB and LAB disciplinary records in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion (see generally Discip. Records), and although she does not raise such an argument in d 319, 331 (2d Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>), with Seri v. Town of Newtown, 573 F.Supp.2d holding that excessive force claims are not subject to exhaustion requirementholding similar evidence sufficient to sustain a jury verdict of possession with intent to distribute cocaineholding five complaints of excessive force over twentytwomonth period sufficient to sustain jury verdictholding that inquiry as to whether officers are entitled to qualified immunity for use of excessive force is distinct from inquiry on the merits of the excessive force claimholding that exhaustion requirement applies to excessive force claims & \n\na defense to the claims asserted. It is a \"constitutional principle\u201d that \"limit[s] the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction under Article III,\u201d Seminole Tribe v. Fla., 517 U.S. 44, 64, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), therefore the Court considers Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on the basis of sovereign immunity as attacking subject matter jurisdiction. 9 . FMC v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 753-54, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (explaining that \"the Eleventh Amendment does not define the scope of the States' sovereign immunity; it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity .... the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d); see also Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890) (<HOLDING>). 10 . This suit primarily seeks declaratory holding that sovereign immunity barred a federal question suit against a state brought by one of its own citizens even though the text of the eleventh amendment only addresses suits brought by citizens of another stateholding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that the eleventh amendment protects a state from suit by its own citizensholding state immune from suit brought by its own citizensholding that utah did not waive its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to a suit brought in federal court because state statute provided for exclusive original jurisdiction in its own courts & \n\nfactor seven, the relative bargaining power of the parties, weighs against a finding that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily made the waiver. An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin. Servs. Co., 191 F.Supp.2d at 814 (<HOLDING>). Consequently, Bank of America failed to meet holding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntaryrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding under similar facts as a matter of law that a knowing and voluntary waiver of powells right to a jury trial has not been demonstratedholding waiver of right to counsel not voluntary and knowing when defendant terminated counsel and requested another attorney but the trial court would allow delay and appointment only upon waiver of speedy trial right & \n\nemployment. Consequently, Miller was required to comply with K.S.A. 12-105b(d)\u2019s notice requirements, which she failed to do, and the claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against Flores was dismissed. 916 F. Supp.1101. Garcia raises state law claims against the police department and the officers acting within the scope of their employment. We agree with the district court that Garcia\u2019s claims could give rise to a number of actions whereby the appellees could be hable in Kansas, namely assault, battery, false imprisonment, invasion of privacy, and damages for racial profiling. All of these types of claims are covered by K.S.A. 2010 Supp. 12-105b(d)\u2019s notice requirement. See Knorp v. Albert, 29 Kan. App. 2d 509, 513, 28 P.3d 1024, rev. denied 272 Kan. 1418 (2001) (<HOLDING>); King v. Pimentel, 20 Kan.

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that claims brought under the Whistle- blower Law are torts subject to the OTCA and that whistleblower remedies are not directly in conflict with the OTCA. Dr. Rabkin\u2019s jury award of $500,000 under the Whistleblower Law must accordingly be remitted to $200,000 as set forth in the OTCA. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court in the appeal brought by OHSU. We now turn to Dr. Rabkin\u2019s cross-appeal. VI. ,We review a district court\u2019s ruling regarding equitable reinstatement for an abuse of discretion. Gotthardt v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 191 F.3d 1148, 1156 (9th Cir.1999); see also Cancellier v. Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, 672 F.2d 1312, 1319 (9th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). \u201cThe district court abuses its discretion holding that reinstatement in an age discrimination case lies within the discretion of the trial court after careful consideration of the particular facts of the caseholding that whether dismissal or transfer is appropriate lies within the sound discretion of the district courtholding that the weight accorded to evidence lies largely within the discretion of the agencyholding that the decision whether to grant a continuance lies in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretionholding that the decision whether to grant reconsideration lies largely within the discretion of the trial court & \n\nSaulpaugh whole, its failure to apply a compound rate of interest to its calculation of damages constituted an abuse of discretion. See Clarke, 960 F.2d at 1153. On remand, however, the district court may wish to deny interest for specific years if it concludes that a delay in the litigation was the result of dilatory tactics by the plaintiff. We leave this determination to the district court in the first instance. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Saulpaugh the remedy of front pay. The award of front pay is discretionary, and where as here the district court makes a specific finding that an award of back pay was sufficient to make a plaintiff whole, no abuse of discretion can be found. Cf. Barbano v. Madison County, 922 F.2d 139, 147 (2d Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). V. Reasonable Attorneys\u2019 Fees Saulpaugh next holding that it is within the courts discretion to award both reinstatement and punitive damages for violation of 2114 although finding that the district courts decision not to award such remedies did not constitute an abuse of discretionholding that an award of compensation for future lost earnings or front pay is an equitable matter for the court not the juryholding that failure to award front pay because the district court impliedly found that other relief was sufficient did not constitute an abuse of discretionholding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny an award of attorneys fees to the wife & \n\nother equitable relief, costs, and attorneys fees (Doc. 115) is granted in part and denied in part as follows: plaintiff shall recover from defendant back pay in the amount of $8,063, with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $1,363; plaintiffs costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; compensatory damages as found by the jury in the amount of $1,000; pecuniary damages as found by the jury in the amount of $12,000; and punitive damages as found by the jury in the amount of $20,000. 1 . 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. 2 . See Whatley v. Skaggs Cos., 707 F.2d 1129, 1138 (10th Cir.1983) (\"title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) leaves to the discretion of the trial court the amount of back pay to be awarded a successful plaintiff in an employment discriminatio 61 F.Supp.2d 1219 (D.Kan.2001) (<HOLDING>). 11 .

Accordingly, we reverse the ICA\u2019s ruling that the trial court abused its discretion in giving the instruction. B. Ford\u2019s Supplemental Document Productions Ford also challenges the ICA\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s partial denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude Ford\u2019s supplemental production of documents. Preliminarily, plaintiffs styled their request as a \u201cmotion in limine,\u201d but based it on the rules of discovery. We thus construe the motion as a request for discovery sanctions, the denial of which we review under an abuse of discretion standard. See Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai'i at 241, 948 P.2d at 1082. See also Thibeault v. Square D Co., 960 F.2d 239, 244 (1st Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). In their motion, plaintiffs cited HRCP Rule holding that the intent to discriminate under batson is a pure issue of fact subject to review under a deferential standardholding that the standard of review for an award of statutory damages is even more deferential than an abuse of discretion standardholding that the less deferential skidmore standard was a more appropriate standard to be applied to an agencys unpublished opinionrecognizing that the interaction of general constitutional rules governing pretrial identification procedures and the deferential standard of habeas review affords significant discretion to the state courtrecognizing the rock solid basis for such a deferential standard of review & \n\npublic interest.\u201d Administrative agencies are far better suited than \u00e1re courts to make determinations based on the broad policy question of what is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Third, \u00a7 925(c) contains a restriction on the consideration of new evidence by the district courts, stating; \u201cThe court may in its discretion admit additional evidence where failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d This constraint on the admission of evidence suggests that the initial adjudication of applications is limited to the Secretary of the Treasury. We therefore conclude that Congress in tended for district court review to be contingent on an initial consideration of an application by the Secretary. See Saccacio v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 211 F.3d 102, 104 (4th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Owen v. Magaw, 122 F.3d 1350, 1354 (10th holding that persons seeking restoration of federal firearms privileges need not exhaust administrative remedies to invoke the judicial review provision of section 925cholding that congress clearly intended to suspend 925c relief by denial of funding for investigating and processing applications under the statute and denying writ of mandamusholding that section 925c authorizes judicial review of only the denial of an application for reliefholding that the only role for the judiciary is judicial review of a denial of relief under 925cholding that the standard of review is abuse of discretion and an appeal from denial of rule 60b relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review & \n\nsuppression motion for failure of the prosecution to go forward with an evidentiary showing. II. 18 We hold that the trial court erred in assigning the initial burden of going forward to the prosecution and reverse the suppression order. A. Standard of Review T9 We review a suppression order with deference to the trial court's findings of historical fact and will not overturn those findings if supported by competent evidence in the record. People v. Castaneda, 249 P.3d 1119, 1122 (Colo.2011). We review the trial court's legal determinations de novo. Id. B. Applicable Law $10 A motion to suppress under Crim. P. 4l(e) is a claim that defendant's Fourth Amendment rights have been violated. People v. Jansen, 713 P.2d 907, 911 (Colo.1986); People v. Jorlantin, 196 P.3d 258, 259 (Colo.2008) (<HOLDING>). The motion should state with reasonable holding that the driver of a borrowed car had the requisite legitimate expectation of privacy to support standing for fourth amendment purposesrecognizing that standing for a motion to suppress invokes the movants fourth amendment right to privacyholding that the fourth amendment protects property as well as privacyholding that squatter had no reasonable expectation of privacy and therefore no fourth amendment standing to challenge search of abandoned structurerecognizing an implied fourth amendment action for damages & \n\nand Fenner had not misrepresented his condition as he was merely asked his opinion about his physical abilities: \u201cDo you have any injuries, you know, that would prevent you from doing this type of work.\u201d Fenner answered in the negative. Whether this ruling was correct must remain unexamined. Trimac\u2019s appeal on this issue was deemed untimely by this Court, and consequently, we are constrained to review only Fenner\u2019s post-employment conduct. 11 . Some of the cases the majority offers to support its argument are inapplicable, as well, because they rely on a lower standard than that required in South Dakota. See, e.g., Appleby, 22 Ark.App. 243, 738 S.W.2d 807 (considering whether an employee's actions aggravating a pri- or injury were merely reasonable); Amoco Chemical Corp., 318 A.2d 614 (<HOLDING>); Johnnie\u2019s Produce Co., 120 So.2d 12 (noting a holding exclusion h does not apply where employees were merely negligentholding that it is well established that whether an employees actions were within the scope of employment is a question of fact and even if some of the actions were unauthorized the question of whether the actions were within the scope of employment is for the juryholding that written warnings that impacted the probability an employee would be terminated are adverse employment actionsholding an employees actions in disregarding his doctors warnings were negligentrecognizing as viable actions in tort negligent hiring and negligent retention & \n\nis \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that Superintendent Rounds is racist. Zamora points to: (1) comments al legedly made by Superintendent Rounds that New Mexico\u2019s Governor (an Hispanic woman) is inept; (2) Rounds\u2019 hiring a man who had authorized a social experiment at a New Mexico high school that gave the appearance of race discrimination; (3) the reassignment of Zamora\u2019s duties in 2007 and 2008 to Caucasians; and (4) comments made by two co-workers in conversations surreptitiously recorded by Zamora following his termination in which they opined that Superintendent Rounds had engaged in racially discriminatory practices. To establish pretext from such comments or actions, Zamora must tie them to his termination, which he has not done. See Johnson v. Weld Cnty., 594 F.3d 1202, 1218 (10th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>). Ill The judgment of the district court is holding 2254d authorizes federal court to review state courts decision only and not explanation of decisionholding that without any meaningful connection in either time or topic to the employment decision the alleged comments and actions cannot give rise to an inference that the defendants explanation for that decision is pretextualholding that an employer in an employment discrimination case may not justify its conduct based on evidence that did not motivate it at the time of the employment decisionholding that evidence contrary to an administrators decision does not make the decision arbitrary and capricious so long as a reasonable basis appears for the decisionholding that the relevant time is the time of the employment decision & \n\nwe hold that it is not subject to an assertion of equitable estop-pel. As its name implies, equitable es-toppel embraces the notion that a party should not be permitted to profit by asserting rights against another when that party\u2019s own inequitable conduct has lulled the other into action or inaction detrimental to its position. See Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health & Rehab. Servs. v. S.A.P., 835 So.2d 1091, 1096-97 (Fla.2002) (citing State ex rel. Watson v. Gray, 48 So.2d 84, 87-88 (Fla.1950)). The doctrine has been most commonly held to preclude a defendant from raising a statute of limitations defense when the defendant\u2019s false representations mislead the plaintiff into failing to file suit within the limitations period. See Major League Baseball v. Morsani, 790 So.2d 1071, 1076 (Fla.2001) (<HOLDING>); Rinker Materials Corp. v. Palmer First Nat'l holding that the timely filing of a discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission is a requirement like a statute of limitations that is subject to waiver estoppel and equitable tollingrecognizing cause of action for equitable estoppel under erisaholding that defendants may be estopped from raising defense of statute of limitations even though equitable estoppel is not listed in fla stat 95051holding that equitable estoppel may bar a partys assertion of a statute of limitationsholding an evidentiary hearing on the applicability of equitable estoppel & \n\nThe consensual overhear applications and orders for eavesdropping devices worn on the person are not included in the appellate record as required by Supreme Court Rule 608(a)(6). See 210 Ill. 2d R. 608(a)(6) (the record on appeal must contain, among other things, eavesdropping orders and other similar documents). 4 Following oral argument, this court granted Stroud\u2019s motion to cite additional authority regarding the proper standard of review for eavesdropping necessity. Stroud argued that there was a split in the federal circuit courts regarding the proper standard of review. Our research reveals that the majority of circuits, including the Seventh Circuit, use an abuse of discretion standard of review. See United States v. Ramirez-Encarnacion, 291 F.3d 1219, 1222 n.l (10th Cir. 2002) (<HOLDING>), citing United States v. Phillips, 959 F.2d holding that the admission of evidence under an exception to the hearsay rule is reviewed for abuse of discretionholding that the conclusion that the wiretap was necessary in each situation is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and bringing the tenth circuit into accordance with the authority of a majority of other circuitsholding that the imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretionholding under third circuit law that the denial of a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretionholding under third circuit law that denial of rule 11 sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion & \n\ntestified, but states that without the benefit of discovery cannot admit or deny the factual allegations contained therein.

Compare Hohri v. United States, 782 F.2d 227, 239-41 (D.C. Cir.1985), with id. at 944-946 (dissenting opinion) (divided views on \u201cplain meaning\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(2) (1982)). When administrative' action is in question, as in the instant case, the governing statute may fail to say with precision whether judicial review should initially occur in a district court, or directly in a court of appeals. The matter at hand pointedly illustrates these difficulties, as did our previous encounter with these appellants, Lorion v. NRC, 712 F.2d 1472 (D.C.Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>), rev\u2019d sub nom.

To address public policy for the first time at this stage in the litigation deprives the Munns of the opportunity to rebut Hotch-kiss\u2019s version of events. How, for example, could the Munns have known that they needed to offer evidence of \u201cthe normal expectations of the participants in the activity under review\u201d?

During the course of the EEOC\u2019s investigation, Milliren additionally alleged that she would be one of only two female LGMs out of 500 LGMs nationwide if she had completed the GMDP and that a female applicant was rejected for a manager position because she had children. Because the EEOC\u2019s investigation into Milliren\u2019s charge of individual gender discrimination revealed potential systemic gender discrimination, the EEOC had the authority to subpoena information relevant to systemic gender discrimination even absent a valid systemic charge by Milliren. See, e.g., EEOC v. Cambridge Tile Mfg. Co., 590 F.2d 205, 206 (6th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). III.

The civil forfeiture in Plaintiffs\u2019 case was achieved by a consent judgment in judicial proceedings; the civil forfeiture did not involve agency action. By its own terms, \u00a7 702 only applies where the party seeks judicial review of agency action. Because the instant forfeiture took place in the context of a civil judicial proceeding, there is no agency action for the district court or this Court to review. See Comm, of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of Columbia, 28 F.3d 130, 134 (D.C.Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). The APA therefore cannot be the basis for a holding that under the apa exhaustion is a prerequisite to judicial review when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review so long as the administrative action is made inoperative pending that reviewholding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordholding apa 5 usc 702 inapplicable because no agency proceeding took place for the court to reviewholding that the apa does not afford an implied grant of subjectmatter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency actionholding a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands & \n\nof the Court may be viewed as the position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\" Marks v.

The narrowest ground for the court's disposition in Williams is that of the lead opinion and Justice Thomas: the subject report was not testimonial. But, as the Arizona Supreme Court recently explained, the plurality's 'primary purpose' test nor Justice Thomas's solemnity standard can be deemed a subset of the other; therefore, there is no binding rule for determining when reports are testimonial.\" State v.

In light of the substantial evidence supporting the court\u2019s finding of causation, see infra, we cannot conclude that the district court's decision not to rule on the Rule 52(c) motion was an abuse of discretion. Riverboat also asserts that, in reviewing the district court\u2019s decision, we should evaluate the record at the close of the plaintiffs' case^\u2014 the time at which the motion was made\u2014 rather than the record as a whole. Riverboat's position is not supported by our case law nor by Rule 52(c). The defendants can point us to no rule of law that prohibits us, in reviewing the district court\u2019s Rule 52(c) order, from evaluating the record as a whole. See Duval v. Midwest Auto City, Inc., 578 F.2d 721, 723-24 (8th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>). 30 .

This Court has already determined that a unitary filing with the EEOC in which the complainant checked the box at the bottom of the standard EEOC charge form requesting that the charge be filed with both the EEOC and the state agency satisfies the requirement that plaintiffs commence proceedings under state law. See Capps, 67 F.Supp.2d 589. Other federal courts in Virginia have reached the same or similar conclusions. See Harris v. TJX Companies, Inc., 60 F.Supp.2d 562 (W.D.Va.1999) (<HOLDING>); Grimes v.

Individual Liability Wilson alleges claims of race discrimination pursuant to Title VII, the ELCRA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against Budco and Raymond. As Wilson conceded during a hearing on the motion, an individual who does not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d is not subject to individual liability under Title VII. Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe now hold that an individual employee\/supervisor, who does not otherwise qualify as an \u2018employer\u2019 may not be held personally liable under Title VIL\u201d).

An employer is directly liable for hostile environment sexual harassment if it knew, or upon reasonably diligent inquiry should have known, of the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. See Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.1989); Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11th Cir.1982). Under this theory of direct liability, the City can be held liable for its own negligence or recklessness, but not for the conduct of its supervisors or employees. In contrast, an employer is indirectly, or vicariously, liable for the wrongful conduct of its agent, whether or not the employer knew or should have known about the agent\u2019s 6-07 (4th Cir.1989), vacated in part, 900 F.2d 27 (4th Cir.1990)(<HOLDING>); Hicks v.

But these excuses do not make Monson\u2019s own conduct any less willful or malicious. The collapse of the business did not relieve Monson of the contractual obligations which he entered into or give him carte blanche to make off with equipment he bought with someone else\u2019s money. Demonstrably, Monson knew his actions were wrongful and without just cause. Further, Monson\u2019s behavior falls outside of the sort of reckless or unfortunate but non-malicious acts that this Court have previously held do not rise to the standard of a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

See Vega v. Hernandez, 381 F.Supp.2d 31, 38 (D.Puerto Rico 2005). A public employer who fails to make an adequate investigation of an employee\u2019s sexual harassment complaint can be held liable under Title VII for hostile work environment created by another of its employees under negligence theory, without regard to effectiveness of employer\u2019s remedial action. See O\u2019Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713 (1st Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico claims holding that physician was an independent contractor and thus could not sue hospital under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964holding there is no private right of action to enforce disparateimpact regulations brought under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 in part because of the enforcement scheme congress provided in that statuteholding that congress intended for idea to be interpreted consistent with fee provisions of statutes such as title vii of the civil rights act of 1964holding liability for claims under civil rights act of 1964 and remedial administrative procedures which emphasized going through channels providing no mechanism to female firefighter for airing grievances involving conduct of superiors who were in chain of commandholding that title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 provides the exclusive remedy for claims of employment discrimination by federal agencies & \n\nVII because the action of the Sheriff\u2019s Office interfered with his employment opportunities with third party employers. Because defendants moved for summary judgment only on the question of the employment relationship between plaintiff and defendants, it is not necessary for us to decide the viability of this theory. We note, however, that the Fifth Circuit apparently has not resolved the question of whether an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by Title VII, can be liable under Title VII for interference with a plaintiff's employment opportunities with a third party. See Diggs v. Harris Hospital-Methodist, Inc., 847 F.2d 270, 272 & n. 2 (5th Cir.1988); Daniels v. Allied Elec. Contractors Inc., 847 F.Supp. 514 (E.D.Tex.1994). See also Sibley Memorial Hosp. v.

The interplay of OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 34-9-11 (a) and 34-9-15 (b), which this Court has not previously addressed, is informed by how we and the Court of Appeals have interpreted the interplay between the exclusive remedy provision and subsection (a) of OCGA\u00a7 34-9-15. (b) It is well established that a settlement under OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15 (a) which requires an employer to compensate its employee for an alleged injury bars a subsequent tort suit by the employee against anyone protected by the exclusive remedy provision, regardless of the actual circumstances of the employee\u2019s injury and the amount of compensation to which the parties agreed. See Haygood v. Home Transp. Co., 244 Ga. 165, 166-167 (259 SE2d 429) (1979) (<HOLDING>); Thorn v. Phillips, 164 Ga.

Although all three statutes provide that a supervisor is an employer, a number of courts have held that Congress included the phrase \u201cany agent\u201d to make sure that respondeat superior liability was imposed on the employers for the acts committed by their agents, not upon the agents personally. Id. at 50-51. Accordingly, Plaintiffs ADA claims against the Individual Defendants are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. B. TITLE VII CLAIMS AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS The First Circuit has held that there is no individual employee liability under Title VII. Fantini v. Salem State College, 557 F.3d 22 (1st Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). \u201c \u2019The statutory scheme of Title VII itself holding that the definition of employer for title vii purposes does not encompass individu al supervisors even if such individuals are acting as agents of the employerholding that only employers not individuals acting in their individual capacity who do not otherwise meet the definition of employers can be held liable under title viiholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that title vii does not provide for a damages claim against supervisors or fellow employeesholding individual defendants are not an employer within meaning of title vii & \n\nas an \u201cagent\u201d of WMATA, is an \u201cemployer\u201d hable under section 2000e-2(a)(l) for discriminating against her on the basis of her sex. While a construction of the statute to impose individual liability on an agent is facially plausible, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of this agent provision was to incorporate respondeat superior liability into the statute.\u201d Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s Int'l Inc., 991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir.1993) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while a supervisory employee may be joined as a party defendant in a Title VII action, that employee must be viewed as being sued in his capacity as the agent of the employer, who is alone hable for a violation of Title VII. See Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). Considering the evidence in the hght most holding individual defendants are not an employer within meaning of title viiholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that there is no individual liability under title viiholding that individual employees are not liable under title viiholding individual employees may be liable under title vii & \n\nwhich he likens to the more familiar terms \u201cfor just cause\u201d or \u201cfor cause,\u201d which remove employment from the at-will category. The School District does not dispute that \u00a7 20.7(3) is applicable to Lockhart, but does contend that Lockhart is nonetheless an at-will employee. Quite surprisingly, no reported Iowa decision has directly addressed the issue of whether \u00a7 20.7(3) negates the presumption of at-will employment for the public employees and employers covered under this provision of the Iowa Public Employment Relations Act. The few cases that have specifically addressed \u00a7 20.7(3) deal with its interaction with other statutory provisions involving discharge of public teachers. See, e.g., Northeast Community Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Community Sch. Dist., 402 N.W.2d 765, 770 (Iowa 1987) (<HOLDING>); McFarland v. Board of Educ., 277 N.W.2d 901, holding that a collective bargaining agreement between school board and teachers union established a teachers legitimate claim of entitlement to their positions at elementary schoolholding that 2073 was not inconsistent with the provision regarding the discharge of a teacher employed by public schools iowa code 27927recognizing application of sovereign immunity to school districtsholding that 2073 expressly grants school districts the power to suspend teachers for proper cause for disciplinary reasons provided an iowa code 27927 discharge proceeding has been initiatedholding that the district was not liable under respondeat superior for a teachers sexual assault of a student even though it occurred on school grounds and during school hours because the criminal misconduct was not within the scope of the teachers employment & \n\n368, 376 (2008) (\u201cAn employer may be found directly liable for discrimination under G.

Indeed, addressing a different subsection of \u00a7 1396a(a), the Supreme Court has held that the Medicaid Act\u2019s \u201cadministrative scheme cannot be considered sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a congressional intent to withdraw the private remedy of \u00a7 1983.\u201d Wilder, 496 U.S. at 522, 110 S.Ct. 2510.

If the plaintiff were to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy, the local courts would be presented with an issue of first impression under Puerto Rico law. Until he travels that road, the availability vel non of the inverse condemnation remedy remains open to question. It is the claimant\u2019s burden to prove that the potential state remedy is unavailable, and uncertainty prevents him from carrying that burden. Consequently, his section 1983 takings claims are unripe. See Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 64-65 (<HOLDING>). The plaintiffs second argument focuses on the holding that plaintiff had failed to state a claim for relief under section 1983holding that due process is not violated when a state employee intentionally deprives an individual of property or liberty so long as the state provides a meaningful postdeprivation remedy such as an article 78 proceedingholding that as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority a court should not vacate his decisionholding as long as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to impeach the reliability of a scientific test and the qualifications of the person administering the test due process is not implicated by a states good faith failure to preserve a sample for independent testingholding that as long as the state provides an arguably adequate process for securing compensation for a taking federal intervention un der section 1983 before the claimant has resorted to that procedure is premature & \n\n1995, writ denied) (plaintiffs equitable remedy of reinstatement not precluded); and City of Midland v.

Plaintiff has since abandoned three of her state law claims; she maintains her claims for violations of the Alabama Constitution (Count IV) and for the tort of misrepresentation (Count VI). IV. DISCUSSION A. The State and its agencies are immune from suit. The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from entertaining suits brought against unconsenting states. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); see also Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66-67, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (<HOLDING>).

We find equally unfounded the argument that any agreements Jones may have had in his Superior Court cases \u201cdon\u2019t have anything to do with this case.\u201d Def.App., Tab E at 42. Defendant\u2019s whole point was that Jones may have planted the gun in this case in order to \u201cwork off\u2019 obligations that arose in those Superior Court cases. Hence, agreements in the other cases have everything to do with this case. Nor does it matter that agreements in other cases may have involved other prosecutors. The United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia prosecutes cases in both the federal District Court and the local Superior Court, and the prosecutor is responsible (at a minimum) for all Brady information in the possession of that office. See Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763 (<HOLDING>). For a similar reason, we reject as irrelevant holding that a promise to make a loan is not covered by 1823e because a promise is not an assetholding there was sufficient evidence for a jury to conclude that the defendant did not intend to perform when the promise was madeholding a duty to act is created by reliance not by the person to whom the aid is to be rendered but by another who as a result of the promise refrains from acting on that persons behalfholding that ignorance by one prosecutor of promise made by another is irrelevant since the prosecutors office is an entity and a promise made by one attorney must be attributed for these purposes to the governmentrecognizing that a unilateral contract can be formed when only one promise is illusory because the nonillusory promise can serve as an offer which the promisor who made the illusory promise can accept by performance & \n\nEstate of Stephenson, 243 Neb. 890, 503 N.W.2d 540 (1993). In reviewing a question of law, an appellate court reaches a conclusion independent of the lower court\u2019s ruling. In re Estate of Stull, supra, citing Goff-Hamel v. Obstetricians & Gyns., P.C., 256 Neb. 19, 588 N.W.2d 798 (1999). ANALYSIS On appeal, Muff and Lauridsen argue that the county court erred in awarding Thomsen fees because there is no such office as an attorney for an estate and, secondly, because at all times Thomsen was proceeding contrary to Tucker\u2019s expressed desires and wishes. Ordinarily, the right of an attorney to compensation for his or her services depends upon a contract of employment, express or implied. In re Estate of Stull, supra. See, also, Doyle v. Union Ins. Co., 209 Neb. 385, 308 N.W.2d 322 (1981) (<HOLDING>). In Doyle v. Union Ins.

In Flores, the court issued a protective order preventing defendant\u2019s discovery of the plaintiffs immigration documents, social security numbers, and passports in a suit seeking unpaid wages under the FLSA. 233 F.Supp.2d at 462, 465. The court concluded that the information was irrele vant and its minimal probative value outweighed by its potential for prejudice. Id. at 464-65. See also Zeng Liu, 207 F.Supp.2d at 193 (denying defendant\u2019s request to discover information relating to plaintiffs immigration status because such information is both irrelevant and the need for its disclosure outweighed by the risk of injury to the plaintiffs, even if the parties were to enter into a confidentiality agreement); Cabrera, 695 N.W.2d at 81 (<HOLDING>).

Joint, however, maintains that it considered Mr. Weaver to be an independent agent for tax purposes only. In May 2011, Mr. Weaver terminated the Agreement. Joint filed the First Lawsuit two months later. Mr. Weaver moved for summary on Joint\u2019s contract claims. He asserted the Agreement was illegal (and therefore unenforceable under Oklahoma law) because Joint paid him as an independent contractor to induce patient referrals for the furnishing of Medicare\/Medicaid-covered equipment, in violation the Medicare Anti-Kickback Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). See United States v. McClatchey, 217 F.3d 823, 835 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Joint countered that the Agreement was legal holding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victimholding that a threat to harm another person is a crime of violenceholding that a person who offers or pays remuneration to another person violates the act so long as one purpose of the offer or payment is to induce medicare or medicaid patient referralsholding that attorneys claim for professional services against person sui juris or against property of such person must rest upon contract of employment express or implied made with person sought to be charged or with his agentholding that a state was embraced within the meaning of the word person where the word person was defined as meaning and including a partnership association company or corporation as well as a natural person & \n\nis an essential element of a strongly-endorsed and well-articulated policy to eliminate drunk driving by affording offenders \u201czero tolerance\u201d in the prosecution of their offenses. This Court has a commitment to eliminating intoxicated drivers from our highways and has supported that commitment with a ban on plea bargaining in drunk-driving cases. The aims of this broad policy can be accomplished only through consistent, uniform, and vigorous enforcement of the ban. To carve out from that ban an exception in cases of \u201cpermitting an intoxicated person to drive\u201d undermines the important policy behind the prohibition. The person who allows an intoxicated person to drive may be as, or even more, culpable than the driver. See, e.g., Lee v. Kiku Restaurant, 127 N.J. 170, 603 A.2d 503 (1992) (<HOLDING>); Kelly v. Gwinnell, 96 N.J. 538, 476 A.2d 1219 holding that tavern will be held liable for serving alcohol to visibly intoxicated patron who then foreseeably becomes involved in a motor vehicle accidentholding that the sensible and popular understanding of what a motor vehicle accident entails necessarily involves the motor vehicle being operated as a motor vehicle holding proprietor of a tavern was not liable to officer who sustained injuries caused by a patron while the officer was attempting to make an arrestholding tavern owner not liable for injuries sustained when intoxicated patron assaulted a police officerholding a social host liable for serving a visibly intoxicated guest who foreseeably becomes involved in motor vehicle accident & \n\nof a plan...\u201d); \u00a7 1121(b) (\u201c...only the debtor may file a plan until after 120 days after the date of the order for relief\u2019). I find persuasive an additional reason why \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d should be construed to describe eligible transfers rather than to impose a temporal restriction on the transaction itself. As a description, \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d embodies an intent to exclude ordinary course of business and non-debtor transactions from the scope of \u00a7 1146(c). These meanings lie within the definition of \u201cunder\u201d and are necessary to apply the provision. If Congress intended to encourage plan confirmation, it follows that Congress would facilitate the process by providing tax relief for only those transfers necessary for the plan, rather th 124-25 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1995) (<HOLDING>); cf., The Baldwin League of Independent holding that debtors cannot claim an exemption in a homestead after trustee avoided the transfer of the property as a fraudulent conveyance because the transfer by the debtors was voluntaryholding that new yorks notice to judgment debtors satisfied due process by specifying that a procedure existed to adjudicate exemption claims and advising debtors to contact an attorney even though the notice did not inform judgment debtors of the specific steps to be taken to test exemption claimsholding it was irrelevant that irss collection of 100 section 6672 liability against responsible nondebtor debtors principal officer and major shareholder would affect the debtors reorganization although nondebtors financing was necessary for debtors reorganization bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction to enjoin the irs at debtors request on behalf of nondebtorholding that transfers between nondebtor third parties not subject to 1146c exemption even if transfer necessary to finance acquisition of debtors propertyholding that grant or denial of debtors claim of property exemption is final appealable order & \n\n"}

Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). Cronic was a companion case-to Strickland; however, in Cronic the question before the Supreme Court was whether counsel\u2019s representation was such that, even without a showing of prejudice, it might be presumed to have occurred. See id at 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Under the analysis developed in Cronic, such would be the case when counsel was absent during a critical stage of the trial. See id. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039. Case law has developed to instruct us that a determination of whether the absence of counsel has occurred at a critical stage is dependent upon whether the evidence presented during counsel\u2019s absence was directly inculpa-tory of the defendant. See U.S. v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 772 (5th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>).

At the core of Marble's argument is the notion that the presumption of adequate assistance is rebutted by a mere showing that defense counsel's acts or omissions amounted to plain error. We disagree. An inquiry into whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective is a separate and distinet inquiry from plain error review, especially where the defendant has conceded that trial counsel invited the alleged errors. See State v. Dumn, 850 P.2d 1201, 1220 (Utah 1998) (<HOLDING>); State v.

Anticipating our conclusion that estoppel requires a showing of prejudice, the Athridges maintain that prejudice should be presumed in this case. This argument stands on firmer ground: An insured may be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, depending on the amount of control the insurer exercised over the defense. See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 384 F.2d 316, 318 (D.C.Cir.1967); Diamond, 476 A.2d at 657-58. Assuming the Athridges were entitled to this presumption, summary judgment was still proper because Aetna rebutted the presumption with uncontroverted evidence that its participation did not harm Iglesias.

The Virgin Islands Supreme Court relied on two theories in concluding that Kendall\u2019s opinion was a clear and present danger to the fairness of the Ford case. Neither passes muster. According to the Virgin Islands Supreme Court, Kendall\u2019s opinion was punishable because it \u201ccalled the very integrity of [its mandamus] decision into question\u201d by \u201cblatantly accusing], without proof, the Justices ... of gross dereliction of their sworn duties and of committing illegal acts.\u201d Yet Kendall\u2019s criticism of the decision to issue mandamus \u2014 even if it unfairly impugned the Justices\u2019 motives \u2014 is simply not enough.

The presumed prejudice exception to Strickland has been found to apply where there was an actual or constructive denial of counsel, the state interfered with counsel\u2019s assistance, or counsel had an actual conflict of interest.

The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has emphasized that such instances are rare. See Nixon, 543 U.S. at 190, 125 S.Ct. 551 (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, this Court has stressed that holding that a showing of actual prejudice was required where the defendant claimed that counsel was ineffective for conceding guilt at the guilt phase of a capital trialholding that counsels failure to investigate the defendants personal and psychiatric history constituted ineffective assistance during the penalty phase but not during the guilt phaseholding that prejudice was not shown where there was overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that trial courts witness interrogation did not cause defendant prejudice when there was already overwhelming evidence showing defendants guiltholding defendant waived right to challenge incourt identification when he admitted guilt at punishment phase of trial & \n\nineffective assistance under Strickland [v.

Ficco, 438 F.3d 35, 49 (1st Cir.2006). In this case, it is clear that the error complained of \u2014 Goldman\u2019s sentencing as a Career Offender despite the invalidity of one of his essential prior convictions \u2014 had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d The government does not dispute that Goldman\u2019s Career Offender status increased his sentence by at least seventeen years. This constitutes a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d and meets the Strickland standard. See Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. 198, 203, 121 S.Ct. 696, 148 L.Ed.2d 604 (2001) (<HOLDING>).

In his view, the Supreme Court would not have vacated the state judgment of conviction if it had not been satisfied that Faretta knowingly exercised his right to self-representation; thus, the Court\u2019s discussion of what constitutes a \"knowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of the right to counsel \u201cwas essential to its conclusion that Faretta\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\u201d Infra at 566. We are not convinced. Given Faretta's recognition of a constitutional right to represent oneself, the Court might well have vacated the state conviction and remanded the case even without a finding of a valid waiver of the right t 1984) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

Like other aspects of personal autonomy, it is too easily smothered by government officials eager to tell us what\u2019s best for us. The recent tendency of judges to insinuate tort causes of action into relationships traditionally governed by contract is just such overreaching. It must be viewed with no less suspicion because the government officials in question happen to wear robes. Ill Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning. The California Supreme Court is once again leading the way. Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 765 P.2d 373, 254 Cal.Rptr. 211 (1988), has taken a bite out of Seaman\u2019s by holding that tort remedies are 805, 195 Cal.Rptr. 421 (1983) (<HOLDING>). At long last, however, we seem to be moving holding that plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim was predicated on tort and that it was therefore subject to the statute of limitations for tort actionsholding the government liable to plaintiffs for breach of contractholding that there must be a tort distinguishable from or independent of the breach of contract in order for a party to bring a valid claim in tort based on a breach in a contractual relationshiprecognizing that there can be compelling circumstances in which a trial court can determine that neither party prevailed in a contract caseholding that a party can be liable in tort for actions authorized by the contract & \n\nSecurities Act of 1933. Dissent at 1433. The Supreme Court's decision in Blue Chip, however, takes precisely the opposite approach: it interprets the differing language of the two Acts as evidence of the Acts\u2019 differing ambits. See Blue Chip Stamps, 421 U.S. at 733-734, 95 S.Ct. at 1924-1925 (noting that Congress' use of the term \"in offer or sale\u201d in the 1933 Act showed that \"when Congress wished to provide a remedy to those who neither purchase nor sell securities, it had little trouble in doing so expressly\u201d). To ignore the linguistic differences between the definitions in the two Acts is to suggest implicitly that Congress did not know what it was doing when it chose the differing language. This we refuse to do. 6 . See Blue Chip Stamps, 421 U.S. at 733 n. 5, 95 S.Ct. at 1924 n. 5 (<HOLDING>) (emphasis in original). 7 . The dissenting holding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase sale or issuance of the instrumentholding that the wording of 10b making fraud in connection with purchase or sale of security a violation of the act is surely badly strained when construed to provide a cause of action not to purchasers or sellers of securities but to the world at largeholding that section 10b violation occurs on date of alleged misrepresentation not the date of the sale or purchase of securitiesholding that for a section 10b violation the sec must prove that the defendant in connection with the purchase or sale of securities made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact with scienter and that the plaintiffs reliance on the defendants action caused injury to the plaintiffholding only purchasers and sellers of securities can recover under section 10b and rule 10b5 & \n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel); Boag v. Raines, 769 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir.1985) (same).

However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v.

This evidence \u2014 the prolonged retention of the Agreement that Husband promised to destroy as soon as Wife signed it, coupled with the subsequent attempt to enforce it \u2014 though slight, is sufficient to establish the existence of fraud, especially here, in light of the relationship between the parties and the nature of the Agreement.

Blake argues that because Farrington commissioned the Harrigan map, that map constituted a representation by Farrington. However, commissioning another to create a map is not in itself a representation for equitable estoppel purposes. Rather, a commissioned map or document constitutes a representation in equitable estoppel where a party uses the document to induce another party to act. See, e.g., Slagle v. United States, 809 F.

Given this, and given Major Bux-ton\u2019s strong privacy interests in her personnel files, it is clear that even under the more exacting standard of \u00a7 552(b)(6), disclosure of the requested documents would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy. Thus, the requested documents are properly exempt from disclosure under FOIA. III. Because the requested documents are exempt from disclosure under either \u00a7 552(b)(6) or \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C), and consequently, also under the Privacy Act, plaintiffs motion for summary judgment must be denied and the Air Force\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be granted.

Even the cases the Committee cites indicate that the privilege covers agency deliberations about decisions, as well as the formulation of policy positions. In Taxation with Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677 (D.C.Cir.1981), the Court stated, \"the privilege protects documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated ....\u201d See also Paisley v.

U.S. Capitol Police Bd., 218 holding that where an authorized disclosure is voluntarily made to a nonfederal party whether or not that disclosure is denominated confidential the government waives any claim that the information is exempt from disclosure under the deliberative process privilegeholding that in analyzing whether materials are protected from disclosure under exemption 5 of foia which protects materials covered by the deliberative process privilege a court must first be able to pinpoint an agency decision or policy to which these documents contributed and stating that the decision whether to prosecute an individual is the type of decision protected by the privilegeholding that emails among prosecutors relating to decision not to prosecute were covered by the deliberative process privilegeholding that the information is not protected by attorneyclient privilegeholding that internal emails about how to present an agency decision to the public were covered by the deliberative process privilege & \n\nCourt is skeptical that section 6 is properly read as broadly as the government urges. But because the matters alleged by the plaintiffs are, as we will discuss, subject to the state secrets privilege, we need not definitively determine the thorny issue of the proper scope of section 6. b. Section 102A(i)(l) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 Section 102A(i)(l) states that \u201c[t]he Director of National Intelligence shall pro tect intelligence sources and methods from disclosure.\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403-1(0(1). Plaintiffs concede this statute allows the Director of National Intelligence to withhold information covered by the statute when it is requested of him or agencies under his control. See, e.g., CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 1881, 85 L.Ed.2d 173 (1985) (<HOLDING>); Fitzgibbon v.

See Bank of New England, 986 F.2d at 602 n. 4.; see also Federal Reserve, 499 F.2d at 64 (emphasizing the federal nature of question being litigated). Defendant asserts that, even if the RTC\/ FDIC itself could have brought suit in federal court, SN-1 is a private assignee of the RTC\u2019s rights and interests, and does not inherit its federal instrumentality status. The Seventh Circuit, struggling with the interplay between FIRREA and the TIA, concluded that the TIA precluded federal jurisdiction over claims brought not by the RTC or a successor of the federal agency, but by a private party assignee of the federal government. See RTC Commercial Assets Trust v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 169 F.3d 448, 452 (7th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); see also North Georgia Elec.

See State v. Larsen, 865 P.2d 1355, 1363 (Utah 1993). Hines's testimony was relevant in \"help{ing] the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\" see Utah R. Evid. 702(a), by explaining what concerns may drive an investor's decision to purchase a security. Compare Larsen, 865 P.2d at 1861 (determining that an expert's opinion testimony \"that some of the material that [the defendant] had omitted from the securities documents could have been important or significant to an investor\" was admissible), with State v. Tenney, 913 P.2d 750, 756 (Utah Ct.App.1996) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse holding that such information is not material under securities lawholding that omission of information about shares held in corporations was material even if the securities were worthless at the timeholding that under certain conditions a bank assumes a duty to disclose facts material to a transactionholding that purely factual material may be withheld from disclosure under exemption 5 if that material would expose the deliberative process of an agencyholding inadmissible expert testimony that included statements that failure to disclose certain enumerated information would be a material omission under utah law that the material actually provided to investors did not meet disclosure requirements under the act and that the agreements at issue were securities under utah law & \n\n\u2014 a variety of their people to get all the documents for \u2014 reference the fish pond together. And it took some time. I mean, he\u2019s not \u2014 he\u2019s not the only reporter that we end up having to do work for. Although MacPherson testified that the reason for the delay was that assembly of the eleven pages \u201ctook some time,\u201d she could not remember when she first asked that the documents be assembled or when she received the assembled documents. In the 108 days it took to fill the request, she only remembers making three phone calls to two people in an effort to get the request filled. \u00b6 31 Although a request for voluminous documents that are not all located in the same place might justify some delay in responding to a document request, cf. Cleaver v. Kelley, 415 F.Supp. 174, 175-76 (D.D.C.1976) (<HOLDING>), similar delays have been upheld only with holding agencies of state government are part of the state for purposes of sovereign immunityholding that foia exemptions are not mandatory bars to disclosure because the purpose of foia is to provide broad disclosure of government documentsholding that the duty of disclosure affects not only the prosecutor but the government as a whole including its investigative agenciesholding that state and local government agencies were not persons under the fcaholding that the failure of two government agencies to process a disclosure request within the time provisions of the foia was not in effect a denial of the request because those agencies were faced with an unpredictable backlog of requests that were being processed in chronological order & \n\nof 1988 Act No. 305, \u00a7 1. The 1988 version provided an exemption for \u201ccash surrender value of life insurance in the aggregate amount of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\u201d In 1993, the General Assembly enacted the current version of S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 38-63-40 as part of 1992 Act No. 89, \u00a7 1, which removed the fifty thousand dollar limitation on the cash surrender value exemption and added several key provisions to the statute. Specifically, the General Assembly provided that proceeds and cash surrender values were protected \u201cwhether or not the right to change the beneficiary is reserved\u201d and \u201cwhether or not the policy is payable to the insured if the beneficiary dies first\u201d and added an exception in cases where \u201cthe insured has filed a petition in bankruptcy within two years of 002) (<HOLDING>); In re Henderson, 167 B.R. 67, 73 holding that the debtorinsured was entitled to exempt the cash surrender value of her life insurance policy naming her dependent son as a beneficiary under illinois statute providing exemption for all proceeds payable because of the death of the insured and the aggregate cash value of any or all life insurance policies payable to a wife or husband of the insured or to a child parent or other person dependent upon the insuredholding as unambiguous under iowa law the insurance policys exclusion of coverage to any obligation of the insured to indemnify another because of damages arising out of a bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insuredholding that a debtor in bankruptcy may claim as exempt the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy insuring the life of the debtor that is payable to a beneficiary other than the debtor under dccode ann 314716a2001 despite the absence of the term cash surrender from the statuteholding that the tennessee statute providing an exemption for a life insurance policy made for the benefit of the insureds spouse andor children or dependent relatives allows for the exemption of the cash surrender values of such policiesholding that where the debtor is the owner of a policy insuring his own life and listing his wife as the beneficiary upon his death the proceeds of the policy including the cash value thereof are exempt from the claims of the insureds creditors & \n\nwho are part of the public.\u201d Summary judgment was therefore appropriately granted to the Town. Given that conclusion, there is no need to address VSC\u2019s argument that the court erred in evaluating a different portion of the \u201cpublic use\u201d test set forth in American Museum of Fly Fishing. Affirmed. 1 It is true, as the dissent posits, that the meaning of the term \u201cpublic use\u201d has been fleshed out through our case law, and there is little statutory language to be construed. Nonetheless, the Court is bound to construe tax exemptions strictly against the taxpayer lest all taxpayers be burdened with the costs of conferring a benefit to select individuals rather than to the public at large. See, e.g., Delta Psi Fraternity v. City of Burlington, 2008 VT 129, \u00b6 14, 185 Vt. 129, 969 A.2d 54 (<HOLDING>). 2 We are not persuaded, as the dissent is, holding one who claims tax exemption has burden of showing entitlement to exemptionholding a debtors claim for loss of consortium to be entitled to an exemption under the oklahoma exemption statute and collecting other bankruptcy decisions recognizing a debtor spouses loss of consortium as the basis for allowing an exemption under federal and various state exemption statutesholding that when interpreting tax exemption statutes we strictly construe the statute in favor of taxation and against exemptionrecognizing that the right to hold land without being subject to taxation may constitute a substantial detriment to the affected locality and a significant advantage to the landowner and that land use ought not to result in exemption from taxation absent the conferral of a substantial public benefit such as the tax exemption law was designed to foster quotation omittedholding act qualifies as exemption statute under exemption 3 & \n\nthat the acquisition of a new claim of homestead defeats and discharges a previously-filed claim of homestead. The court agreed with Citizens, holding that the plain language of \u00a7 2 meant that Garran\u2019s \u00a7 1A declaration and corresponding homestead exemption was defeated and discharged by his wife\u2019s subsequent \u00a7 1 declaration. We agree that this is the proper reading of the statutory language. Garran\u2019s wife filed a declaration of homestead under \u00a7 1 on February 21, 2001. The declaration of homestead under \u00a7 1 is an acquisition of a homestead \u201cfor the benefit of [the] family.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1. Therefore, by his wife\u2019s filing of a \u00a7 1 declaration, Garran, as her spouse and member of her family, \u201cacquired\u201d a homestead on February 21, 2001. See In re Roberts, 280 B.R. 540, 547 (Bankr.D.Mass. 2001) (<HOLDING>). Section 2 states that \u201cthe acquisition of a recognizing that the eighth amendment protects individuals from a lingering deathholding debtor could include property because the bank accepted payments directly from the debtor and had previously allowed the debtor to cure defaultholding that the fourth amendment protects people not placesrecognizing that a declaration filed under subsection 1 protects even the nonfiling debtorrecognizing that no private right of action exists for subsection a violations & \n\nheld that the scope of any waiver by virtue of disclosure was to be defined by the so-called \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d, which'\u201caim[s] to prevent prejudice to a party and distortion of the judicial process that may be caused by the privilege-holder\u2019s selective disclosure during litigation of otherwise privileged information.\u201d Id. at 101. Thus, the extent of any waiver by implication turns on the circumstances of the disclosure. Since the disclosure in von Bu-low had occurred in an \u201cextrajudicial\u201d setting\u2014by publication of a book\u2014the court there held that the unfairness to which the waiver doctrine was addressed was not implicated. As a result, the publication waived the privilege only with respect to the particular communications or portions of communications actually disclosed.

Plaintiff suggests that all documents prepared prior to this date were created in the ordinary course of business, not in anticipation of litigation, and the burden rests on Defendant to show otherwise. Based on this record, Defendant has not provided this Court with sufficient information to determine which documents dated prior to May 28, 2002 that were identified in its Privilege Log are protected by the work product doctrine. Defendant failed to provide this Court with evidentiary proof of objective facts, via affidavits or deposition testimony, that documents before May 28, 2002, the date coverage was expressly denied, were prepared in anticipation of litigation. See, e.g., Totaltape, 135 F.R.D. at 201 (<HOLDING>). The Court will, therefore, find that no holding declaration or affidavit must support work product claim for documents listed solely as work product on privilege logholding that not all of claims file was prepared in anticipation of litigation and noting that the majority of cases that have dealt with the issue of whether investigative materials prepared by insurance claims adjusters is workproduct prepared in anticipation of litigation have held that since insurance companies have a routine duty to investigate accidents such materials are not prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that the work product doctrine applied to a document prepared in anticipation of litigation and was therefore protected from disclosure under foia exemption 5holding that a party failed in meeting its burden that documents were work product because the party resisting discovery failed to present affidavits or other evidentiary support for its contention that the documents were prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that the moving party need not support its motion with affidavits or other evidence if the nonmovant will bear the burden of proof at trial & \n\nonly improves on the questions of fact. \u00b617 The employer also argues that neither Mayor Johnson nor the article revealed that Mr. White had epilepsy; only that he had seizures for which he had regularly been taking medicine to control. This could be a distinction without a difference, or at least it presents a genuine issue of material fact. In other words, a jury could find that the mayor\u2019s statement and the article that reported it undoubtedly referred to epilepsy. \u00b618 The employer argues that the information disclosed was not highly offensive. Cases from other jurisdictions involving publication of the intimate details of an employee\u2019s medical health have met the \u201chighly offensive\u201d requirement. See Blackwell v. Harris Chem. N. Am., Inc., 11 F. Supp. 2d 1302, 1310 (D. Kan. 1998) (<HOLDING>); Wagner v. City of Holyoke, 241 F.

Balancing of Harm and Public Interest Similarly, it is doubtful that the balancing of harm and public interest warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that even minimal interference with the First Amendment freedom of the press causes an irreparable injury. See, e.g., Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); see also Barbnicki v.

V. Beazer challenges on two grounds the court\u2019s entry of judgment against it and in favor of Agrico on Agrico\u2019s equitable indemnification claim. First, Beazer contends that under controlling .South Carolina law, equitable indemnification lies only between parties having a contractual or special relationship that did not exist between Beazer and Agri-eo. Second, Beazer contends that equitable indemnity does not lie in favor of a party that itself is at fault in causing the injury for which indemnification is sought and that here Agrico was so at fault. We disagree on both points and find no error in this part of the court\u2019s judgment. Judgment was entered only for litigation costs incurred by Agrico in defending against Dent\u2019s 22, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1982) (<HOLDING>).

In addition, to give proper meaning to a specific contract provision, a court must consider it in the context of the entire contract. Hand, 983 So.2d at 687.

Reformation of the 2007 Mortgage is reserved to the parties to that mortgage and\/or the state court. For these reasons, approval of the Compromise in the form offered is not possible.

Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000) (internal quotations omitted). A motion to dismiss may only be granted where the allegations fail to state any claim upon which relief can be granted. See Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.1997). Dismissal is warranted \u201cif it is certain that no relief can be granted under any set of facts which could be proved.\u201d Klein v. General Nutrition Cos., Inc., 186 F.3d s Brennan and its progeny too broadly. Specifically, Hartford asserts that where a dispute centers on whether a particular policy provision is contrary to a constitutional, legislative or administrative mandate, the controversy may be subject to judicial review. See, e.g., Warner v. Continental\/CNA Ins. Cos., 455 Pa.Super. 295, 688 A.2d 177, 181 (1996) (<HOLDING>). In view of this exception, Hartford maintains holding that where a contract containing an arbitration clause is challenged as unconscionable those disputes should first be resolved by an arbitratorrecognizing general rulerecognizing exception to general rule that disputes arising under contract with valid arbitration clause are referred to arbitratorholding that an arbitrator not a federal or state court will resolve questions concerning validity in the first instance when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contractholding defenses concerning the contract as a whole must be referred to ah arbitrator while defenses to the arbitration provision itself are considered by the court & \n\nv. American Oil Co., 257 Ind. 458, 276 N.E.2d 144, 148 (1971) (\u201cWe do not mean to say or infer that parties may not make contracts ... providing for indemnification, but it must be done knowingly and willingly as in insurance contracts made for that very purpose.\u201d). To ensure that a party is not saddled with an unintended burden to insure or indemnify, such provisions are \u201cstrictly construed ... and will not be held to provide indemnity unless so expressed in clear and unequivocal terms.\u201d Moore Heating, 583 N.E.2d at 145 (\u201cCourts disfavor such indemnification clauses because to obligate one party to pay for the negligence of the other party is a harsh burden which a party would not lightly accept.\u201d); see also Exide Corp. v.

Steele by Steele, 452 N.E.2d 167, holding that an indemnification clause that covers all claims demands rights and causes of action of any kind whether arising from avants own acts or those of fitness pointe encompassed indemnification for negligent implementation of a fitness programholding that because the indemnification clause contained no clear statement that would give the contractors notice of the harsh burden that complete indemnification imposes indemnification was inappropriateholding that where the policy includes indemnification coverage to the corporation proceeds are not property of the estate where there is no proof of payments by corporation of paymentsholding that although a letter agreementwas clear and unambiguous in requiring indemnification for undisclosed liabilities the relevant paragraph was uncertain and indefinite in that it did not specify what warranties representations and indemnification were appropriate holding directors and officers liability policy was property of the estate because the estate was worth more with indemnification coverage than without the coverage & \n\naward, do not justify overturning that award. Instead, only \u201cutterly irrational\u201d legal conclusions will be cognizable; \u201c[i]n these circumstances the appropriate standard of review is whether the construction of the contract presents such an egregious mistake that it amounts to an arbitrary remaking of the contract between the parties.\u201d 277 Cal.Rptr. at 714. Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v.

App. 3d 91, 98 (1977). Moreover, if the promisee bargains with the promisor to render a performance directly to a third party, in nearly every case the promisee will have intended to benefit that third party. Fox Lake, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 911. Here, Advanced clearly stands to benefit from the contract between McCormick and Berbee. Thus, this court must determine from the language of the contract and the circumstances surrounding the parties whether the benefit to Advanced is direct or incidental. Although the intent of the parties must be determined on a case-by-case basis, the cases cited by the parties to this appeal provide examples on both sides of this issue. Courts have held that the benefit was direct in the following cases: (1) Carson Pirie Scott, 346 Ill. at 261 (<HOLDING>); (2) Resnik, 78 Ill. 2d at 386-87 (determining holding prior to gonzaga that medicaid provision requiring nursing facilities to provide certain services was intended for the benefit of the recipients and not for the benefit of the facilitiesholding that the parties purchase agreement did not require a showing of prejudice for plaintiff to assert that defendant waived its claim for indemnificationholding that where purchaser had taken possession and paid part of the purchase price the statute of frauds did not bar enforcement of a purchase agreementholding that a creditors pmsi in goods sold to debtors did not survive consolidation of the original installment contract with a later contract for the purchase of additional goodsholding that an agreement to purchase certain goods from a named vendor and pay for them if the hotel company did not was for the direct benefit of the vendor & \n\nbetween Long Creek, Little River, Limehouse, and Lake Wylie, the Court can attest that the factual premise of Rickborn\u2019s argument is an understatement. Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 25, 2014) (stating the rule applies \u201c \u2018if doubt exists as to the extent or fact of coverage\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buddin v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967)) (emphasis added)). As this Court has explained, exclusion A.7 is not ambiguous on the issue of whether a pickup is a private passenger auto. Cf. Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\nlong as a \u2018person has obtained a benefit from another by fraud, duress, or the taking of undue advantage.\u2019 \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting Newington Ltd. v.

Mims, 405 S.W.3d 319, 339 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2013, no pet.).

See, eg., I.M.A., Inc. v. Rocky Mountain Airways, Inc., 713 P.2d 882, 888 (Colo.1987) (stating that the parties' agreement on essential terms of a contract as required to establish a contract can be inferred from their conduct or oral statements); Smith v. Multi-Financial See. Corp., 171 P.3d 1267, 1272 (Colo.App.2008) (stating that nonsignatories may nonetheless be bound by agreements to arbitrate based on common law contract principles). This reading also abandons the long-standing common law rule that a settlement agreement can be governed by and found enforceable under common law contract principles. See H.W. Houston Constr. Co. v. Dist. Court, 632 P.2d 568, 565 (Colo.1981) (<HOLDING>); Goltl v.

Those decisions \u2014 which do not involve mortgage assumptions \u2014 are inapplicable here because Mrs. Brush\u2019s assumption of her father\u2019s mortgage was not a modification of Wells Fargo\u2019s prior agreements with him. As Wells Fargo notes, a transf\u00e9ree\u2019s agreement to assume a loan is a new promise and does not necessarily extinguish the transferor\u2019s personal obligation under the loan. See Restatement (Third) of Property (Mortgage) \u00a7 5.1(b)(2) (\u201cWhen mortgaged real estate is transferred with assumption of liability ... the transferor remains personally liable for the covenants in the mortgage and for the obligation secured by the mortgage, to the extent such liability existed prior to the transfer.\u201d); Shockey v.

Joint, however, maintains that it considered Mr. Weaver to be an independent agent for tax purposes only. In May 2011, Mr. Weaver terminated the Agreement. Joint filed the First Lawsuit two months later. Mr. Weaver moved for summary on Joint\u2019s contract claims. He asserted the Agreement was illegal (and therefore unenforceable under Oklahoma law) because Joint paid him as an independent contractor to induce patient referrals for the furnishing of Medicare\/Medicaid-covered equipment, in violation the Medicare Anti-Kickback Act (the Act), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b)(2)(A). See United States v. McClatchey, 217 F.3d 823, 835 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Joint countered that the Agreement was legal holding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victimholding that a threat to harm another person is a crime of violenceholding that a person who offers or pays remuneration to another person violates the act so long as one purpose of the offer or payment is to induce medicare or medicaid patient referralsholding that attorneys claim for professional services against person sui juris or against property of such person must rest upon contract of employment express or implied made with person sought to be charged or with his agentholding that a state was embraced within the meaning of the word person where the word person was defined as meaning and including a partnership association company or corporation as well as a natural person & \n\nwitness list (contrary to his assertion at trial that the presiding officer \u201cdidn\u2019t say anything\u201d) this was not an arraignment. Rather, this was a preliminary and informal meet ing to establish what would be required for the SCM trial proceeding. We find this to be no different than a military judge requiring counsel to submit a docketing request that includes anticipated pleas and forum, and proposed trial dates. See Army Reg. 27-10, Legal Services, Military Justice, para. 5-21 (16 Nov. 2005). As indicated by the lack of a recorder and the informality of the meeting, the purpose of the initial meeting was not to formally call upon appellant to enter pleas, but to properly prepare the presiding officer for what he would need in order to conduct the SCM.

[\u00b6 8] \u201cComity is a principle under which the courts of one state give effect to the laws of another state ... not as a rule of law, but rather out of deference or respect.\u201d Trillium USA, Inc. v.

Sydlik\u2019s interpretation is unimportant when we may construe the contract without that interpretation. Certainly, had she stated she did not believe she had released anyone from liability, appellees would not put such stock in her view. Holding to our traditional rules of interpretation for pre-injury releases, we turn now to determine what claims and parties were released within the four corners of the contract. b. Claims Released As we have explained already, to satisfy the express negligence prong, the release must mention all claims it purports to release. Sydlik relies on certain cases to argue that the language in the release is not specific enough. See Ethyl Corp. v. Daniel Constr. Co., 725 S.W.2d 705, 708 (Tex.1987) (<HOLDING>); Victoria Bank & Trust Co., 811 S.W.2d at holding that subcontractor was not obligated to indemnify general contractor for general contractors own negligence where indemnification clause did not expressly state that subcontractor would indemnify general contractor for such negligenceholding that if the party seeking indemnity is held liable in part because of its own negligence common law indemnification is unavailable and the only remedy is contributionholding that illinois construction contract indemnification for negligence act invalidates indemnity provision in contract between general contractor and postal serviceholding that indemnification provision did not expressly state the party was seeking indemnity for its own negligence so as to satisfy express negligence testholding that indemnification without regard to the negligence of any party clearly and unequivocally provided bay drilling with indemnification for its own negligence & \n\nEstate of Stephenson, 243 Neb. 890, 503 N.W.2d 540 (1993). In reviewing a question of law, an appellate court reaches a conclusion independent of the lower court\u2019s ruling. In re Estate of Stull, supra, citing Goff-Hamel v. Obstetricians & Gyns., P.C., 256 Neb. 19, 588 N.W.2d 798 (1999). ANALYSIS On appeal, Muff and Lauridsen argue that the county court erred in awarding Thomsen fees because there is no such office as an attorney for an estate and, secondly, because at all times Thomsen was proceeding contrary to Tucker\u2019s expressed desires and wishes. Ordinarily, the right of an attorney to compensation for his or her services depends upon a contract of employment, express or implied. In re Estate of Stull, supra. See, also, Doyle v. Union Ins.

The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy.

The defendants\u2019 reliance on a string of cases holding that municipal attorneys in positions similar to Selkirk\u2019s were not protected by Elrod and Branti, is irrelevant and misplaced. The very essence of the following cases required an examination of the duties of each plaintiff to ascertain whether his position entailed \u201cpolicymak-ing\u201d responsibility or required political fealty to effectively perform. The Court need not undertake such an analysis here because the Defendants have already done so and concluded to the contrary. See Livas v. Petka, 711 F.2d 798 (7th Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); Mummau v.

And Muller, which did address a challenge comparable to the present case, implicitly rejects rather than supports intervenors\u2019 ripeness argument, deciding on the merits a claim that the existence of an unexercised legislative veto provision in a statute rendered actions taken under that statute unconstitutional.

In support of its conclusion that the alleged constitutional deprivation was the death of Mrs. Macias, the district court cited the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and City of Canton v.

Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 260, 107 S.Ct. 1114, 94 L.Ed.2d 293 (1987), and this court\u2019s opinion in Harris v. City of Roseburg, 664 F.2d 1121, (9th Cir.1981). In each of those cases, the Supreme Court and this court treated the deprivation of a constitutional right as the alleged \u201cinjury.\u201d See Monell, 436 U.S. at 692, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (<HOLDING>); Harris, 489 U.S. at 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197 holding that 1983 plainly imposes liability on a government that under color of some official policy causes an employee to violate anothers constitutional rightsholding that although municipalities are persons within the meaning of 42 usc 1983 no municipal liability lies under that statute unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tortholding that discrimination against a municipal employee could trigger municipal liability under 1983 through official policy or customholding private actors are not acting under the color of state law for the purposes of section 1983 liabilityholding that a defendant can only be sued in his official capacity under 1983 if he acted pursuant to an official policy or custom in causing the constitutional injury & \n\non some unspecified, but earlier date. See id. The Court notes that Plaintiffs do not cite to authority for their proposition that a defendant must \u201cexercise ... ordinary diligence\u201d in determining that a case is removable. See id. Nor has the Court been able to find support for Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that section 1446 requires defendants to exercise ordinary diligence in ferreting out grounds for removal. Rather, a defendant must remove within thirty days from the date on which he \u201creceives actual notice that the case has become removable, which may be communicated in a formal or informal manner.\u201d 14A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 3732, at 520 (emphasis added). See also Bosky v. Kroger Tex., LP, 288 F.3d 208 (5th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The Court therefore finds that the only holding that the one year limit applies only to removals based on something other than the initial pleading that is only to removals pursuant to the second paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding that a writ of summons alone can no longer be the initial pleading that triggers the 30day period for removal under the first paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding other paper must be unequivocally clear and certain to start the time limit running for a notice of removal under the second paragraph of section 1446bholding that the information supporting removal in a copy of an amended pleading must be unequivocally clear and certain to start the time limit running for a notice of removal internal quotation omittedholding that removal under the second paragraph of 1446b did not apply and defendants therefore had removed outside of the thirty day time period triggered at the time of service of the complaint & \n\nthe circuit court determines that amending his petition would do substantial justice.

Proc. \u00a7 8-301 to, inter alia, comply with the pleading requirement contained in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9)). In determining whether allowing Respondent to amend his petition would do substantial justice, the circuit court must articulate its reasoning on the record. If the circuit court concludes that Respondent may amend his petition to comply with the pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9), Respondent\u2019s averment must allege which convictions he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of, meaning which offenses he alleges he \u201cdid not commit.\u201d See Smallwood, 451 Md. at 320, 152 A.3d at 793 (<HOLDING>); see also Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9). holding that only defendants who can allege they are actually innocent meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they are convicted may bring a petition for relief under crim proc 8301holding that neglect was not excusable where the defendants did not do all that they were required to do after they received the summons and complaint in that they did not contact a lawyer or make any other arrangements with respect to their defenseholding that officers were entitled to qualified immunity because they did not know the residence for which they obtained a warrant actually contained multiple unitsholding in the context of a motion for preliminary injunction that once federal funds are distributed to the states and obligated they cannot be recouped and that it would be impossible to award the plaintiffs the relief they request if they should eventually prevail on the meritsholding that claims are related if they involve a common core of facts or they are based on related legal theories & \n\nProtective Proceedings, and Durable Power of Attorney Act of 1986) which provides a system of limited and general guard-ianships for incapacitated individuals and protective proceedings concerned with management of their estates.

However, the court held that leave of court was not required to amend the complaint because no responsive pleading had been filed. See Wilson v. Wilson, 785 A.2d 647, 649 (D.C.2001) (<HOLDING>). No issue concerning any subsequently filed holding that the defendant waived its impropervenue defense where its responsive pleading which asserted the defenses of failure to state facts to state a claim and failure to join a necessary party did not assert the defense of improper venueholding that a motion to dismiss was not a responsive pleading under rule 15holding that for purposes of super ct civ r 41b demand is not jurisdictional but an element of the shareholders claimholding that courts look to substance of plea for relief to determine nature of pleading not merely title of pleadingholding that a motion to dismiss is not a responsive pleading for purposes of super ct civ r 15a which permits a party to amend once as a matter of course before a responsive pleading is served & \n\n\u00a7 185.] For example, Senator Williams, a sponsor of ERISA, emphasized that the civil enforcement section would enable participants and beneficiaries to bring suit to recover benefits denied contrary to the terms of the plan and that when they did so \u201c[i]t is intended that such actions will be regarded as arising under the laws of the United States, in a similar fashion to those brought under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act.\u201d Id. In accord with the guidance set forth in Metropolitan Life, courts have found that the complete preemption doctrine\u2014 i.e. preemption under \u00a7 502(a) \u2014 permits removal of state law causes of action in a multitude of different ERISA-related circumstances.

For Plaintiff\u2019s claim to be within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the referenced protest must first be filed in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514. As Plaintiff\u2019s protest was untimely, Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent request for accelerated disposition could not revive it. The Court therefore holds that the protest dated February 6, 1995, was untimely and improperly filed. Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent acts failed to cure or amend its original protest. Because Plaintiff failed to file a valid protest, Customs\u2019 decisions are final and this Court lacks jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). New Zealand Lamb Co. v.

Like an award made pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent power, an award under \u00a7 1927 is proper when the attorney\u2019s actions are so plainly without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose. See, e.g., Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d 1265, 1273 (2d Cir.1986) (police photographs of client taken an hour after incident in which police officers allegedly employed excessive force in taking client into custody did not constitute such clear evidence of absence of excessive force to render client\u2019s attorney liable for his adversary\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a result of bad faith); Acevedo v.

On July 31, 2008, Starr Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand, arguing that Defendants' removal to federal court was premature as a matter of law because Starr Plaintiffs had yet to file a complaint in the state court. Following a hearing on these motions, the Court granted Starr Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to remand, relying upon the Third Circuit's decision in Sikirica v. Nationwide Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 214, 223 (3d Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the case returned to holding that the one year limit applies only to removals based on something other than the initial pleading that is only to removals pursuant to the second paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding that a writ of summons alone can no longer be the initial pleading that triggers the 30day period for removal under the first paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding other paper must be unequivocally clear and certain to start the time limit running for a notice of removal under the second paragraph of section 1446bholding that removal under the second paragraph of 1446b did not apply and defendants therefore had removed outside of the thirty day time period triggered at the time of service of the complaintholding that an initial pleading triggered the thirtyday time limit for removal under 1446b because it sets forth on its face express allegations as to the monetary amount of damages & \n\nfunds that is required for the imposition of the statutory trust. Cucinotti next contends that the trial court erred in holding him personally liable. He points out that Reliance rested its theory of personal liability on several grounds, each of which was essentially abandoned in favor of the participation theory as articulated by the Supreme Court in its decision in Saltiel v. GSI Consultants, Inc., 170 N.J. 297, 788 A.2d 268 (2002), a decision released while the Reliance summary judgment motion was pending. While there are other reported decisions that hold that corporate officers who participate in fraud or conversion can be held personally liable for the losses occasioned thereby, see, e.g., Charles Bloom & Co. v. Echo Jewelers, 279 N.J.Super. 372, 382, 652 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.l995)(<HOLDING>); Robsac Indus., Inc. v. Chartpak, 204 holding defendants personally liable for alleged conversion even when acting in corporate capacityholding that a state officer sued in his individual capacity may be held personally liable for damages under 42 usc 1983 based upon actions taken in his official capacityholding that a corporate officer signing a contract in his corporate capacity is generally not liable for damages under the contractholding that the plaintiffs were entitled to discovery to determine whether the defendant intended to be bound in his personal andor corporate capacity where the agreement contained certain personal guarantees by the defendant but where the defendant signed the agreement only in a corporate capacity with no signature blocks provided for signing in a personally capacityholding that state officials may be personally liable for actions taken in their official capacity & \n\nand its agents. The pressure exerted against Naifeh to falsify records was no less intimidating because it was asserted by a fellow employee.

Other jurisdictions take varied approaches to claims of individual liability for wrongful termination. At one end of the spectrum, California, Illinois, and Kansas do not recognize liability for wrongful-discharge claims against individual non-employers. See Reno v.

After a responsive pleading has been filed, subsequent amendments are permissible only with leave of court, which \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). This liberal policy of allowing amendments under Rule 15(a) \u201ccircumscribes the exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion; thus, unless a substantial reason exists to deny leave to amend, the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.\u201d Shipner, 868 F.2d at 407; see also Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added). In this case, the district holding that denial of a postconviction motion without prejudice and with leave to amend is not a final appealable orderholding that denial of leave to amend is error in the absence of justifying reasonsholding that denial of motion for summary judgment is interlocutory even though trial judge had stated that there was no just reason for delay because denial of motion for summary judgment was not a final determination of defendants rights and the appeal did not affect defendants substantial rightsholding that a justifying reason must be apparent for denial of a motion to amendholding that though the court did not expressly state its reason for denying leave to amend it was apparent what delay and prejudice would be caused by plaintiffs motion which sought to add four new individual defendants as well as additional counts under two federal statutes and a statelaw claim & \n\n84 S.Ct. 710, 725-26, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964). Moreover, she did not have to reach the question whether the media defendants\u2019 actions were protected by a common law privilege for reporting official actions in the District. See Phillips, 424 A.2d at 88. 17 . The balance of the instruction explains what is meant by \u201cpublication of a statement\" and by a \"defamatory statement.\u201d 18 . It is important to emphasize that we are taking no position on the question whether, in this context, expert testimony would be required if a party raised the point. We note, however, that there is nothing to prevent a person who acted in or observed the transactions or occurrences at issue from testifying as an expert on the applicable standard of care. See Adkins v. Morton, 494 A.2d 652, 656-57 (D.C.1985) (<HOLDING>). 19 .

Now, what happens in a case where we proceed against the tobacco companies? Are we collaterally estopped from asserting a synergy argument against the tobacco companies because a jury has formerly held that the plaintiffs injury was not caused by asbestos? And despite that, can the tobacco companies nonetheless proceed and enter a defense and argue to a jury that in fact it's asbestos that caused the injury and not. tobacco? 9 . In Forbes v.

Both GRI 2(a) and GRI 3(b) employ the term \"essential character,\u201d but in rather different contexts.

See Midpeninsula Citizens for Fair Housing v. Westwood Investors, 221 Cal. App. 3d 1377, 1386, 271 Cal.Rptr. 99 (1990) (<HOLDING>); see also Bowden v. Redwood Inst.

Accord ingly, Ms. Prescott\u2019s claim on behalf of Kyler survives under the ACA . it Standing RCHSD argues that Ms. Prescott lacks standing to assert a section 1557 claim on her own behalf because she is not an aggrieved party. However, as Ms. Prescott has noted, she is not bringing the claim on her behalf, but instead on behalf of Kyler. While Ms. Prescott is unable to bring a claim as an individual, she certainly can bring the claim on behalf of Kyler within her representative capacity. See Lopez v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 5 F.Supp.3d 1106, 1114-1115 (N.D. Cal. 2013) (<HOLDING>). Hi.

The district court nonetheless app . FEC, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 876, 175 L.Ed.2d 753 (2010). In our view, Nix\u2019s allegation that he intended to run in the November 2011 election and his public announcement at the press conference sufficiently establish the \u201csubstantial probability\u201d of imminent injury required for Article III standing.

Because a decedent\u2019s survival claim becomes part of her estate at death, it follows that the estate retains a justicia-ble interest in the survival action. We therefore hold that, in a survival action, the decedent\u2019s estate has a justiciable interest in the controversy sufficient to confer standing. See Landers, 369 S.W.2d at 35 (noting that a survival action seeks recovery for \u201cdamages sustained by the decedent and his estate as a result of the [wrongful] injuries.\u201d) (emphasis added); see also Glickstein v. Sun Bank Miami, N.A., 922 F.2d 666, 670 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>) (footnote omitted).

Texas, 176 U.S. 1, 19, 20 S.Ct. 251, 44 L.Ed. 347 (1900). Here, the Navajo Nation has no standing to assert the rights of the grandparents, nor do the grandparents have any rights under state or federal law. a. Navajo Nation Lacks Standing When acting solely in a representative capacity, a tribe\u2019s standing is based exclusively upon the standing of its individual members: the tribe simply raises claims that its members could raise individually, and essentially stands in the same position as they would had they brought the action collectively. The governmental entity must raise claims which affect all its members, not just a select few. See Alabama and Coushatta Tribes of Texas v. Trustees of the Big Sandy Indep. School Dist., 817 F.Supp. 1319, 1328 (E.D.Tex.1993) (<HOLDING>).

Miami Bus. L. Rev. 215, 220 (2000) [hereinafter \u201cDilorenzo Article\u201d] (stating the rationale behind not allowing Regulation B as an affirmative defense). As a result, while these courts recognize a plaintiff can offensively assert an ECOA violation as a civil action to recover damages against a creditor, they refuse to recognize an ECOA violation asserted as an affirmative defense. 2. Position #2: A debtor can assert an ECOA violation as an affirmative defense in the nature of recoupment. Many federal and state jurisdictions have allowed a plaintiff to assert an ECOA violation as an affirmative defense, even after the two-year statute of limitations has run for an offensive ECOA claim, by way of recoupment. See, e.g., Bolduc v. Beal Bank, SSB, 167 F.3d 667, 672 (1st Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); Silverman v. Eastrich Multiple Investor Fund, holding the recoupment doctrine could allow a spouse to assert an ecoa affirmative defense against a creditor even after the statute of limitations had runholding even though an affirmative action for damages is barred the debtor may assert an ecoa violation defensively in the nature of recoupmentholding defendant was entitled to assert an ecoa violation as an affirmative defense to avoid only her liability because to do otherwise would be to enforce conduct that is forbidden by the ecoaholding a plaintiff cannot assert a violation of the ecoa as an affirmative defenseholding that ecoa violation cannot be asserted as affirmative defense & \n\nCo., 55 Ill. App. 3d 91, 98 (1977). Moreover, if the promisee bargains with the promisor to render a performance directly to a third party, in nearly every case the promisee will have intended to benefit that third party. Fox Lake, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 911. Here, Advanced clearly stands to benefit from the contract between McCormick and Berbee. Thus, this court must determine from the language of the contract and the circumstances surrounding the parties whether the benefit to Advanced is direct or incidental. Although the intent of the parties must be determined on a case-by-case basis, the cases cited by the parties to this appeal provide examples on both sides of this issue. Courts have held that the benefit was direct in the following cases: (1) Carson Pirie Scott, 346 Ill. at 261 (<HOLDING>); (2) Resnik, 78 Ill. 2d at 386-87 (determining holding prior to gonzaga that medicaid provision requiring nursing facilities to provide certain services was intended for the benefit of the recipients and not for the benefit of the facilitiesholding that the parties purchase agreement did not require a showing of prejudice for plaintiff to assert that defendant waived its claim for indemnificationholding that where purchaser had taken possession and paid part of the purchase price the statute of frauds did not bar enforcement of a purchase agreementholding that a creditors pmsi in goods sold to debtors did not survive consolidation of the original installment contract with a later contract for the purchase of additional goodsholding that an agreement to purchase certain goods from a named vendor and pay for them if the hotel company did not was for the direct benefit of the vendor & \n\nat 1428-29. It has been held that a disclosure sufficient to waive the work product protection does not have to be intentional; therefore inadvertent or unintentional disclosures of protected materials also might result in the waiver of the privilege. See, e.g., Carter v. Gibbs, 909 F.2d 1450, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1990). However, such a disclosure does not automatically forfeit the attorney work product privilege. In determining whether a party has waived the privilege- through an inadvertent or involuntary disclosure, courts consider, among other factors,- the steps taken by a party to remedy the disclosure and any delay in doing so. See, e.g., United States v. Keystone Sanitation Co., 885 F.Supp. 672, 676 (M.D.Pa.1994); cf. United States v. de la Jara, 973 F.2d 746, 749-50 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). But see Carter, 909 F.2d at 1451 (holding recognizing privilegeholding that a defendant waived his attorneyclient privilege with regards to a seized letter because he waited six months after the seizure to assert his privilegeholding that failure to timely assert attorneyclient privilege constitutes waiverholding that governmental entities may assert attorneyclient privilege to prevent disclosure of information otherwise required by statuteholding that the information is not protected by attorneyclient privilege & \n\nof justice extends to sentencing under section 3C1.1.

As the district court pointed out, Lewis was a crucial witness regarding drug quantity (which is the primary consideration in de ment is inapplicable because he did not send the threat directly to Lewis, but rather included it in a letter to Holmes \u2014 suffers the same fate.

The court finds these alleged statements insufficient because they are unaccompanied by facts which demonstrate their accuracy or Defendants\u2019 involvement or control in their preparation. Moreover, as recently determined by one court in this district: \u201ca plaintiff cannot meet the requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) merely by pleading the specific time, place, and contents of misleading statements by a specifically identified analyst. Rather, to hold a defendant liable for misleading statements published by a third party, the plaintiff must at least identify the defendant who provided the information that the third party made public to the market.\u201d Barrie, 2002 WL 1841631, * 3; see also Suna v. Bailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 72-73 (1st Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>).

Pfenning v. Lineman, 947 N.E.2d 392, 398 (Ind.2011). Similarly, a plaintiff must establish that a duty of care exists to prevail on a claim of constructive fraud. Rice v. Strunk, 670 N.E.2d 1280, 1284 (Ind.1996). \u201cAbsent a duty, there can be no breach, and therefore, no recovery for the plaintiff in negligence.\u201d Pfenning, 947 N.E.2d at 398 (citation omitted). Old National asks that the Court adopt a \u201cno customer, no duty\u201d rule, which recognizes that a bank should not owe a duty of care to an \u201cundefined and unlimited category of strangers who might interact with [the bank\u2019s] customer.\u201d Eisenberg v.

Although the incentive to vigorously defend might be artificially created by the operation of collateral estoppel principles, augmenting a party's incentive to litigate in the first instance would undermine the very purpose behind permitting t ication of workers' compensation benefits. See\" Messina, 874 P.2d at 1066 n. 13 (<HOLDING>). Temporary total disability benefits are holding that legislature clearly intended that workers compensation act and unemployment security act be construed together thus prohibiting worker from receiving both unemployment compensation and workers compensation payments for same periodholding collateral estoppel elements met considering changed circumstances in the context of an exception to the general rule of collateral estoppelrecognizing the doctrine of collateral estoppel in agency proceedingsrecognizing that rationale underlying inapplicability of collateral estoppel to unemployment hearings is useful when analyzing same doctrine in workers compensation casesholding that pursuant to statute unemployment benefits must be offset against workers compensation payments & \n\nthat district court\u2019s claim-by-claim description of the frivolous nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint demonstrated clearly that their \u201cwidespread charges of racial discrimination [were leveled] without any regard for the truth ... in order to harass and embarrass the personnel at Fort Bragg\u201d). The third and fourth instances of bad faith were predicated on the district court\u2019s belief that both David and Samuel Sprafldn had offered testimony that \u201csimply was not credible.\u201d We have no doubt that when a party has materially perjured himself, this, standing alone, is sufficient grounds for finding bad faith.

Abbott Laboratories, 265 Ill.App.3d 991, 203 Ill.De\\c. 105, 639 N.E.2d 144, 147 (1993). Because Cook did not name any particular third party with whom he had a reasonable expectation of a business relationship, or toward whom Winfrey directed her interfering actions, the court concluded that the complaint was inadequate. Cook responds to this dismissal by identifying Illinois cases holding that the plaintiff may point to an identifiable \u201cclass\u201d of third parties with whom he had a business expectancy (and toward whom the defendant directed her interfering actions), rather than a single third party. See, e.g., River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park, 281 Ill.App.3d 154, 217 Ill.Dec. 410, 667 N.E.2d 499, 507 (1996) (<HOLDING>); Parkway Bank & Trust Co. v.

In Lalor, we concluded that a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence was not supported by probable cause. See 996 F.2d at 1583. In so doing, however, we distinguished Lalor\u2019s case from prior ones, including Suarez and Williams, wherein the nexus between criminal activity and the targeted premises was based on evidence of the suspect\u2019s drug traf ficking activities combined with the reasonable inference that drug-related evidence would be found in the suspect\u2019s home.

Guardsmark argues that nothing in the rule explicitly prohibits off-duty solicitation and that employees would not reasonably so construe it, especially after the company clarified the rule\u2019s safe harbor. We disagree. To begin with, because Guardsmark failed to communicate the safe harbor clarification to all employees who had received the handbook, the Board properly focused on the rule\u2019s language.

S. 188, 196-201 (93 SCt 375, 34 LE2d 401) (1972) (discussing the due process protection against the admission of evidence deriving from suggestive identification procedures). And it is firmly established that the determination of a witness\u2019s credibility, including eyewitness identification, is within the exclusive province of the jury. See Reeves v. State, 288 Ga. 545, 546 (705 SE2d 159) (2011). See also Walker v. State, 295 Ga. 688, 690 (763 SE2d 704) (2014) (<HOLDING>); Vega v.

Seiverling, 229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000) (internal quotations omitted). A motion to dismiss may only be granted where the allegations fail to state any claim upon which relief can be granted. See Morse v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 132 F.3d 902, 906 (3d Cir.1997). Dismissal is warranted \u201cif it is certain that no relief can be granted under any set of facts which could be proved.\u201d Klein v. General Nutrition Cos., Inc., 186 F.3d s Brennan and its progeny too broadly. Specifically, Hartford asserts that where a dispute centers on whether a particular policy provision is contrary to a constitutional, legislative or administrative mandate, the controversy may be subject to judicial review. See, e.g., Warner v. Continental\/CNA Ins. Cos., 455 Pa.Super. 295, 688 A.2d 177, 181 (1996) (<HOLDING>). In view of this exception, Hartford maintains holding that where a contract containing an arbitration clause is challenged as unconscionable those disputes should first be resolved by an arbitratorrecognizing general rulerecognizing exception to general rule that disputes arising under contract with valid arbitration clause are referred to arbitratorholding that an arbitrator not a federal or state court will resolve questions concerning validity in the first instance when parties agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under their contractholding defenses concerning the contract as a whole must be referred to ah arbitrator while defenses to the arbitration provision itself are considered by the court & \n\n\u201c(I)ssue preclusion requires that the party against whom issue preclusion is asserted in the present action was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.\u201d TLT Const. v. A. Anthony Tappe & Assoc., 48 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 5 (1999). M. and J. filed the application for criminal process against Benoit in the Leominster District Court on February 14, 1997, and thus were plainly parties in the district court adjudication. To establish S. was in privity with M. and J., there \u201chas to be a \u2018sufficient legal identity\u2019 between the interest of the person allegedly represented and the prior litigant for the later claim to be precluded.\u201d Mongeau v. Boutelle, 10 Mass.App.Ct. 246, 250 (1980) (citation omitted). See Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-Operative Bank, 7 Mass.App.Ct. 153, 158 (1979) (<HOLDING>). A \u201cnonparty to a prior adjudication can be holding that the current party was sufficiently identified with the parties to the prior litigationholding that prevailing party was entitled to attorneys fees under an option contract which had expired prior to litigation because the parties were litigating their performance under the terms of the contractholding that the party prevailing on the significant issues in the litigation is the party that should be considered the prevailing party for attorneys feesholding that a judgment as to the title in a prior litigation was not subject to collateral attackholding res judicata did not bar current litigation when prior litigation between the parties involved one breach of obligation under a joint venture agreement and instant litigation was based upon a different cause of action from a subsequent interference with the same agreement & \n\nmay be required to assist a handicapped child to benefit from special education.... \u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1401(17). In light of these definitions, defendants\u2019 attempt to characterize the program at Jewel Manor as \u201ctreatment,\u201d rather than \u201ceducation,\u201d must fail. The concept of education under the Act clearly embodies both academic instruction and a broad range of associated services traditionally grouped under the general rubric of \u201ctreatment.\u201d Any attempt to distinguish academics from treatment when defining \u201ceducational placement\u201d runs counter to the clear language of the Act. There can be no question that plaintiffs\u2019 assignment to Jewel Manor was an educational placement within the meaning of the Act. See, e.g., Kruelle v. New Castle County School District, 642 F.2d 687, 693 (3rd Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>). See also, Tokarcik v. Forest Hills School holding that when a term is not defined in a contract the presumption is that the term is to be given its ordinary meaning and significanceholding that loss of earnings was sufficiently encompassed by general prayer for reliefholding that the uniform commercial code specifically encompassed a software licensing agreementholding that a residential placement is encompassed within the term special educationholding that subcontractor can recover in quasicontract from contractor for work not encompassed in the agreement between the two & \n\nof Mr. Boggess, Detective Burke did nothing more than identify the person depicted in the photographs, the car shown in the photographs, and the place where the photographs were taken. Further, Mr. Boggess testified that the photographs showed him partially undressing after being baptized. We simply cannot find any prejudicial impact from the manner in which the photographs were introduced, nor the substantive content of what the photographs depicted. Consequently, the erroneous admission of the photographs has been shown to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. IV. CONCLUSION In view of the foregoing, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Mr. Flippo\u2019s motion for a new trial. Affirmed. 1 . See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 479, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1630, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (<HOLDING>). 2 . The medication and clothing were recognizing that any witness has the right to refuse to be interviewed if he so desires and is not under or subject to legal processholding that if a suspect indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioningholding that prior to engaging in custodial interrogation police must warn a suspect that he has a right to remain silent that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney either retained or appointedholding that police may continue questioning a suspect until he unambiguously invokes his right to remain silentholding that a suspect must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law that he has the right to the presence of an attorney and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires & \n\ndefense, which the defendant can waive\u201d; adopting this view, the court held that \u201cthe statute of limitations is a matter of defense that must be asserted at trial by the defendant\u201d); United States v. Spector, 55 F.3d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305 (1st Cir. 1992), and holding that the statute of limitations is not a jurisdictional bar but a waivable affirmative defense, and that the failu er in this area. See Benes v. United States, 276 F.2d 99 (6th Cir. 1960) (construing the criminal statute of limitations as a jurisdictional bar to prosecution, and holding that the statute was not tolled by an agreement between the parties that the government would not seek an indictment during the pendency of a related c 765 N.E.2d 894, 899 (2001) (<HOLDING>); Tennessee v. Pearson, 858 S.W.2d 879 (Tenn. holding a statute of limitations defense does not deprive court of subject matter jurisdiction to the extent the statute of limitations may be considered in any sense a jurisdictional impediment it is one which can be waivedholding that the aedpa statute of limitations is not jurisdictionalholding statute of limitations is not jurisdictional and can be waived by a voluntary plea of guiltyholding statute of limitations is jurisdictional and may be raised at any time but noting other ohio appellate courts have held the statute of limitations is not jurisdictional and may be waived if not asserted at the trial levelholding that the statute of limitations defense does not deprive court of subject matter jurisdiction to the extent the statute of limitations may be considered in any sense a jurisdictional impediment it is one which can be waived & \n\nis an essential element of a strongly-endorsed and well-articulated policy to eliminate drunk driving by affording offenders \u201czero tolerance\u201d in the prosecution of their offenses. This Court has a commitment to eliminating intoxicated drivers from our highways and has supported that commitment with a ban on plea bargaining in drunk-driving cases. The aims of this broad policy can be accomplished only through consistent, uniform, and vigorous enforcement of the ban. To carve out from that ban an exception in cases of \u201cpermitting an intoxicated person to drive\u201d undermines the important policy behind the prohibition. The person who allows an intoxicated person to drive may be as, or even more, culpable than the driver. See, e.g., Lee v. Kiku Restaurant, 127 N.J. 170, 603 A.2d 503 (1992) (<HOLDING>); Kelly v. Gwinnell, 96 N.J. 538, 476 A.2d 1219 holding that tavern will be held liable for serving alcohol to visibly intoxicated patron who then foreseeably becomes involved in a motor vehicle accidentholding that the sensible and popular understanding of what a motor vehicle accident entails necessarily involves the motor vehicle being operated as a motor vehicle holding proprietor of a tavern was not liable to officer who sustained injuries caused by a patron while the officer was attempting to make an arrestholding tavern owner not liable for injuries sustained when intoxicated patron assaulted a police officerholding a social host liable for serving a visibly intoxicated guest who foreseeably becomes involved in motor vehicle accident & \n\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint is abuse of discretion. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 330, 91 S.Ct. 795, 802, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971); Shipner v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 868 F.2d 401, 407 (11th Cir.1989). After a responsive pleading has been filed, subsequent amendments are permissible only with leave of court, which \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). This liberal policy of allowing amendments under Rule 15(a) \u201ccircumscribes the exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion; thus, unless a substantial reason exists to deny leave to amend, the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.\u201d Shipner, 868 F.2d at 407; see also Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added). In this case, the district holding that denial of a postconviction motion without prejudice and with leave to amend is not a final appealable orderholding that denial of leave to amend is error in the absence of justifying reasonsholding that denial of motion for summary judgment is interlocutory even though trial judge had stated that there was no just reason for delay because denial of motion for summary judgment was not a final determination of defendants rights and the appeal did not affect defendants substantial rightsholding that a justifying reason must be apparent for denial of a motion to amendholding that though the court did not expressly state its reason for denying leave to amend it was apparent what delay and prejudice would be caused by plaintiffs motion which sought to add four new individual defendants as well as additional counts under two federal statutes and a statelaw claim & \n\na broad interpretation of the meaning of the word \u201cdisability,\u201d and imposes a \u201cnon-onerous\u201d burden on a plaintiff at the prima facie stage. Haley v. Cmty. Mercy Health Partners, 2013 WL 322493 (S.D.Ohio Jan. 28, 2013). Even if an impairment lasts less than six months, it can be considered substantially limiting under the ADAAA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(ix). If a plaintiff has a condition that is connected to an underlying disability, this is referred to as a \u201ccharacteristic manifestation\u201d of the qualifying impairment. Cehrs v. Ne. Ohio Alzheimer\u2019s Research Ctr., 155 F.3d 775, 780 (6th Cir.1998). The Sixth Circuit has held that a \u201ccharacteristic manifestation of [the] physical impairment [is] ... part of the underlying impairment.\u201d Roush v. Weastec, Inc., 96 F.3d 840, 844 (6th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). Thus, to determine if Plaintiff meets the holding without applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel that the plaintiff who made sworn statements of total disability in a social security disability application and then testified at her deposition that she was not totally disabled failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the adaholding that a plaintiffs bladder infections were connected with her disability of interstitial cystitisrecognizing that employer has notice of limitation when disability manifests itself to the extent that it would be reasonable to infer that her employer actually knew of the disabilityholding evidence of a 13 permanent partial disability insufficient to establish disability for purposes of adaholding disability discrimination claim barred & \n\nperiod normally was limited to the current fiscal year or legislative session, rarely reaching back more than a year. Though the time period of retroactivity is particularly long here, such a concern is in part offset by the failure of the Plaintiffs to articulate a vested right with which the New Law interferes, as well as by the specific context of trade duties. In examining the nature and circumstances of the New Law, the court notes that customs duties are to an extent unique from other government assessments in that there is no right to import, and where unfair trade remedies apply, those with goods that may be imported rarely can predict with accuracy what the duty will be. See Norwegian Nitrogen Prods. Co. v. United States, 288 U.S. 294, 318, 53 S.Ct. 350, 77 L.Ed. 796 (1933) (<HOLDING>). For example, when goods become the subject of holding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionrecognizing that as with tax rates no one has a legal right to the maintenance of an existing rate or dutyholding that with respect to the eaja the local or national market rate for legal services cannot be a special factor used to increase the rate beyond the statutory rateholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that a utility can claim no rate as a legal right that is other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the commission & \n\nby guileful, covinous, or fraudulent devices and practices are, must, or might be in any ways distur :06-466-HMH, 2007 WL 39428 (D.S.C. Jan. 4, 2007) (unpublished), this court voided a cash transfer of $300,000.00 under the Statute of Elizabeth. In deciding the issue, the court held that \u201c[b]ased on the broad language and equitable nature of the Statute ... the transfer of funds ... is a \u2018transfer\u2019 under the broad and plain language of section 27-23-10(A).\u201d Id. at *3 (citation omitted). Other courts in this district reached analogous conclusions. See In re Hanckel, 512 B.R. 539, 551 (Bankr.D.S.C.2014) (finding an ownership interest in a company subject to the statute and setting aside its transfer as a fraudulent conveyance); In re Hoffman, 194 B.R. 943, 959-61 (Bankr.D.S.C.1995) (<HOLDING>); Future Grp., II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, holding that an emergency petition by an insurance commissioner in her capacity as liquidator of an insurance company that was whollyowned by the debtor holding company was not an exercise of police and regulatory powers because it sought to take control of the debtors assets to allow certain policyholders and creditors to gain a pecuniary advantage over other creditors of the debtors estateholding that the transfers at issue were not fraudulent transfers because they did not diminish the debtors estateholding that a debtor in bankruptcy may claim as exempt the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy insuring the life of the debtor that is payable to a beneficiary other than the debtor under dccode ann 314716a2001 despite the absence of the term cash surrender from the statuteholding transfers of cash totaling 32350000 made by a debtor to an insider creditors company void under the statuteholding that a profit of 35 million in insider trading by the president and ceo of the company was sufficient to plead scienter because that corporate insider sold 40 of his stock holdings in the company and several other corporate insiders sold large positions in the company & \n\nmotive for the Challenged Laws. Before reaching that question, however, the Court notes that Defendants contend once again, in the context of Plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise claim, that housing is not eligible for free exercise protection because it is not a religious use. (See, e.g., Defs.\u2019 Mem. 2.) However, at least in the context of RLUIPA, the Court has already found that \u201cthe building of rabbinical college,\u201d of which student housing would be a part, \u201cfalls squarely within [the] definition of \u2018religious exercise,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cthe multi-family dormitories that [Plaintiffs] seek to build are intended to facilitate religious exercise.\u201d Tartikov, 915 F.Supp.2d at 629. The same analysis is applicable here. Because the definition of religious exercise is quite broad, see WDS I, 386 F.3d at 186 (<HOLDING>), accessory housing, and particularly accessory holding exempt under ors 307130 which relates to other charitable institutions a building that was used as an office for a religious official and religious court and a printing press for a religious publicationholding that the defendant countys two denials of variance permits under the circumstances had to a significantly great extent lessened the prospect of the religious institution being able to construct a temple in the future thus imposing a substantial burden on the religious institutions religious exerciseholding rluipa claim requires prisoner to show he wishes to engage in 1 a religious exercise 2 motivated by a sincerely held belief which exercise 3 is subject to a substantial burden imposed by the governmentholding that religious exercise is any exercise of religion whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief and that the use building or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered religious exerciserecognizing a religious institutions right to free exercise of religion & \n\nyears to life for a first conviction and a penalty of 20 years to life for a second or subsequent conviction\u201d; subsection (b) sets forth what \u201ccould properly [be] characterized as an \u2018aggravated\u2019 continuing criminal enterprise,\u201d carrying a mandatory life term, and requiring additional \u201celements\u201d to be proven. Montalvo argues that his \u201cillegal mandatory life sentence must be corrected to a term authorized by the facts reflected in the basic verdict for a continuing criminal enterprise.\u201d It appears that Montalvo argues that he was convicted of a \u201cbasic\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(a), but sentenced for an \u201caggravated\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(b). So construed, this argument is cognizable under Rule 35(a). Fowler, 794 F.2d at 1449 (<HOLDING>). However, Montalvo\u2019s challenge fails on the holding that rule 35a can be used to challenge sentences that are not authorized by the judgment of convictionholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding that affidavits that are conclusory and based on hearsay can not be used to oppose motion for summary judgmentrecognizing that the phrases can be used interchangeablyholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him & \n\nmet to define the transaction as a security.\" In response to the State's question as to whether promissory notes, in general, can be securities, Hines explained that \"notes that are issued for investment purposes and are not collateralized are\" recognized in the industry as securities while \"[nlotes that are issued in which there is collateral attached ... [are] less likely a security.\" Hines explained in broad terms how those in the industry may characterize a transaction that is not clearly enumerated in the Securities Act as a security. Hines did not tell the jury that the transaction at issue was a security, couch his opinion specifically in terms of what is required under Utah law, or otherwise tell the jury what conclusion to reach. Compare, e.g., Larsen, 865 P.2d at 1861 & n. 10 (<HOLDING>), with Davis, 2007 UT App 18, \u00b617, 155 P.3d 909 holding that an expert that had provided consulting services to the defendant relating to the litigation was not precluded from serving as an expert for the plaintiffholding that an expert witnesss testimony on an ultimate issue was admissible recognizing that the expert did not specifically testify that the defendant was guilty or that as a matter of law the facts satisfied the applicable legal standardholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing plaintiffs expert witness to testify when it also allowed defendants expert witness who disputed the methodology used by plaintiffs expert to testifyholding that the admissibility of expert testimony was governed by state lawholding that an expert is not competent to testify as to statutory interpretation & \n\ndiscrimination charge were invalid, the information sought in the subpoena is nonetheless within the scope of the EEOC\u2019s investigative authority. During the course of the EEOC\u2019s investigation, Milliren additionally alleged that she would be one of only two female LGMs out of 500 LGMs nationwide if she had completed the GMDP and that a female applicant was rejected for a manager position because she had children. Because the EEOC\u2019s investigation into Milliren\u2019s charge of individual gender discrimination revealed potential systemic gender discrimination, the EEOC had the authority to subpoena information relevant to systemic gender discrimination even absent a valid systemic charge by Milliren. See, e.g., EEOC v. Cambridge Tile Mfg. Co., 590 F.2d 205, 206 (6th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). III. We affirm the district court\u2019s order holding that an original eeoc charge is sufficient to support a civil suit under the act for any discrimination developed in the course of a reasonable investigation of that charge provided such discrimination was included in the reasonable cause determination of the eeocholding that statements made to internal investigator of employer were made in an investigation under this subchapter where investigation was pursuant to a charge filed with eeocholding that plaintiff stated a discrimination claim despite not including a discrimination heading in eeoc complaint because the facts included in eeoc complaint were sufficient to trigger an investigation into whether plaintiff suffered an adverse action because of his religionholding that general employment practices are relevant to eeoc investigation of individual disparate treatment claimholding that the eeoc has authority to investigate a broader picture of discrimination that appears during the investigation of an individual charge & \n\ndecision and whatever the significance attributed to Bun\u2019s youth, the trial court found it was outweighed by the severity of his crimes, his criminal history, and his lack of remorse. 6 We note that trial counsel testified at the motion for new trial hearing that he made a conscious decision not to object to Lawson\u2019s testimony because he believed the testimony was admissible and he did not want the judge to think he was \u201chiding anything.\u201d Under Georgia law, a defendant\u2019s juvenile court records can be considered by a trial court in the sentencing phase after conviction of a felony, and in fact, Bun\u2019s juvenile records were admitted at the sentencing hearing for the trial court\u2019s consideration. See OCGA \u00a7 15-11-703. See also Burrell v. State, 258 Ga. 841 (7) (376 SE2d 184) (1989) (<HOLDING>). BENHAM, Justice, dissenting.

Because Appellants brought this case as a holding that the relevant geographic market or appropriate section of the country is the area in which the acquired firm is an actual competitorholding that a contract for an exclusive agency to market a product contains an implied promise to use all reasonable efforts to market the productholding that economic analysis in antitrust context is virtually meaningless if it is entirely unmoored from at least a rough definition of a product and geographic marketholding that changes in the baseball card market between 1965 and 1980 foreclosed any argument that a definition of the relevant market by the federal trade commission could preclude relitigation of the market definition issueholding district court erred by incorporating issue of anticompetitive market effect into its standing analysis confusing antitrust injury with an element of a claim under section 1 of the sherman act and stating district courts approach may have been result of the similar antitrust injury label applied to injury component of antitrust standing analysis and to marketplace harm element under section 1 & \n\nexisting driveways and curb cuts in light of the statutory change that has affected the plaintiff\u2019s ability to use his deeded easement. This conduct is the functional equivalent of the obstruction or impairment contemplated in Sakansky and Bean. The trial court also found that the deviation proposed by the plaintiff would not unduly burden the defendant. We uphold such findings if they are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. See Batakis v. Town of Belmont, 135 N.H. 595, 597, 607 A.2d 956, 957 (1992). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Under these circumstances, the owner of the dominant estate may deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. Cf. Haley v. Colcord, 59 N.H. 7, 9 (1879) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling holding that an easement is not a separate estate when dominant and servient tracts are under the same ownershipholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estateholding that the burden on the servient estate cannot be increased without the consent of the owners of the servient estate and that the owner of the dominant estate to which the appurtenant easement is attached has no power to convey or expand use of that easement in connection with a tract of land owned by anotherrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that dominant tenant may deviate from path of prescriptive easement to extent reasonably necessary to pass around obstruction created by servient tenant & \n\nare you aware of whether or not Eligi\u00f3 [Saenz] has any other method of getting to a public roadway, other than through Mrs. Thrash\u2019s property and through your property? A. He\u2019s even going through my, my easement that I bought outright several times, and also through the ranch, through other places. [Emphasis added] Q. Through what other places sir? A. Through mine and Bazans and Manuel Reyes too. He\u2019s been using it, not right now because he locked the gates. [Emphasis added] Xavier Reyes\u2019 testimony raises a genuine issue of material fact on whether the Saenzes have other possible legal means of access to their property and on whether access across the Reyeses\u2019 property is a necessity, as opposed to a mere convenience. See Mitchell v. Castellaw, 151 Tex. 56, 246 S.W.2d 163, 168 (1952) (<HOLDING>). CONCLUSION We conclude the Saenzes failed to holding it is a question of factholding that whether the defendants confession was voluntary was a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo reviewholding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that probable cause determination presents a mixed question of law and factholding the question of necessity is one of mixed law and fact and accordingly one for the fact finder in the ordinary case & \n\nboat. All six (Martinez-Rios, Ramirez-Fajardo, Castaneda-Marin, Sanchez-Martinez, Ortiz-Cotoa and Carmargo-Silvera) were charged with conspiracy to possess and with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a) and 1903(j), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Carmargo-Silv-era pled guilty and testified on behalf of the government. The remaining five went to trial and were convicted. Discussion Defendants claim the district court erred by deciding, as a matter of law, that the MS was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as required by 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a). Defendants claim that jurisdiction is an element of the offense and should have been submitted for determination by the jury. See U.S. v. Ayarza-Garcia, 819 F.2d 1043, 1048-49 (11th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). Defendants claim they objected to the holding that claim construction is an issue of law for the court not a question of fact for the juryholding that generally the question of waiver and estoppel is a question of factrecognizing that under district of columbia law what the parties deem to be the material elements of their agreement either set forth in or absent from those documents is largely a question of fact for the jury and concluding in that case that whether an enforceable oral contract was created and was subsequently breached is a question of fact for the jury to decide not this courtholding it is a question of factholding under predecessor to 46 usc app 1903a that jurisdictional element of crime is question of fact for jury to decide & \n\n\u201d id. at 1281 (quoting Compact art. VII(d)(l)), to hold that the EIS must include \u201cat a minimum, a \u2018reasonably complete\u2019 discussion of mitigation measures including \u2018analytical data\u2019 regarding whether the available measures would achieve the required result,\u201d id. Two caveats must accompany the League court\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute\u2019s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 351-52, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989) (<HOLDING>). Under the Compact, an EIS needs to include holding that an eis must consider the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided by discussing possible mitigation measuresrecognizing that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense a party must plead and proveholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleadedholding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by a true inconsistencyholding that perfunctory description of mitigation measures was inadequate & \n\nclearly states that the precise location of an easement need not be designated for the easement to be valid. See McConnell v. Golden, 104 R.I. 657, 663, 247 A.2d 909, 912 (1968). Instead, the holders of the dominant estate are entitled to a convenient, suitable, and accessible easement of way. Id. Therefore, despite the lack of specificity in the original writing that created the easement, plaintiffs are entitled to the use of \u201ca rear roadway, at least ten feet in width,\u201d to be \u201ckept open so that vehicles can reach the rear of the building [once] known as First National Store Since this language was referenced in defendant\u2019s deed, and because it has not been modified by subsequent instrument, it remains in effect. See Crawford Realty Co. v. Ostrow, 89 R.I. 12, 19, 150 A.2d 5, 9 (1959) (<HOLDING>). There is no question that defendant caused a holding that an express easement ran with the dominant estateholding that increase in vehicular traffic arising out of the subdivision of the dominant estate was reasonably foreseeable and so did not restrict the rights of the dominant ownerrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that the dominant tenement a power company rather than the servient tenement had affirmative duties of inspection and repair related to its easementholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estate & \n\nand Key were unreliable because they were not asked to identify him in a photographic lineup before trial and their testimony about the appearance of the surviving assailant differed to some extent. However, Appellant did not object to the admission of this eyewitness identification evidence at trial. See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196-201 (93 SCt 375, 34 LE2d 401) (1972) (discussing the due process protection against the admission of evidence deriving from suggestive identification procedures). And it is firmly established that the determination of a witness\u2019s credibility, including eyewitness identification, is within the exclusive province of the jury. See Reeves v. State, 288 Ga. 545, 546 (705 SE2d 159) (2011). See also Walker v. State, 295 Ga. 688, 690 (763 SE2d 704) (2014) (<HOLDING>); Vega v. State, 285 Ga. 32, 33 (673 SE2d 223) holding a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have beenholding that expert testimony should not be admitted as to a matter that is obviously within the common knowledge of jurors because such testimony almost by definition can be of no assistanceholding that because the special master saw the witnesses and heard the testimony he has broad discretion in determining credibilityholding that a trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to exclude testimony of a witness for an alleged sequestration violation where no impermissible harmonization of testimony could be inferred from the witnesss reading of the newspaper in the absence of any evidence that this testimony was based on what he readholding that whether and to what extent a witnesss testimony should be believed is a matter to be decided by the jury that saw and heard the testimony not by an appellate court reviewing a transcript & \n\nApp 8, 288 Wis. 2d 804, 709 N.W.2d 497, the defendant bears a heavy burden in attempting to convince a reviewing court to set aside a jury's verdict on insufficiency of the evidence grounds. Id., \u00b6 22 (citing State v. Allbaugh, 148 Wis. 2d 807, 808-09, 436 N.W.2d 898 (Ct. App. 1989)). \u00b6 23. In Booker's trial, the girls' and the detective's testimonies regarding the content of the tape were admitted to prove the \"harmful material\" element of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 948.11. All of the\u2019 witnesses explained that the video's dominant focus was on nudity and explicit sexual acts and suggested that the video had no additional plot line, meaningful dialogue or other notable qualities or characteristics. The girls characterized it as a \"porno\" video. Their descriptions of what they saw provi Cir. 1969) (<HOLDING>); State v. Tee & Bee, Inc., 229 Wis. 2d 446, recognizing that the dc circuit has stated that by attempting to evaluate the credibility of opposing experts and the persuasiveness of competing studies the district court conflates the questions of the admissibility of expert testimony and the weight appropriately to be accorded such testimony by a factfinder holding that issues of prurient appeal and offensiveness to contemporary community standards were appropriately decided by a jury notwithstanding the lack of expert testimonyholding that whether and to what extent a witnesss testimony should be believed is a matter to be decided by the jury that saw and heard the testimony not by an appellate court reviewing a transcriptholding expert testimony was not required where jury is capable of determining existence of dutyholding that defendants truthfulness and the credibility of and weight to be given expert medical testimony are issues of fact for jury & \n\nyears to life for a first conviction and a penalty of 20 years to life for a second or subsequent conviction\u201d; subsection (b) sets forth what \u201ccould properly [be] characterized as an \u2018aggravated\u2019 continuing criminal enterprise,\u201d carrying a mandatory life term, and requiring additional \u201celements\u201d to be proven. Montalvo argues that his \u201cillegal mandatory life sentence must be corrected to a term authorized by the facts reflected in the basic verdict for a continuing criminal enterprise.\u201d It appears that Montalvo argues that he was convicted of a \u201cbasic\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(a), but sentenced for an \u201caggravated\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(b). So construed, this argument is cognizable under Rule 35(a). Fowler, 794 F.2d at 1449 (<HOLDING>). However, Montalvo\u2019s challenge fails on the holding that rule 35a can be used to challenge sentences that are not authorized by the judgment of convictionholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding that affidavits that are conclusory and based on hearsay can not be used to oppose motion for summary judgmentrecognizing that the phrases can be used interchangeablyholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him & \n\nfalse on \u201c[pjrimarily medical evidence but also what was related to [him] about her visit to California by family members\u201d as well as McCullough\u2019s testimony. Id. However, trial counsel did not introduce medical evidence even though such a report existed, or the testimony of family members, or any other evidence to prove the falsity of the California Claim. Id. at 125-126. McCullough\u2019s counsel also did not object when the prosecutor, clearly improperly, referred to uncharged misconduct during closing argument or during rebuttal when the prosecutor stated: \u201cCalifornia, I wish I could charge it, but that\u2019s not my jurisdiction. I wish I could charge in California what he did to her, what she testified that he did to her, what she told Diane Bowers that he did to he 978 (Ind.Ct.App.1995) (<HOLDING>). Trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Bowers holding that trial counsels failure to object to the prosecutors repeated pervasive and clearly improper references during closing arguments to similar transactions committed by the defendant constituted deficient performance and amounted to prejudice that required a new trialholding that omissions of informants criminal history from warrant affidavit did not support suppression where the affiant did not know the exact nature of the criminal historyholding that trial counsels performance in failing to object move to strike or request an admonishment of the jury with respect to the defendants criminal history was deficient and that it could not be said that the references to the defendants criminal history did not impact the jurys decision where the evidence was not overwhelming and reversing for a new trialholding that failure to object to properly admitted evidence was not deficient performance by trial counselholding a court may consider a defendants criminal history even if that history is included in the defendants criminal history category & \n\nof interference, in the context of an easement acquired by condemnation. In Blair v. Milwaukee Elec. Ry. & Light Co., 187 Wis. 552, 556-57, 203 N.W. 912 (1925), the court held that when an electric company has a right-of-way, it has the right to make a reasonable clearance for its wires by cutting down and trimming trees. \"To hold otherwise,\" the court noted, \"would be to jeopardize the efficient operation of the line and perhaps to subject to greater peril the public or those who may have occasion to be on or near the wires, for it is a well known fact that, especially in wet weather, trees touching high-voltage electric wires transmit the current to the ground, where it may do damage to persons or property.\" Id.; see also Klump v. Cybulski, 274 Wis. 604, 613-14, 81 N.W.2d 42 (1957) (<HOLDING>). The reasoning of these cases leads us to holding that the court must determine rights in condemnation ujnless there is found in the deed of the plaintiffs granting the easement to the railroad company language indicating a purpose or operating to pass a larger or more extended right or easement than that which would have been acquired by judgment in condemnation proceedings holding the easement a power company acquires by condemnation may include the right to cut down trees to provide sufficient clearance for its wiresholding that permanent easement arising from condemnation of pipeline easement reduced property value by 20recognizing that an easement may entitle the easement owner to do acts which were not for the easement would constitute a nuisanceholding that when federal government acquires property through condemnation it must account for state and local property taxes interest and penalties & \n\n\u201cregardless of whether the respondent has been tried, acquitted, or convicted in a court for the alleged criminal offense.\u201d This language makes it clear that a disciplinary violation premised on a violation of law is separate from the initiation or outcome of criminal proceedings based on the same conduct. Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla. Bar v. Brown, 905 So.2d 76, 81 (Fla.2005); see also Fla. Bar v. Riggs, 944 So.2d 167, 171 (Fla.2006) (<HOLDING>); Fla. Bar v. Barley, 881 So.2d 163, 169 holding that attorneys engaging in conduct involving dishonesty amounts to conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice lawholding intent as an element for disciplining an attorney for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentation is proven by establishing that the conduct was deliberate or knowingholding that an infamous crime under the arkansas constitution is a crime involving elements of deceit and dishonestyholding that reliance is not an element to be proven under securities fraud in indianaholding that in the context of federal immigration law the amount of loss to the victim of fraud or deceit does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit but rather refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed fraud or deceit & \n\nTo issue a certificate, FERC must determine that the public will be well-served by the company\u2019s proposed development; the Commission may also impose terms and conditions it believes the public convenience and necessity require. The Act further provides that [w]hen any holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity cannot acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with the owner of property to the compensation to be paid [for the owner\u2019s property interests] ... it may acquire the same by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court of the United States for the district in which such property may be located, or in the State courts. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h); see Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. An Exclusive Gas Storage Easement, 776 F.2d 125 (6th Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). The company\u2019s exercise of this eminent domain holding that floating barge moored to shore remaining in same place for approximately seven years and used as work platform to clean and strip cargo and gas from barges was not a vesselholding that the natural gas act authorizes acquisition of gas storage easements by eminent domainholding retroactive application of the act to prosecution that was pending before the effective date of the act was precluded because the act is prospectiveholding that an individual is presumed to intend the natural consequences of the individuals actionsholding that under fedrcivp 71a federal procedure governs condemnation actions brought under the natural gas act & \n\nmet to define the transaction as a security.\" In response to the State's question as to whether promissory notes, in general, can be securities, Hines explained that \"notes that are issued for investment purposes and are not collateralized are\" recognized in the industry as securities while \"[nlotes that are issued in which there is collateral attached ... [are] less likely a security.\" Hines explained in broad terms how those in the industry may characterize a transaction that is not clearly enumerated in the Securities Act as a security. Hines did not tell the jury that the transaction at issue was a security, couch his opinion specifically in terms of what is required under Utah law, or otherwise tell the jury what conclusion to reach. Compare, e.g., Larsen, 865 P.2d at 1861 & n. 10 (<HOLDING>), with Davis, 2007 UT App 18, \u00b617, 155 P.3d 909 holding that an expert that had provided consulting services to the defendant relating to the litigation was not precluded from serving as an expert for the plaintiffholding that an expert witnesss testimony on an ultimate issue was admissible recognizing that the expert did not specifically testify that the defendant was guilty or that as a matter of law the facts satisfied the applicable legal standardholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing plaintiffs expert witness to testify when it also allowed defendants expert witness who disputed the methodology used by plaintiffs expert to testifyholding that the admissibility of expert testimony was governed by state lawholding that an expert is not competent to testify as to statutory interpretation & \n\nnot testify as a nonexpert fact witness about what he did and directly observed during the reenactment. Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\nan enforceable contract, a party must provide evidence that demonstrates that the parties reached a mutual understanding, they exchanged consideration, and they understood the essential terms of their bargain.

The court left open what the custody arrangements would be thereafter, though its order recited custody would remain in the plaintiff until further order of the court.

We can draw the same analogy to the holding order of contempt sentence without statutory opportunity for appeal was in error but nevertheless involved a judicial act subject to judicial immunityrecognizing that absolute judicial immunity is not grounded in any special esteem for those who perform judicial functions and certainly not from a desire to shield abuses of office but because any lesser degree of immunity could impair the judicial process itselfholding that individuals acting in a legislative capacity at a regional level are entitled to absolute immunityholding that a hearing officer acting in a judicial capacity was entitled to claim judicial immunity and could not be compelled to give testimony about his mental process in deciding a caserecognizing judicial immunity for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction & \n\n96 S.Ct. 984. However, \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate\u2019s preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immunity.\u201d Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606. A defendant pleading absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question. Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 487, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991). The defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity prevails only in part. They are correct that they have absolute immunity for offering the tape recording into evidence at the hearing because in doing so they were functioning as advocates. See Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. 984 (<HOLDING>); see also Butz, 438 U.S. at 516-517, 98 S.Ct. holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from 1983 suits for initiating a prosecution and presenting the case at trialholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding prosecutors immune from civil suits for initiating prosecutions and presenting casesholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nnot to place the tapes in the investigation file, depends upon the function he was performing at the time the conduct occurred. He is absolutely immune from liability for damages if he was gathering evidence to present to the trier of fact. See Ybarra, 723 F.2d at 679. Bogan and Ingram would be protected only by qualified immunity, however, if they were conducting an investigation to determine whether probable cause existed to arrest Broam and Manning. See, e.g., Powers v. Coe, 728 F.2d 97, 103 (2d Cir.1984) (determining that, \u201cwhen a prosecutor engages in or authorizes and directs illegal wiretaps\u201d and \u201cthe wiretapping is ... investigative in nature,\u201d the prosecutors are only \u201centitled to qualified, rather than absolute, immunity\u201d); Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515, 524 (9th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>); Guerro v. Mulhearn, 498 F.2d 1249, 1255-56 holding officers engaged in search entitled to immunityholding that a judge was not entitled to absolute immunity for firing an employeeholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that when prosecutors joined in implementing the wiretap they engaged in an act that was ordinarily related to police activity and were not entitled to absolute immunityholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nabsolutely immune from damages liability under \u00a71983 for this conduct. Relying on its decision in Salyer v. Patrick, 874 F. 2d 374 (CA6 1989), the Court of Appeals affirmed. I would grant certiorari to address petitioner\u2019s challenge to that ruling. In Salyer, the Sixth Circuit held that, \u201cdue to their quasiprosecutorial function in the initiation of child abuse proceedings,\u201d social workers are absolutely immune from liability for filing juvenile abuse petitions. Id., at 378. Other courts addressing the question have agreed that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 in some instances, depending on their conduct and the terms of the state laws pursuant to which they acted. See, e. g., Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dept. of Social Servs., 812 F. 2d 1154, 1157 (CA9) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 829 (1987); Vosburg holding that social services attorneys were entitled to absolute immunity for actions related to the prosecution of child neglect and delinquency proceedingsholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity when prosecuting child delinquency petitionsholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity in performing quasiprosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuit of child dependency proceedingsholding that child social workers are entitled to absolute immunity for their actions on behalf of the state in preparing for initiating and prosecuting dependency hearings as well as the formulation and presentation of recommendations to the court in the course of such proceedings & \n\nclaims. This immunity applies to the section 1983 claims. Individual immunity is not necessary for the RLUIPA claims. RLUIPA provides a cause of action against \u201cgovernments\u201d and does not appear to allow causes of action against individuals. (A section 1983 claim' against an individual could be based upon a denial of such a statutory right (see Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980)), but such a claim would be a section 1983 claim, not an individual RLUIPA claim.) In any event, to the extent Plaintiffs assert or can assert a claim against individual defendants in their personal capacities specifically under RLUIPA, the Court would find the same immunity and such claims are dismissed. See Mishler v. Clift, 191 F.3d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) (citing Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, holding that as a general rule interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity governmental immunity public official immunity statutory immunity or any other type of immunity are not appealable under the maryland collateral order doctrineholding that prosecutors have absolute immunityholding trial court improperly granted dismissal on ground of immunity because the defendant had qualified statutory immunity rather than absolute immunityholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitrecognizing that absolute immunity is immunity from charges of either constitutional or statutory violations & \n\nis most commonly used in other contexts to refer to proceedings initiated before a court. See Iowa Code \u00a7 611.2 (\"A civil action is a proceeding in a court of justice in which one party, known as the plaintiff, demands against another party, known as the defendant, the enforcement or protection of a private right, or the prevention or redress of a private wrong.\u201d) (emphasis added); see also Kelso v.

McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 312-13, 93 S.Ct. 2018, 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973) (citation omitted). Before defendants in the instant case can invoke legislative immunity, they have the burden of establishing both of the following: (1) that the acts giving rise to the harm alleged in the complaint were undertaken when defendants were acting in their legislative capacities under the functional test set forth in Bogan; and (2) that the particular relief sought would enjoin defendants in their legislative capacities, and not in some other capacity in which they would not be entitled to legislative immunity. See State Emp., 494 F.3d at 89; see also Canary v. Osborn, 211 F.3d 324, 328 (6th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Here, Defendants argue that by issuing the holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the burden is on the plaintiffholding that city council is entitled to absolute legislative immunity from claim under the age discrimination in employment actholding that the burden is on defendant as the party invoking removal jurisdiction to establish the existence of a sufficient amount in controversyholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nfor the State. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 430 94 (\u201cWe can see no substantial difference between the function of the agency attorney in presenting evidence in an agency hearing and the function of the prosecutor who brings evidence before a court.\u201d). Moreover, the absolute immunity the defendants enjoy for offering the composite tape into evidence is not defeated by Cig-netti\u2019s allegations that they did so maliciously or in bad-faith because they knew or should have known that the composite tape was fabricated. See e.g. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 409, 96 S.Ct. 984 (concluding that absolute prosecutorial immunity precluded a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that a prosecutor had knowingly used perjured testimony and deliberately suppressed exculpatory material at trial); Burns, 500 U.S. at 478, 111 S.Ct. 1934 (<HOLDING>); see also Kulwicki v.

See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1034-35; Thompson, 25 F.3d at 1562-63; Rowe, 676 F.2d at 528. Accordingly, to succeed on her immunity claim, Kozak must demonstrate that an agreement was reached with the government under the terms of which the government would refrain from prosecuting her in exchange for her cooperation. In order to create a valid contract, the parties must come to a \u201cmeeting of the minds.\u201d Restatement (Second) Of Contracts \u00a7 17 comment c (1981). Thus, in the parlance of contract law, to succeed on her transactional immunity claim, Kozak must demonstrate at least a meeting of the minds that the government would refrain from prosecuting her in exchange for her cooperation in the investigation. See McHan, 101 F.3d at 1034 (<HOLDING>); United States v.

Defendants filed a Suggestion of Mootness [Doc. # 77] on June 6, 2000. Attached is the Affidavit of David C. Lanier. Mr. Lanier is the registrar at UNC, and he testifies that Ms. Jennings has graduated from UNC. (Lanier Aff. \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs have not responded. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), courts can look beyond the pleadings to determine a matter on standing. Smith v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 290 F.3d 201, 205 (4th Cir.2002). Only Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) converts to a summary judgment when additional evidence is examined. Id. 5 . If preemption is found, Plaintiffs will be precluded from suing officials in their individual capacities under Title IX. See Kinman v. Omaha Pub. Sch.

The Supreme Court recognizes that Federal holding title ix does not support an action against official in an individual capacityholding that in a bivens action service upon employee in his official capacity does not amount to service in his individual capacityholding that a claim for damages exists in an action to enforce title ixholding that a claim for retaliation does not lie under title ixholding that the doctrine of qualified immunity does not protect a government official who is sued in an official capacity under title vii because title vii does not impose personal liability & \n\napparent on the statute\u2019s face and the question of their enforcement duties, if any, was not considered in the decision declaring the statutes unconstitutional, nor were the merits of the proposition otherwise litigated. Moreover, where, as here, the state defendants include members of the judiciary who \u201cenjoy absolute immunity from damages liability for acts performed in their judicial eapaeitie[s],\u201d Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 735, 100 S.Ct. at 1976, it is particularly important to give careful consideration as to whether liability is properly based upon the exercise of their enforcement authority since imposition of a fees award might be erroneously premised upon acts or omissions as to which the defendants are immune. See id. at 738, 100 S.Ct. at 1977 (<HOLDING>). Unquestionably, with respect to the holding trial court had no authority to award attorneys fees when arbitrator had stated he would not award attorneys feesholding that a district court may award attorneys fees while the merits are on appealholding merely that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of attorneys feesholding that an award of attorneys fees under supreme court rule 38 precursor to rule 222 did not preempt an award of attorneys fees to which one is otherwise entitled and thus appellant could seek an award of attorneys fees pursuant to section 1577300 which permits an award of fees for a party prevailing in an action against a state agencyholding district jourts award of attorneys fees was erroneous since court relied upon a theory of liability under which defendants had immunity & \n\nand ministerial acts in its application of the qualified public official immunity doctrine. See, e.g., Parker v. State, 337 Md. 271, 284, 653 A.2d 436, 442 (1995) (noting that \u201cthe Court has distinguished between the qualified and narrower immunity for discretionary acts generally accorded to public officials, and absolute judicial immunity, which ... applies [to judges] regardless of the nature of the tort\u201d (emphasis added)); Mandel, 320 Md. at 110, 576 A.2d at 769 (recognizing that \u201c \u2018the Maryland cases seem to indicate that discretionary action [of officials] will be protected only in the absence of malice\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Eliason v.

As discussed supra, Plaintiffs claim that defendants acts were ultra vires, without authority, and null and void. Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants were acting beyond the scope of their authority as public officials. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the Court finds that the allegations are sufficiently pled to defeat Defendants\u2019 motion at this stage of the litigation. See Collin Cnty. Tex. v. Homeowners Ass\u2019n for Values Essential to Neighborhoods (HAVEN), 654 F.Supp. 943, 949 (N.D.Tex.1987) (<HOLDING>). At this stage of the litigation, based upon holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants actions were ultra vires in character and that they acted outside of their capacities as public officials arguably deprives the defendants of rule 12b6 dismissal based upon an absolute immunity defenseholding that a plaintiffs breach of contract claim failed because he could make no showing that the individual defendants acted in their individual capacities when they signed the contract on behalf of the employer housing authorityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that the public policy considerations supporting public officials immunity required that the immunity be applied to bar contribution actions as well as direct actions & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N. LaSalle, 190 B.R. at 585 (noting \u201cthe lack of any clear standard for determining the fairness of a discrimination in the treatment of classes under a chapter 11 plan\u201d and that \u201cthe limits of fairness in this context have not been established\u201d). Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\nought to be subject to liability under \u00a7 10:5-12(a) because \u201cpublic officers\u201d are specifically included in the \u00a7 10:5-5(e) definition of \u201cemployer.\u201d Although \u201cpublic officers\u201d is not defined in the LAD, it is difficult to conceive of a definition of that term that does not encompass a police inspector and a police captain, which are, respectively, the second and third highest ranking positions in the Atlantic City Police Department. All of this is to say that, even if we did not have the benefit of New Jersey state court decisions and were completely left to our own devices, the question of whether Rifiee and Madamba could be liable under LAD \u00a7 10:5-12(a) is, as the majority acknowledges, a close one.

Allen named as defendants the Casino, the Tribe, Mattie Mayhew, and John Does 1 thru 300, against whom he asserted various employment, civil rights, and conspiracy claims.

The magistrate judge assumed without analysis that the Tribe\u2019s immunity extended to the Casino. The magistrate judge found that the only remaining claim was for false accusations against Mayhew.

Because the arbitration agreement is still in holding that an arbitration agreement in an employee handbook was illusory where the employer expressly reserved a right to unilaterally rescind any provisions of the handbookholding that contractual relationship between student and university did not include terms of the handbook because university retained right to unilaterally modify terms of handbook without notice plaintiff neither negotiated for nor assented to terms of contract and relevant correspondence did not call special attention to handbookholding that no modification of the original employment contract occurred when the employer unilaterally issued a new handbookholding that an agreement to arbitrate is illusory if as here the employer can unilaterally modify the contractholding that employee handbook did not give rise to implied contract where it stated that it was not a contract and that employment was terminable at will & \n\nby the following: (i) where there is a contract of employment providing for a specific duration and termination without just cause occurs before expiration of-that duration, see Rosen v. Gulf Shores, Inc., 610 So.2d 366 (Miss.1992); (ii) where termination is retaliatory, because the employee reports or refuses to participate in an unlawful act,, see McArn v. Allied Bruce-Terminix Co., 626 So.2d 603 (Miss.1993); and (iii) where a handbook does not sufficiently preserve the at-will nature of employment and the employer \u201ccompletely ignores\u201d specific progressive disciplinary penalties for rule infractions, thus giving rise to contractual obligations, see Bobbitt, 603 So.2d 356. See Byest v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., No. 4:13-CV-0009-DMB-JMV, 2014 WL 3891295, at *7 (N.D.Miss. Aug. 7, 2014) (<HOLDING>).

Massachusetts courts have so recognized the legal effect of employee manuals. See O\u2019Brien v. New England Telephone & Telegraph Company, 422 Mass. 686, 693, 664 N.E.2d 843 (\u201cOf course, the provisions of a personnel manual on analysis may grant no rights. [Jackson v.

Guest Services argued that Ms. Washington was an at-will employee and that her allegations, even if true, did not bring her within the only public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine that had been recognized by this court at the time. See Adams v. George W. Cochran & Co., 597 A.2d 28, 34 (D.C.1991) (<HOLDING>). On July 23, 1996, the trial judge granted holding that an atwill employee may not be discharged for refusal to violate the lawholding that an atwill employee may bring a cause of action under section 1981holding that an atwill employee can be discharged for any reason or no reason unless employee is discharged for reasons that contravene a clear mandate of public policyholding that absent a law or collective bargaining agreement a municipal employee is an employee atwillholding that an atwill employee may not recover for discriminatory discharge under section 1981 because the atwill relationship was not sufficiently contractual under tennessee law & \n\nexpert witness, testified that the existence of an annual renewable employment agreement between the Foundation and D\u2019Unger was consistent with generally accepted accounting practices and corporate governance standards regarding how corporate officers are employed and compensated. The Foundation\u2019s by-laws provide that \u201c[ejection or appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.\u201d In light of that evidence, D\u2019Un-ger\u2019s testimony about his understanding of the one-year, renewable term of his employment with the Foundation, standing alone, will not support a finding that the Foundation agreed to an employment contract that limited its right to terminate D\u2019Unger. See Williams v. First Tenn. Nat\u2019l Corp., 97 S.W.3d 798, 804 (Tex.App.Dallas 2003, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). D\u2019Unger was required to present probative holding that language in employee handbook stating that it was not to be considered as creating terms and conditions of an employment contract and that the employment relationship was employment atwill was sufficiently explicit to preclude the creation of implied contractual obligations as a matter of lawholding where employee handbook and employment offer letter disclaimed creation of employment contract that employees testimony of his understanding of terms of agreement did not raise fact issue of specific express and clear agreement contradicting the express provisions of the personnel manual and the employment offer letterholding offer of continued atwill employment did not constitute consideration for the arbitration agreementholding that under arkansas law employment is atwill unless personnel manual or employment agreement contains express provision that employee shall not be discharged except for causeholding that whether a personnel policy manual modifies an employment contract is a question of fact & \n\nof the changes, he has accepted the changes as a matter of law.\u201d Hathaway v. General Mills, Inc., 711 S.W.2d 227, 229 (Tex. 1986). {15} It appears that the district court assumed, without deciding, that under Texas law Flemma would be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Program. We agree with Defendants that, under Texas law, mutual assent and acceptance of the Program and hence an agreement to arbitrate existed between Halliburton and Flemma. Flemma does not argue otherwise. {16} Asa Halliburton employee living and working in T exas when notice of the Program was initially sent to his address, Flemma\u2019s continued employment constituted acceptance of the terms of the Program, including the arbitration requirement under Texas law. See In re Halliburton Co., 80 S.W.3d at 568-69 (<HOLDING>). Halliburton subsequently reaffirmed the offer holding the employee had 180 days to file a claim from the date the employee received final definitive and unequivocal notice of an adverse employment actionholding that language in employee handbook stating that it was not to be considered as creating terms and conditions of an employment contract and that the employment relationship was employment atwill was sufficiently explicit to preclude the creation of implied contractual obligations as a matter of lawholding that an employee accepted as a matter of law changes to an employment agreement by continuing employment with the company after he received notice of the changesholding covenant in an employment agreement executed some 12 years after the initial taking of employment was not incident to the taking of employmentholding that reassignments without salary or work changes do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions in employment discrimination claims & \n\nwill not state a cause of action for retaliatory discharge.\u201d Turner, 233 Ill. 2d at 502-03. The Complaint here fails to state a cause of action. Although attorney honesty and fidelity are vital to the legal system and a matter in the public interest, we do not believe that a former law firm employee can be immune from the general rule of at-will employment merely by complaining to the Firm and its attorneys prior to being fired about deceitful but seemingly legal billing practices he no longer wishes to participate in. While we do not condone the Firm\u2019s alleged misconduct here, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs allegation of \u201chonesty and fidelity\u201d in the legal system satisfies the supreme court\u2019s \u201cnarrow definition of public policy\u201d in retaliatory discharge cases. Id. at 507-08 (<HOLDING>). We affirm the dismissal of the Complaint. holding that based on the narrow scope of a retaliatory discharge action the general concept of patient safety by itself is simply inadequate to justify finding an exception to the general rule of atwill employmentholding that an atwill employee who alleges retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers compensation claim has stated a cause of action under pennsylvania lawrecognizing the tort of retaliatory dischargerecognizing general rulerecognizing narrow whistleblower exception to the atwill doctrine & \n\nunder the ADA. The District Court denied his motion for leave to file a second amended complaint. In September 2011, the District Court granted summary judgment for Cryovac on Spring\u2019s FMLA claims. Spring filed a timely notice of appeal. II. A. State-Law Claims Spring argues that the District Court erred in dismissing his state-law claim for retaliatory discharge. We review the District Court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss de novo. Marcavage v. Nat'l Park Serv., 666 F.3d 856, 858 (3d Cir.2012). Spring contends that under Pennsylvania law, which recognizes an exception to the at-will employment doctrine for a termination based on filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim, he also has a claim for retaliatory discharge. See Shick v. Shirey, 552 Pa. 590, 716 A.2d 1231, 1232 (1998) (<HOLDING>). The Pennsylvania courts have yet to enumerate holding that employee must prove that the sole reason for their discharge was their filing of a workers compensation claim to prevail on a claim of wrongful discharge under marylands workers compensation actholding that because maryland law expressly creates right to file workers compensation claim action exists for wrongful discharge for termination based solely on the filing of a workers compensation claimrecognizing a tort action when employee was dismissed for filing a workers compensation claimholding that an atwill employee who alleges retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers compensation claim has stated a cause of action under pennsylvania lawrecognizing retaliatory discharge tort implied by the workers compensation act & \n\nJersey Racing Comm\u2019n, 113 F.3d 1313, 1318 (3d Cir. 1997) (\u201cIn order to succeed on a claim of deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to termination of a specific employment position, a plaintiff must first establish a property interest in the employment.\u201d) (citing Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972)). \u201cTo have a property interest in a job or job benefit, an employee must have a legitimate claim of entitlement, not just a unilateral expectation.\u201d Latessa, 113 F.3d at 1318 (citing Roth, 408 U.S. at 577). \u201cCognizable property interests can be created by sources such as state law and implied or express contracts.\u201d Miller v. Twp. of Readington, 39 Fed. Appx. 774, 775-76 (3d Cir. 2002) 1987) (<HOLDING>). The burden thus shifts to Davis to show that holding that court erred as matter of law in failing to enter judgment for employer at close of plaintiffs implied employment contract actionholding that once the plaintiffs fixed term of employment expired he had no property interest as a matter of lawholding that plaintiffs had no vested interest in former interpretation of state lawholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that an assistant professor hired for a fixed term of one academic year had no property interest in his job because the terms of his employment allowed that his contract not be renewed & \n\nhas been \u201cofficially declared\u201d in a statute or municipal regulation, or in the Constitution, that a new exception [to the at-will doctrine] is needed.\u2019 \u201d Fingerhut v.

Critically, we have repeatedly acknowledged the limited reach of this tort and indicated that a plaintiff seeking recovery thereunder must show that her protected activity was the predominant cause of her termination. See Wallace v. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, 715 A.2d 873, 886 (D.C.1998) (<HOLDING>); see also Fingerhut, 738 A.2d at 803-04 & n. 7 recognizing public policy exception to atwill doctrineholding that an employee could maintain a claim for constructive discharge in violation of virginias public policy exception to the employment atwill doctrinerecognizing such an exceptionholding that it takes more than the plaintiff has alleged to invoke a public policy exception to the atwill doctrine and that plaintiffs wrongful termination claim failed where her own complaint reveals that she was not terminated solely or even substantially for engaging in conduct protected by such an exception footnote omittedrecognizing exception to atwill employment doctrine where employee is terminated by employer for refusing to violate municipal regulation & \n\noverreaching, or compromised independence). We do not presume to draft precise disclaimers for each of appellants\u2019 four claims; we leave that task to the agency in the first instance. Nor do we rule out the possibility that where evidence in support of a claim is outweighed by evidence against the claim, the FDA could deem it incurable by a disclaimer and ban it outright. For example, if the weight of the evidence were against the hypothetical claim that \u201cConsumption of Vitamin E reduces the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d the agency might reasonably determine that adding a disclaimer such as \u201cThe FDA has determined that no evidence supports this claim\u201d would not suffice to mitigate the claim\u2019s misleadingness. Cf. FTC v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 778 F.2d 35, 42-43 (D.C.Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). Finally, while we are skeptical that the holding that defendants statement that it owned the rights to a trademark did not give rise to a false advertising claim under the lanham actholding in a false advertising case under the lanham act that a proposed disclaimer would not suffice to cure the misleadingness of an advertising claimholding that there must be a causal connection between an insureds advertising and an alleged injury to trigger coverage for an advertising injuryholding that both lanham act false advertising claim and a false advertising claim made under section 349 or section 350 require a showing that the advertisement was false or misleadingholding that while under a false association claim parties need not be direct competitors under a false advertising claim they do & \n\n(1952). The general test to resolve this question employs the following factors: 1) the form and manner of the employment contract concerning provisions of full-time or part-time employment; 2) whether the employment contract provides for vacation time, sick leave, or a retirement program; 3) the extent an nature of control the individual has over the execution of his duties; 4) the form of payment; and 5) the ownership status of equipment which is utilized. Rivera v. Hospital Universitario, 762 F.Supp. at 17. No one factor, by itself, is sufficient to establish an individual as an independent contractor. Id. In fact, it is unusual to find cases where the distinction between an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and an employee is crystal clear. Nazario v. Gonzalez, 101 D.P.R. 569, 572 (1973) (<HOLDING>).

Although in his Original Petition the plaintiff alleges in a conclusory fashion that he was a public employee working pursuant to a contract of employment, the plaintiff fails to allege any facts to indicate that a contract of employment existed and further fails to provide any competent summary judgment evidence to support this allegation. The City of Was-kom\u2019s ordinance provides that the term of office of the municipal judge shall be by appointment of the City Council by a majority vote of the governing body. The City\u2019s ordinance does not appear to create a contract of employment. See Youngblood v. City of Galveston, 920 F.Supp. 10B (S.D.Tex. 1996) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiff does not even allege that the holding that plaintiff did not have dueprocessprotected property interest because he failed to sufficiently plead a rule or other mutually explicit understanding from the manual or otherwise bridling the reason for which he could be terminated and thereby creating a sufficient expectation of continued employment the critical component herewithout alleging such a bridle plaintiff was an atwill employee consequently he lacked a property interest in his continued employmentholding that former municipal judge did not have property interest in continued employmentholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that property interest in continued expectation of public employment does not include right to actually occupy positionholding an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was insufficient to create a property interest in continued employment under montanas statutory scheme for at will employment & \n\nthe Court deems the \u00a7 523(a)(9) claim to have been tried by the consent of parties, and the Court will therefore consider whether this debt should be excepted from discharge under either \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(6) or (a)(9). Wood also cited \u00a7 523(a)(2) in her complaint, however, Wood has never argued this theory applied under these facts. The Court considers any claim by Wood under this Code section to have been abandoned by Wood. 8 . Assuming a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words, and to give additional context and flavor to this discussion, a photo of the subject truck, admitted in evidence in this action, is appended to this decision. 9 . In contrast, the Fifth Circuit has endorsed the use of an objective test. Miller v. J.D. Abrams Inc. (In re Miller), 156 F.3d 598, 603 (5th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>) 10 . Recall, Jury Instruction No. 16 provides: holding that there must be proof of both a willful act and malicious injury to establish nondischargeability under section 523a6holding that the debtors knowing act of failing to obtain workers compensation insurance so that the employer owed an employee a debt after the employee suffered a workplace injury was not the sort of willful and malicious injury required for nondischargeability under 523a6 because it cannot not be said that the employer intended for the employee to suffer a fall or that there was an unbroken chain of events leading from the employers intentional act to the employees physical injuryholding that either objective substantial certainty or subjective motive meets the supreme courts definition of willful injury in 523a6holding that 523a6 requires the actor to intend the injury not just the act that leads to the injuryholding that a mere deliberate or intentional act that causes injury is not sufficient to establish willfulness in the context of 11 usc 523a6 & \n\nagreement. Where, as here, the Offer Letter specifies benefits payable on discharge, the employee is entitled to those benefits if the termination amounts to a constructive discharge. See Robinson v. Kingston Hosp., 55 A.D.3d 1121, 1122, 866 N.Y.S.2d 387, 388 (3d Dep\u2019t 2008) (observing that, despite plaintiff\u2019s being at-will employee, change in employment terms would entitle her to contractual severance benefits if it amounted to constructive discharge). In rejecting Scott\u2019s claim of constructive discharge and accepting Harris\u2019s claim of resignation, the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that a salary in the reduced amount of $150,000 could not be deemed so abusive as to render continued employment untenable. See Pena v. Brat-tleboro Retreat, 702 F.2d 322, 325 (2d Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); accord Morris v. Schroder Capital Mgmt. holding that plaintiff alleging constructive discharge must prove deliberateness of the employers action and intolerability of the working conditionsrecognizing constructive discharge where employer rather than acting directly deliberately makes employees working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee would be forced into involuntary resignationrecognizing doctrine of constructive discharge under federal civil rights act and national labor relations act where employer knowingly permits working conditions to become so intolerable that a reasonable person subject to them would resignholding employee resigned and was not constructively discharged because there was no evidence that employer deliberately created working conditions that led to her resignationholding that defendant interfered with plaintiffs right when the employer forced her to choose between resignation and working without leave & \n\nthe employee was invited to an employer-sponsored dinner meeting. After attending the meeting, while on her way home, the employee was severely injured in an automobile accident. After accepting the Commission\u2019s finding that the employee had been required to attend the dinner, the court held the em ployee\u2019s journey was covered under the special mission exception: Here, claimant was attending an off-premises dinner meeting, after normal working hours, under at least the implied direction of her employer, and travel to and from the meeting was a necessity. These special circumstances justify the Commission\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s injuries while returning from the meeting were compensable. Id. at 916. See also Brown v.

Whether Thornburg \u201cact[s] under\u201d an officer of the United States such that removal under the federal officer removal statute is available to him Bell argues that this Court should remand her claim to state court because, based on this Court\u2019s decision in Cromelin, Thornburg cannot take advantage of the federal officer removal statute and remove the case under \u00a7 1442(a)(1). See Cromelin, 177 F.2d at 277 (<HOLDING>).

To be sure, several circuits have allowed the government to present evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to provide a handwriting exemplar as evidence of that defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt for the offense charged, as the government here requests. See, e.g., Askew, 584 F.2d at 963 (<HOLDING>). These decisions, however, are inapposite, as holding that while the government was required to prove that the defendants phone call crossed a state line the government did not need to prove that the defendant knew of the interstate nexusholding in a prosecution for the interstate transportation of forged securities that the government was permitted to prove and comment on a defendants refusal to produce exemplars as tending to prove his guilt of the offense chargedrecognizing the right of a defendant to comment upon the failure of the state to produce evidenceholding due process clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the charged offense and new york law that requires the defendant in a second degree murder prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter when no element of the charged offense is presumed does not violate the due process clauseholding that the government need not prove that interstate transport was foreseeable in order to obtain a conviction under 18 usc 2314 which prohibits the interstate transportation of stolen goods & \n\norganization differs from its for-profit cousins in its treatment of net earnings does not prevent its buildings or property from being used in interstate commerce or in an activity affecting interstate commerce.

Paragraph six of Dr. Katz\u2019s affidavit states, in pertinent part, that, when an anesthesiologist renders anesthesia services, whether on call or during the regular workday, \u201cit is our practice to charge for those services.\u201d The testimony in paragraph nine states that Dr. Riddle became responsible for S.D. when he assumed the care of Mrs. Chau. As such, he was entitled to compensation for intubat-ing S.D. after birth. While Dr. Katz purported to have personal knowledge of the facts recited in his affidavit, his statement regarding Dr. Riddle\u2019s entitlement to compensation is a legal conclusion with no supporting facts or rationale. See McIntyre, 109 S.W.3d at 749 (<HOLDING>). Dr. Katz\u2019s affidavit makes no claims that, holding there was no general jurisdiction when there was no evidence that defendants advertised or promoted their goods or services in texas solicited business in texas sold their goods or services to a texas entity established a general business office or general business presence in texas or targeted texas marketsholding that where patients expert witness did not testify to what degree of skill and learning ordinarily possessed by doctors in good standing in little rock or similar locales was patient failed to establish applicable standard of care thereby warranting directed verdict in favor of appellant doctorholding expert testimony is ordinarily required in legal malpractice cases to establish the standard of careholding that maryland doctor not qualified to testify about whats ordinarily billed or what the law ordinarily allows people to recover for their medical services in the state of texasholding that plaintiffs are ordinarily entitled to instructions consonant with their theory of the case where evidentiary support for the theory exists & \n\nthat when the government undertakes to perform services, which in the absence of specific legislation would not be required, it will, nevertheless, be liable if these activities are performed negligently.\u201d). In aviation cases, courts have held that an FAA controller owes a duty of reasonable care to an aircraft, passengers, crews, and cargoes in the performance of the controller\u2019s duties; these duties are concurrent with an airplane pilot\u2019s duty of due care. Davis v. United States, 824 F.2d 549, 550 (7th Cir.1987) (\u201cWhile general negligence law applies to airplane tort cases, ... the standard of due care is concurrent, resting upon both the airplane pilot and ground personnel.\u201d) (quoting Spaulding v.

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

Prior to Monessen, the United States Supreme Court had already decided that prejudgment interest is a form of \u201cactual damages\u201d and that damages are substantive. See id. Thus, no further analysis was needed to determine that prejudgment interest was substantive. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has found other state laws that have no relationship to damages to be substantive in FELA cases. See, e.g., Dice v. Akron, Canton & Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S. 359, 363, 72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398 (1952) (concluding that the right to have a jury decide factual issues of fraud is \u201ctoo substantial a part of the rights accorded by [FELA] to permit it to be classified as a mere local rule of procedure\u2019 \u201d); Brown, 338 U.S. at 299, 70 S.Ct. 105 (<HOLDING>); White, 238 U.S. at 511-12, 35 S.Ct. 865 holding that state courts must apply the federal pleading standard in fela casesholding that in diversity cases federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural lawholding that litigants may enforce fela in state courts as a matter of right but also observing that state courts are free to apply their own modes of procedure to fela casesrecognizing that the federal pleading standard is a less stringent standard than the delaware pleading standardholding that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity cases & \n\nstated: In many cases it would work the grossest injustice to a carrier if it could not rely on the contract of shipment it has made, know whether it was bound to obey the state or Federal law, or, obeying the former, find itself mulcted in penalties for not obeying the law of the other jurisdiction, simply because the shipper intended a transportation beyond that specified in the contract. It must be remembered that there is no presumption that a transportation when commenced is to be continued beyond the state limits, and the carrier ought to be able to depend upon the contract which it has made, and must conform to the liability imposed by that contract.

In short, the plaintiffs argue that they are \u201cconsumers\u201d of a \u201csale of services\u201d contract concerning the management, marketing, and breeding of Ready\u2019s Image as a stud, and that \u201cWalmac Farm marketed itself as the stud farm at which Ready\u2019s Image should be boarded and should stand stud.\u201d [Record No. 110, p. 25] The transactions at the heart of this dispute, however, do not involve simple purchases. An offer of services to manage the stud career of a thoroughbred race horse is certainly not something sold to the general public, but would be a service highly particularized and unique to the particular parties and stallion involved. See, e.g., Princeton Healthcare Sys., 422 N.J.Super. at 473-74, 29 A.3d 361 (<HOLDING>); BOC Grp. v. Lummus Crest, 251 N.J.Super. 271, holding that a contract for the installation and implementation of a complex computer system did not constitute a consumer purchase covered by the njcfa and noting that the contract did not provide for simply the installation of a standardized computer software program but rather the design of a custommade program to satisfy the plaintiffs unique needs and the defendants active participation in implementation of this programholding that a contract for the design manufacture and installation of two furnaces was predominantly a contract for the sale of goods and therefore subject to the uccs fouryear statute of limitationsholding that the implementation of a training program as opposed to the adoption of the program is not a discretionary function under the state tort liability actholding that a contract for the design construction and installation of a water tank was predominantly a contract for the sale of goods under the uccholding that the ucc applies to a computer software license with an additional obligation to provide incidental services where the predominant thrust of the contract was the sale and support of the software & \n\nthe \u201cuse\u201d of any trademark belonging to plaintiffs, as that term is used in the Lanham Act, because WhenU does not use any of the plaintiffs\u2019 trademarks to indicate anything about the source of the products and services it advertises.

The cases cited by plaintiffs (Plaintiffs\u2019 Reply Mem. pp. 1-2) do not support their argument that the inclusion of URLs in the WhenU directory constitutes the use of a trademark under the Lanham Act.

See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a) (\u201c... the trustee, with the court\u2019s approval, may employ ...\u201d); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b) (\u201cThe trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease ... \u201d); and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a) (\u201c... the trustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume or reject ... \u201d). As a consequence, courts have been left in these many instances to figure out for themselves what they are to consider. Their response, though, has frequently been limited to only the adoption of some vague standard that in turn is exemplified by some equally vague phrase. Take, for example, the different measures that courts have offered in connection with Section 363(b) sales. Section 363(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code governs the present dispute and provides (Bankr.D.Del.1987) (<HOLDING>); In re Charlesbank Laundry Co., 37 B.R. 20, 22 holding that the duty of good faith and fair dealing is a contractual dutyholding that duty of good faith and fair dealing did not extend to thirdparty claimantholding that benefiting fiduciary must show he acted in good faith and that transactions were fair and equitableholding that a sale must be both fair and reasonable in price and made in good faithholding that the transaction must be fair and equitable and in good faith & \n\nBaty further stated that Booth\u2019s representation to Baty was the reason that a warranty and representation to that effect was expressly included in the sale agreements. Howard & Howard communicated its representations via telephone calls and emails. Although the two paragraphs cobble together a few details, they fail to give even one date on which an alleged misrepresentation occurred. That alone dooms ABI\u2019s ability to allege fraud with particularity. See Heinrich, 668 F.3d at 393 (finding that a plaintiff failed to allege fraud with sufficient particularity because she \u201cd[id] not include [in her affidavit] the date she received the allegedly fraudulent email from the defendants.\u201d); see also United States ex rel.

Based on review of virtually all, if not all, reported opinions of federal courts dealing with the 1887 and 1911 versions, this Court has located no opinion where a court utilized it as applicable to any receiver or property manager other than one appointed by a federal court. See, e.g., Investment Registry v. Chicago & M. Elec. Ry. Co., 204 F. 500, 507 (E.D.Wis.1913); In re Kalb & Berger Mfg. Co., 165 F. 895, 896 (2d Cir.1908). With only one exception, this remained true after the statute was revised in 1948. See, e.g., SEC v. Lincoln Thrift Ass\u2019n, 557 F.2d 1274, 1277 n. 1 (9th Cir.1977); Republic Bank of Chicago v. Lighthouse Mgmt. Grp., Inc., 829 F.Supp.2d 766, 772 (D.Minn.2010) (<HOLDING>). This requirement arises not only from the holding that section 959a applies to receivers appointed by federal courts not state courtsholding that a federal courts dismissal of state claims without prejudice is not res judicata as to adjudication in either state or federal courtsholding that state courts in construing and interpreting state law are not bound by the decisions of federal courtsrecognizing that decisions of lower federal courts interpreting federal law are not binding on state courtsholding that district courts do not have appellate jurisdiction over state courts & \n\ncompeting motion for summary judgment. We overrule Faucette and Schadler\u2019s first issue. Damages for Breach of Option Contract In their second issue, Faucette and Schadler contend that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to prove damages for breach of contract. They argue that Grace was awarded what she would have received from the sale of the remaining shares of Sarco without any evidence of the value of the shares she should have surrendered in the transaction. According to Faucette and Schadler, proper proof of damages required not only evidence of the amount Grace would have received had the sale of the shares been performed, but also evidence of the value of the shares she would have surrendered in the transaction. See Miga v. Jensen, 96 S.W.3d 207, 215 (Tex.2002) (<HOLDING>); Holt Atherton Indus. Inc. v. Heine, 835 holding merely that to the extent a breaching party claims that the appropriate measure of damages is the difference between the contract price and the market price it holds the burden of proving that there is in fact an available market for the goods in issuerecognizing that breach of contract cause of action accrues at time of the breachholding that a cause of action for breach of contract accrues at the time of the breachholding that the measure of damages for the breach of a contract of sale where no fraud is shown is the difference between the contract price and the market price of the goods on the date of the breachholding damage award resulting from a breach of an agreement to purchase securities is the difference between the contract price and the fair market value of the asset at the time of the breach & \n\nthe alternative method of demonstrating scienter\u2014 motive \u2014 has not been established. Plaintiffs contend that the Andersen defendants were motivated to participate in the fraud because of personal gain. However, they have alleged no gain other than the fact that the Andersen firm was compensated for its professional services. It would defy common sense to hold that the motive element of the Beck scienter analysis would be satisfied merely by alleging the receipt of normal compensation for professional services rendered, because to do so would effectively abolish the requirement, as against professional defendants in a securities fraud action, of pleading facts which support a strong inference of scienter. Cf. Wilson v. Saintine Exploration and Drilling Corp., 872 F.2d 1124 (2d Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the Section 10(b) claim is holding that a professional owes no duty to third persons unless the professional had actual knowledge that those persons would rely on his rendering of professional servicesholding professional malpractice claim not contractualholding that ijnsurance policies are contracts and as such they are to be enforced according to their provisions and ijnsurance companies must be able to rely on their statements of coverage exclusions disclaimers definitions and other provisions in order to receive the benefit of their bargainholding that professional defendants who merely perform their usual professional functions and receive their normal compensation are not liable under the draconian provisions of section 122holding that 1 principal shareholder and chief executive officer of chapter 11 debtor in liquidation is not entitled to compensation beyond normal salary for performing duties required of the debtor 2 professional is a term which is not narrowly construed but applies to anyone the nature of whose services meet the criteria of a professional person 3 a professional license is not dispositive and 4 factors include form of compensation time of retention pre or postpetition and whether employment is full time or parttime & \n\nrole of the courts is to distinguish between biting criticism that merely suppresses demand and copyright infringement, which usurps it.\u201d) (internal quotations and citations omitted).

As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v. Woodard, 9 So.3d 112, 118 (La. 2009) holding court unable to rule on issue when the record fails to include copies of the evidence needed to decide issue on appealholding that an issue not raised on appeal is waivedholding issue not raised in the bankruptcy court was waived on appealholding that if the record discloses evidence needed to decide the issue of iac and that issue was raised by assignment of error on appeal it can be decided on appeal in the interest of judicial economyholding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it & \n\nprotections afforded to the debtors by the Bankruptcy Code and the automatic stay, specifically because the Adversary Proceeding will determine whether the debtors were in default and thus whether Bank of America is entitled to recover from the guarantors. This, the court believes, is precisely what the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception encompasses. 10 . Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\ngiven the defendant, a foreign state to be served under section 1608(a), was insufficient to meet the requirements of the FSIA. See also Shen v. Japan Airlines, 918 F.Supp. 686, 692 (S.D.N.Y.1994). The Seventh Circuit similarly required strict compliance under section 1608(a) in Alberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense De La Carne, 705 F.2d 250, 253 (7th Cir.1983). In that case, noting that section 1608(a) \u201cdelineates the \u2018exclusive procedures\u2019 for effecting service of process upon a foreign state,\u201d the court refused to excuse the plaintiffs service on the Nicaraguan Ambassador in lieu of the head of the foreign affairs ministry. See also Magnus Elec., Inc., v. Royal Bank of Canada, 620 F.Supp. 387, 389 (N.D.Ill.1985), aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 830 F.2d 1396 (7th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). The District of Columbia Circuit, holding holding that noncompliance with the fsiajs literal requirements though it certainly did provide notice deprives this court of personal jurisdictionholding that where it was erroneous for the district court to take judicial notice it certainly cannot be said that such notice was mandatory and therefore ire 201d is inapplicableholding that an effective notice of appeal must be filed for this court to have jurisdiction to hear the caseholding that at a bare minimum the district court was required to provide a pro se prisoner with fair notice of the summary judgment rule requirementsholding that late notice of the bond did not excuse supplier from its obligation to comply with statutory notice requirements & \n\nsentence ran concurrently to the federal sentence, and not vice versa. This analysis fails to take into account the effect of the Brazos County sentence, which the TDCJ re-commenced on November 28, 1998, before Mr. Thomas was sentenced in the federal case. After his federal sentence was imposed, he was returned to state custody, still serving a state sentence from Brazos County. Any time he served before being transferred to Burleson County custody was thus state time, not federal time. Also, although the federal sentence was imposed prior to his Burleson County sentence, under the applicable law his federal time did not actually begin to run until he was taken into federal custody, which only occurred on April 5, 2006. See Binford v. United States, 436 F.3d 1252, 1255 (10th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>); see also 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a). Finally, we holding that merely alluding to federal law does not raise a federal questionholding that a federal sentence does not commence until a prisoner is actually received into federal custody for that purposeholding that a determination of whether the defendants actions constituted a taking under the louisiana constitution does not implicate any issues of federal law and thus does not provides a basis for a federal district court to exercise federal subject matter jurisdictionholding that ncaa was not an indirect recipient of federal funds even though it received dues from schools that received federal fundsholding that just because a claim implicates a federal issue or involves construction of federal law does not necessarily give rise to a federal question and confer removal jurisdiction on a federal court & \n\nCo., 55 Ill. App. 3d 91, 98 (1977). Moreover, if the promisee bargains with the promisor to render a performance directly to a third party, in nearly every case the promisee will have intended to benefit that third party. Fox Lake, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 911. Here, Advanced clearly stands to benefit from the contract between McCormick and Berbee. Thus, this court must determine from the language of the contract and the circumstances surrounding the parties whether the benefit to Advanced is direct or incidental. Although the intent of the parties must be determined on a case-by-case basis, the cases cited by the parties to this appeal provide examples on both sides of this issue. Courts have held that the benefit was direct in the following cases: (1) Carson Pirie Scott, 346 Ill. at 261 (<HOLDING>); (2) Resnik, 78 Ill. 2d at 386-87 (determining holding prior to gonzaga that medicaid provision requiring nursing facilities to provide certain services was intended for the benefit of the recipients and not for the benefit of the facilitiesholding that the parties purchase agreement did not require a showing of prejudice for plaintiff to assert that defendant waived its claim for indemnificationholding that where purchaser had taken possession and paid part of the purchase price the statute of frauds did not bar enforcement of a purchase agreementholding that a creditors pmsi in goods sold to debtors did not survive consolidation of the original installment contract with a later contract for the purchase of additional goodsholding that an agreement to purchase certain goods from a named vendor and pay for them if the hotel company did not was for the direct benefit of the vendor & \n\nnot under Rule 21 but Rule 42(b) and effects merely a \u201cseparation of claims in an action in which multiple parties have been joined.\u201d) (emphasis omitted). The confusion that can arise from loose talk of \u201cseverance\u201d where in fact only a separation of claims has occurred, together with the impact the distinction can have on appellate jurisdiction, occasionally has provoked judicial frustration. See Spencer, White & Prentis, Inc. v. Pfizer, 498 F.2d 358, 359 (2 d Cir.1974) (speaking of the \u201ctangle of Rules 21, 42(b) [and] 54(b)\u201d). In the context of removal to federal court in diversity jurisdiction, the mere fact that an order of a state court purports to have \u201csevered\u201d claims generally is insufficient to make a case removable. See Nolan v. Boeing Co., 919 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v. Unijax, Inc., 625 F.2d 54, 56 holding that diversitydefeating parties were not severed from a case so as to permit removal to federal court where article 1038 of the louisiana code of civil procedure pursuant to which the severance was made authorizes separate trials rather than a true severanceholding the lumpsum payment of a severance benefit to be evidence of lack of an administrative schemeholding that a plan providing severance pay for reduction in work force simply did not contemplate the effect of a sale of a business on the availability of severance payholding that severance pay policy was part of employment contractholding that death qualification of jury is not of itself grounds for severance of a noncapital defendant & \n\nof his excessive force grieva rrectional officer shut off water for five days because the prisoner used the prison grievance system was sufficient to state a retaliation claim); Burgess, 39 F.3d at 218 (threat made in retaliation for a prisoner\u2019s use of the prison grievance system is sufficient to state a First Amendment retaliation claim). A reasonable jury could conclude that Blair\u2019s placement of Santiago in a cell without his personal property, proper facilities, bedding, or clothing and Blair\u2019s threat that things would get worse, issued after hearing Santiago complain that he was being retaliated against, are adverse actions sufficient to chill a prisoner of ordinary firmness from engaging in the prison grievance process. See Thaddeus-X v. Blatter, 175 F.3d 378, 398 (6th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). Santiago has also satisfied the causal holding that the prison physician lacked standing to raise the prisoners rights of access to the courtsholding that harassment physical threats and transfer to the area of the prison used to house mentally disturbed inmates especially combined with the conditions allegedly present there would likely deter a prisoner of ordinary firmness from exercising a right to access the courtsholding that the record contained insufficient evidence that increasing the prisoners work load would chill a prisoner of ordinary firmness from using the prison grievance processholding that although prison inmates have a first amendment right to access to the courts prison officials may regulate law library access including reasonable time place and manner of access taking into account the administrative needs of the institutionholding that threats to an inmates safety after his use of the prison grievance system supported a retaliation claim & \n\nremedies before suing the employer.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 236, 20 OBR 290, 485 N.E.2d 757, quoting Anderson v. Alpha Portland Industries, Inc. (C.A.8, 1984), 727 F.2d 177, 185. The Tenth District noted that retirees come within one of several exceptions to the general rule that employees must attempt to use contract-grievance procedures. The reasons for this exception include that the union does not owe a duty of fair representation to persons who ax*e not members of the collective-bargaining unit and the possibility of potential conflicts of interest between retirees and active employees. Id. {\u00b6 32} Rutledge has been followed in a number of subsequent decisions. See, e.g., Featherstone v. Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. (Mar. 30, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-889, 1999 WL 177561, *3 (<HOLDING>). The board contends that these cases are holding that trial court properly granted motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff had failed to exhaust remedies available through exclusive grievance procedureholding that a prisoner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he did not utilize grievance procedures that permitted waiver of the time limit for good causeholding that a retired teacher did not fail to exhaust administrative remedies because he was not subject to the grievance procedure in the collectivebargaining agreementholding that plaintiff could not look to the courts for relief because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies under the adeaholding that a plaintiff need not exhaust his administrative remedies to bring a retaliation claim & \n\nrestitution was set, the court was required to evaluate an inmate\u2019s individual ability to pay. See State v. Haines, 360 N.W.2d 791 (Iowa 1985) (noting that it is the \u201creasonable ability to pay\u201d standard which allows \u00a7 910.2 to pass constitutional muster). In addition, the plan of restitution and plan of payment were both subject to modification by the court. See Iowa Code \u00a7 910.7. Once this initial deprivation occurred, the inmates\u2019 interest in their money was diminished, much like the limitations on the freedom to spend money suffered by any person who incurs a debt. When the Department took the next step of designating specific procedures for the repayment of an inmate\u2019s restitution, the procedural requirements diminished. See, e.g., Scott v. Angelone, 771 F.Supp. 1064 (D.Nev.1991) (<HOLDING>). At this second stage of proceedings, the holding that defendants are estopped from raising nonexhaustion as an affirmative defense when prison officials inhibit an inmates ability to utilize grievance proceduresholding that an award for medical expenses is proper when the expenses have been incurred but not paidholding that notice and postdeprivation grievance procedures are sufficient process to freeze an inmates prison trust account until the prisoner pays for medical expenses he has incurredholding that threats to an inmates safety after his use of the prison grievance system supported a retaliation claimholding california postdeprivation recovery procedures satisfy due process despite lack of notice to claimant of recovery procedures & \n\nof Jotun\u2019s defense costs have not been recovered, Jotun may be reimbursed for the reasonable costs of defense paid by Jotun and not paid by Zurich. See Coleman, 418 F.3d at 525; Smith v. Reliance Ins. Co. of Ill., 807 So.2d 1010, 1022 (La.Ct.App.2002) (\u201c[The insurer] must underwrite reasonable costs incurred by the insured.\u201d). G. Jotun\u2019s Ability To Recover Attorney\u2019s Fees Incurred in the Instant Lawsuit With respect to Jotun\u2019s claims that it be reimbursed for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in this action, Liberty argues that Jotun cannot recover these fees pursuant to Louisiana law. Jotun claims that Louisiana Revised Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 22:658 and 22:1220 provide an award of attorney\u2019s fees as a result of its having to enforce Liberty\u2019s duty to defend. \u201c g, PA., 691 So.2d 715, 727 (La.Ct.App.1997) (<HOLDING>). Jotun has failed to allege in its holding that insurers failure to deny existence of insurance coverage under policy at issue was to admit that coverage existedholding that insured may recover attorneys fees from insurer where insurer acts in bad faithholding that if an insurer denies coverage based on an assertion that the underlying claim is excluded from coverage there is a presumption that the insurer did not suffer prejudice because prompt notice would have merely resulted in an earlier denial of coverageholding that when the insured brings an action for a declaration of coverage and prevails absent a bad faith denial of coverage by the insurer attorneys fees incurred by the insured in the prosecution of that action are not incurred at the request of the insurerholding that an insured could not recover attorneys fees pursuant to 22658 for litigating the coverage issue because the insurer did not act arbitrarily or capriciously and the insurers coverage defense was not frivolous & \n\nthe property damage occurred during a Liberty policy period. I. What Constitutes One Occurrence In Lombard v. Sewerage & Water Board of New Orleans, the Louisiana Supreme Court held that, in cases where different parties are damaged by a series of events, the damage to each party is a separate \u201coccurrence\u201d for purposes of an insurance c 1225-26 (La.Ct.App.1995) (\u201cThe differential settlement resulted from each home\u2019s continuous or repeated exposure to the injurious conditions over a course of time, but the effects of the excessive settlement did not become \u2018damage\u2019 until it was discovered by the homeowners.\u201d); see also, e.g., New Orleans Assets, L.L.C. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co., Nos. Civ.A. 01-2171, Civ.A. 02-974, 2002 WL 32121257, at *2-3 (E.D.La. Sept.12, 2002) (Feldman, J.)

See docket entries # 77 and # 78 (emphasis added). Under Gladson and Murphy, Plaintiff is not required to make such an allegation in order to state a valid free exercise claim. See Gladson, 551 F.3d at 831-32; Murphy, 372 F.3d at 988. Instead, as previously explained, he is only required to allege that Defendants prevented him from practicing a central tenet of his faith, which in this case, appears to be regularly reading his Bible. Furthermore, the Eighth Circuit has held, in several cases, that prisoners state viable free exercise claims when they allege that prison officials have limited their access to religious reading materials. See Roddy v. Banks, Case No. OS-3735, 2005 WL 433404 (8th Cir. Feb. 25, 2005) (unpublished opinion) (<HOLDING>); Williams v. Brimeyer, 116 F.3d 351, 354-55 holding a muslim prisoners free exercise claim failed because even though the prison did not provide him with halal meat he could comply with his religious requirements by simply eating a vegetarian meal and therefore the disputed policy did not force the prisoner to violate his religionholding that a prisoner stated a valid equal protection claim when he alleged he was denied a work assignment because of his sexual orientationrecognizing a religious institutions right to free exercise of religionholding that a prisoner stated a valid free exercise of religion claim where he alleged that prison officials refused to allow him to receive certain religious booksholding that religious exercise is any exercise of religion whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief and that the use building or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered religious exercise & \n\nthe product as promised minus the value of the product delivered.\u201d). Thus, the proper question is not how much the erroneous sticker may have reduced the vehicle\u2019s perceived value for any individual purchaser or lessee. Rather, damages should reflect the difference between the market value of a 2014 Cadillac CTS with perfect safety ratings for three standardized categories and the market value of a 2014 Cadillac CTS with no safety ratings. Unlike the calculation of an individual consumer\u2019s direct pecuniary loss, which would limit the plaintiff to the difference of what she paid and the actual value received, the FDUTPA \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d model provides a standardized class-wide damages figure because the plaintiffs out-of-pocket payment is immaterial. See Coghlan, 240 F.3d at 453 (<HOLDING>); 13 A.L.R.3d 875, \u00a7\u00a7 3(a) and 4(a) holding that in cases of a false conflict of law a court may apply the law of the forum staterecognizing that fdutpa cases apply a benefit of the bargain damages formularecognizing that berry altered the apportionment and valuation portions of the taggart formulaholding that banks damages were benefit of the bargain type damages that fail to constitute a substantial and independent injury sufficient to remove borrowers claim from the operation of the statute of fraudsholding that competitor could seek only injunction under fdutpa not damages & \n\na sum for abandoning his interest in the 2007 Mortgage so that Wells Fargo could go into state court to seek its reformation. Or, once the mortgage is avoided and preserved for the benefit of the estate, the Trustee might himself seek its reformation in state court. But what the Trustee cannot do in a Chapter 7 case is use the Bankruptcy Code to change the terms of an avoidable mortgage. Reformation of the 2007 Mortgage is reserved to the parties to that mortgage and\/or the state court. For these reasons, approval of the Compromise in the form offered is not possible. Nor can the Court fashion its own remedy for liquidating the estate\u2019s interest in the 2007 Mortgage in lieu of the Trustee\u2019s judgment. See In re Central Illinois Energy, L.L.C., 406 B.R. 371 (Bankr.C.D.Ill. 2008) (<HOLDING>). C.

In all \u201cspecial needs\u201d cases, the nature of the need addressed makes particularized suspicion impossible or otherwise renders the warrant requirement impractical. For example, in Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 876, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987), the Court noted that requiring a warrant before a search of a probationer\u2019s home would \u201cinterfere to an appreciable degree with the probation system,\u201d and would \u201creduce the deterrent effect that the possibility of expeditious searches would otherwise create.\u201d Similarly, the Burger Court noted that \u201csurprise is crucial if the regulatory scheme aimed at remedying this major social problem is to function at all.\u201d 482 U.S. at 710, 107 S.Ct. 2636; see also Skinner, 489 U.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (<HOLDING>).

Id. at 532. Our Supreme Court held \u201cthat when changing a group policy insuring contributing employees and obtaining the applications of those employees, the employer acts as an agent of the employees [cits.], and as such is under a duty to notify the employees of differences between the old and new policies and of any rights the employees may have to continue the old insurance on an individual basis. We hold further that where this duty is breached, an employee can recover such damages as result from the difference in coverage.\u201d Id. at 535-536. Although this case is somewhat factually different from Dawes Mining, the same analysis of duty and breach are applicable in this case. When an employee makes application for group health insurance coverage and ) (1981) (<HOLDING>).

See Armendariz v. Penman, 75 F.3d 1311, 1320 (9th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Summary judgment was proper on McKinney\u2019s First Amendment claim because McKinney failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officers acted with intent to deny McKinney his first amendment rights. Cf. Sloman v. Tadlock, 21 F.3d 1462, 1469 (9th Cir.1994). Summary judgment on McKinney\u2019s claim alleging the seized property was never returned to him was proper because McKinney admitted at deposition that he did not follow California state law procedures for recovering property pursuant to Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1536. See City of West Covina v. Perkins, 525 U.S. 234, 241, 119 S.Ct. 678, 142 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (<HOLDING>).

While the Court of Criminal Appeals refers to all three of these rules in its peitinent order, we focus our analysis on Rule 32.6(b), as Frazier\u2019s failure to provide \"full disclosure of the factual basis\u201d of the relevant claim was the sine qua non of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s dismissal. 7 . It is uncontroversial that \"[i]f the petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies that are no longer available, that failure is a procedural default which will bar federal habeas relief, unless either the cause and prejudice or the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is established.\u201d Smith v. Jones, 256 F.3d 1135, 1138 (11th Cir.2001); see also Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep't of Corr., 568 F.3d 894, 908 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>).

In Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh, 864 F.2d 804, 808-10 (D.C.Cir.1988) (en banc), this court had held that a federal prisoner seeking to challenge his parole eligibility date was required to proceed in habeas, even though success upon his claims would not necessarily result in his earlier release. Later, however, in Anyanwutaku v. Moore, 151 F.3d 1053, 1055-57 (D.C.Cir. 1998), we permitted a District of Columbia prisoner to challenge his parole eligibility date in a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In the latter case, we relied primarily upon two Supreme Court cases, Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (<HOLDING>), and Heck v.

Justice Hutchinson suggests that prior felony convictions must be factually similar to the conviction at issue in order to support the aggravating circumstance. Id. This interpretation of the aggravating circumstance by Justice Hutchinson, accepted by only one other Justice, is not binding precedent upon this court. See CRY, Inc. v. Mill Service, Inc., 536 Pa. 462, 640 A.2d 372, 376 n. 3 (1994). Additionally, we specifically rejected reliance upon Holcomb for the argument raised by Appellant in Commonwealth v.

See Hunn, 24 F.3d at 999-1000 (Easterbrook, J., dissenting); United States v. Cadotte, 57 F.3d 661, 662 (8th Cir.1995)(per curiam) (Arnold, J., dissenting), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 783, 133 L.Ed.2d 733 (1996). In United States v. Tuck, 964 F.2d 1079 (11th Cir.1992), the Eleventh Circuit observed that \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F) predicates the application of the enhancement on two factors. First, the threat must be express 1th Cir.1993)(per curiam)(<HOLDING>). Similarly, Judge Easterbrook, dissenting in holding that an enhancement for an express threat of death may not be applied to the sentence for robbery when the threat is related to the use of the firearm and the defendant has a 924c sentence for the same firearmholding that the phrase i have a gun constitutes a threat of death under 2b31b2fholding that threat i have a gun and nothing to lose was not an express threat of death because there was not express mention of death and could also be interpreted to mean that robber was desperate and willing to turn alleged gun on himselfholding that the statement i have a gun is a threat of deathholding that i have a gun give me money may imply threat to use gun but was not an express threat of death & \n\ntrial court to hold an evidentiary hearing to make a factual determination as to whether Richardson\u2019s failure to appear at his sentencing was willful. At this hearing, the State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Richardson willfully failed to appear. See Peacock v. State, 77 So.3d 1285, 1288 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citing Ingmire, 9 So.3d at 1281). If the State fails to establish willfulness, then Richardson should be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement previously accepted by the trial court. See Lowery v. State, 22 So.3d 745, 749 (Fla. 2d DCA 2009). REVERSED and REMANDED. TORPY, PALMER and LAMBERT, JJ., concur. 1 . Richardson\u2019s plea agreement is known as a \"Quarterman\u201d agreement.

The court granted defendant's motion. Despite the ruling, the State's attorney asked a question about the circumstances of his leaving the Marines and he replied, \"I deserted.\" State v. Smith, supra at 427. Defendant did not object to the question, did not move to instruct the jury to disregard the answer, and did not move to strike the answer. The Supreme Court held that defendant's motion to exclude the evidence was sufficient to preserve the error for appeal, concluded the error was prejudicial and ordered a new trial. As Smith demonstrates, a ruling on a motion to exclude evidence is not necessarily merely advisory and tentative. Accord, State v. Brooks, 20 Wn. App. 52, 59-60, 579 P.2d 961 (1978) (<HOLDING>) (citing State v. Smith, supra). If such a holding that although a defendant filed a motion in limine on an evidentiary issue a failure to object to the evidence at trial waives the issue for appealholding that a defendants failure to object or join in a codefendants objection to an issue bars the defendant from raising the issue on appealholding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that failure to object does not preclude raising the issue on appeal where erroneous evidence is offered in violation of an order in limine & \n\nexisting driveways and curb cuts in light of the statutory change that has affected the plaintiff\u2019s ability to use his deeded easement. This conduct is the functional equivalent of the obstruction or impairment contemplated in Sakansky and Bean. The trial court also found that the deviation proposed by the plaintiff would not unduly burden the defendant. We uphold such findings if they are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. See Batakis v. Town of Belmont, 135 N.H. 595, 597, 607 A.2d 956, 957 (1992). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Under these circumstances, the owner of the dominant estate may deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. Cf. Haley v. Colcord, 59 N.H. 7, 9 (1879) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling holding that an easement is not a separate estate when dominant and servient tracts are under the same ownershipholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estateholding that the burden on the servient estate cannot be increased without the consent of the owners of the servient estate and that the owner of the dominant estate to which the appurtenant easement is attached has no power to convey or expand use of that easement in connection with a tract of land owned by anotherrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that dominant tenant may deviate from path of prescriptive easement to extent reasonably necessary to pass around obstruction created by servient tenant & \n\ncreating anger or resentment and a cross burning done with the [constitutionally proscribable] purpose of threatening or intimidating a victim\u201d), 374 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing that the First Amendment prohibits the conviction of a person for cross burning without the intent to intimidate, but concluding that the number of such convictions likely to occur under the Virginia statute was too small to render the statute facially overbroad). 20 Pet. for Review, State v.

Two caveats must accompany the League court\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute\u2019s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 351-52, 109 S.Ct. 1835, 104 L.Ed.2d 351 (1989) (<HOLDING>). Under the Compact, an EIS needs to include holding that an eis must consider the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided by discussing possible mitigation measuresrecognizing that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense a party must plead and proveholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleadedholding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by a true inconsistencyholding that perfunctory description of mitigation measures was inadequate & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); see also State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 430, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, this Court has held that [\u0430] holding that juveniles request for parent is invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that a suspects invocation of the right to remain silent must be unequivocal to require that police questioning ceaserecognizing two aspects to assertion of fifth amendment rights 1 a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand request was made for an attorney and 2 the request was for assistance with a custodial interrogation not for subsequent hearings or proceedingsholding a juveniles request to speak to a probation officer is not a per se invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that an unequivocal invocation of the fifth amendment right to counsel must be presented in a manner that a reasonable police officer under similar circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for the presence of an attorney & \n\nentities like GasPlus. See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The causation requirement is satisfied holding a deviation from the terms of a contract constitutes an impairment of contractholding that even though an executive order mandating agency consideration of environmental justice concerns created no private right of action for an agencys failure to comply with that mandate the court would review the agencys action as an exercise of discretion under the apa and nepaholding that the evidence must be sufficient to support the agencys findings of fact and that the agencys inferences from those facts must be reasonableholding that an agencys interference with a private partys contract rights constitutes an injury in factholding that potential loss of a contract constitutes irreparable injury & \n\naward, do not justify overturning that award. Instead, only \u201cutterly irrational\u201d legal conclusions will be cognizable; \u201c[i]n these circumstances the appropriate standard of review is whether the construction of the contract presents such an egregious mistake that it amounts to an arbitrary remaking of the contract between the parties.\u201d 277 Cal.Rptr. at 714. Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v. Mid States Port Auth., 242 Kan. 683, 751 P.2d 122, 127 (1988) (<HOLDING>); Runewicz v. Keystone Ins. Co., 476 Pa. 456, holding that an award of arbitration cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or the facts if the award is within the scope of the submission and the arbitrators are not guilty of the acts of misconduct set forth in the statute the award operates as a final and conclusive judgment and however disappointing it may be the parties must abide by itholding that manifest disregard of the law is one of the very unusual circumstances in which a federal court can set aside an arbitration awardholding that errors of law without accompanying fraud or misconduct not enough to set aside arbitration awardholding that the trial court was without authority to set aside entry of default on motion to set aside default judgmentrecognizing that a trial court can set aside verdict & \n\nyears to life for a first conviction and a penalty of 20 years to life for a second or subsequent conviction\u201d; subsection (b) sets forth what \u201ccould properly [be] characterized as an \u2018aggravated\u2019 continuing criminal enterprise,\u201d carrying a mandatory life term, and requiring additional \u201celements\u201d to be proven. Montalvo argues that his \u201cillegal mandatory life sentence must be corrected to a term authorized by the facts reflected in the basic verdict for a continuing criminal enterprise.\u201d It appears that Montalvo argues that he was convicted of a \u201cbasic\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(a), but sentenced for an \u201caggravated\u201d continuing criminal enterprise pursuant to section 848(b). So construed, this argument is cognizable under Rule 35(a). Fowler, 794 F.2d at 1449 (<HOLDING>). However, Montalvo\u2019s challenge fails on the holding that rule 35a can be used to challenge sentences that are not authorized by the judgment of convictionholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding that affidavits that are conclusory and based on hearsay can not be used to oppose motion for summary judgmentrecognizing that the phrases can be used interchangeablyholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him & \n\nthe court should not have imposed an offense level of 34. He also contends that the breaking and entering charge cannot be used as the predicate violent crime because there is an insufficient \u201cnexus\u201d between the firearm and the alleged state offense. Making a determination under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ \u201ca formal categorical approach\u201d irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>).

Raines, 769 F.2d 1341, 1344 (9th Cir.1985) (same). Valdez next argues that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the district court\u2019s sentence enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (firearm possession) and 3B1.1 (leader\/organizer). However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v. Willard, 919 F.2d 606, 609 (9th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, Valdez\u2019s sentence enhancement holding that the court cannot examine the underlying merits of the claims in determining whether to certify a classholding that a trial court has a duty to examine the entire record including all physical documentary evidence in order to reach an equitable resultholding that the trial court must examine the entire course of criminal conduct in determining possessionholding that for purposes of determining whether complete diversity exists a court must examine the plaintiffs pleading as of the time of the petition for removaiholding that court must examine and consider the entire writing in an effort to harmonize and give effect to all the provisions of the contract so that none will be rendered meaningless & \n\nthe Supreme Court limited in Finley. In Finley, the plaintiff was attempting to bring non-federal defendants into a federal action based on a statute which is explicitly written to allow jurisdiction over only federal defendants. In the case at bar, a defendant is attempting to join a third- party defendant under the impleader rule which explicitly allows such an inclusion. The justice of the impleader rule is that it allows a defendant, who is itself in federal court against its will, to bring in parties who in fact may be more responsible to the plaintiff.

Here, the Service Agreement, unlike the APA and Employment Agreements, does not contain a broad arbitration clause in its \u201cRemedies\u201d section; rather, the Service Agreement contemplates arbitration only of disputes regarding the narrow issue of a new compensation arrangement in the event of certain regulatory changes. If the parties intended to arbitrate all disputes arising out of the Service Agreement, they could have easily included the same broad arbitration provision in that agreement. See Alticor, Inc. v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 411 F.3d 669, 672 (6th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>).

Thus, in the absence of an injury and with no \u201creal and substantial\u201d dispute, the court properly declined to entertain Count I upon removal. In its Dismissal Opinion, the district court compared this proceeding to the situation in Bowen v. First Family Financial Services, Inc., 233 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir.2000). In Bowen, the class action plaintiffs lacked standing to question whether arbitration agreements are generally unenforceable under the Truth-in-Lending Act. The Eleventh Circuit so ruled because \u201cthere [was] no allegation that First Family has invoked, or threatened to invoke, the arbitration agreement to compel the plaintiffs to submit any claim to arbitration.\u201d Id. at 1339. This action is similar to Bo 02, 704 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (<HOLDING>). Notably, some courts have premised such holding that a dispute arising out of an insurance policy was not covered by the arbitration provision in the parties separate premium payment agreement because if the party had intended to subject this dispute to the arbitration provision it could easily clearly and unequivocally have done so either by including an arbitration provision in the insurance policy itself or by adding to the above arbitration provisionrecognizing as nonjusticiable challenge to arbitration provision absent sufficient indications that it would be invokedholding that an arbitration provision that waived class actions and thus required the consumer to pay a 125 fee to vindicate a 150 claim was substantively unconscionable but also holding that the waiver provision was severable from the remainder of the arbitration provision which would be enforcedholding that the trial court not the arbitrator must decide a challenge to an arbitration provision based on public policyholding that 4 does not empower court to rewrite venue provisions of arbitration clause or to order arbitration within district absent contractual provision so indicating & \n\nso, the Court noted Congress\u2019s recognition of this principle in enacting the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The earlier cases cited in Todd Shipyards included Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U.S. 578, 17 S.Ct. 427, 41 L.Ed. 832 (1897), St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v.

Nov. 3, 2005) (rejecting policy argument). For example, Albany Insurance Co. v. Bengal Marine, Inc. involved a policy requiring the insured to pay a certain deductible before the insurer became liable; the Fifth Circuit, applying Louisiana law, held that, in light of Louisiana\u2019s direct action statute, the insurer was liable for claims above the deductible up to the policy limit when the insured could not pay the deductible due to insolvency. 857 F.2d 250, 255-56 (5th Cir.1988). Other courts have reached a similar result by holding that enforcing retained limit or deductible provisions in this situation would defeat state bankruptcy provision laws. See, e.g., Home Ins.

Thus, the discrimination provision of the Act is not vague. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the harassment provision of the Act, \u00a7 709.338(6), is vague because the Act does not define \u201cunnecessarily harassing.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that patients may hold diverse views as to what constitutes unnecessary harassment. Plaintiffs argue that what conduct is prohibited thus depends on what a particular patient understands it to be, and that the resulting uncertainty as to what the Act prohibits \u201cis not permissible under the First Amendment.\u201d See Conant, 309 F.3d at 639 (<HOLDING>) (citing Collins, 323 U.S. at 535, 65 S.Ct. at holding that where the first amendment does not protect a certain activity there can be no first amendment right of association to engage in that activityholding a statute providing for administrative action against physicians who engage in speech that the patient believes to be a recommendation of marijuana lacks the requisite narrow specificity under the first amendmentholding statute criminalizing speech intended to influence a juror did not violate the first amendmentholding that first amendment protections apply to compelled speech as well as restrictions on speechholding that possession of marijuana is not protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment & \n\nfor the \u201cprevailing competitive price\u201d for glass repair based upon \u201cprices charged by a substantial number of repair facilities in the area * \u215c * as determined by a survey.\u201d Because Glass Service\u2019s prices typically exceed what State Farm has determined by a survey to be the prevailing competitive price, State Farm is not obligated under the policy to pay the excess.

See Minn.Stat. \u00a7 72A.201, subd. 4(5) (making it an unfair claims practice to fail to notify an insured of all available benefits which the insured may be eligible to receive); see also DeBonaventura v.

For the same reasons discussed above with respect to Ms. Jaramillo\u2019s equal protection claim, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that the accommodations provided by the State were unreasonable. Ms. Jaramillo had been quite successful in the past with identical accommodations, and several courts have made clear that the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act require only reasonable accommodations, not necessarily the particular accommodations an individual would prefer.

Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d holding that insurance policy that discriminated against the disabled did not violate the ada but did independently violate the unruh actholding that when an employer takes steps to accommodate an employees restrictions it is not thereby conceding that the employee is disabled under the ada or that it regards the employee as disabledholding that the ada does not require an employer to hire an assistant to help a disabled employee fulfill his work responsibilitiesholding that the ada requires fastfood restaurants to implement policies or procedures to effectively train their employees how to deal with disabled individuals but does not require a particular policy or procedureholding that an entity that serves the disabled lacks standing under the ada & \n\nUnited States\u201d of Fla.

Stat. \u00a7 95.11(1), which reads: \u201cof a court of record in this state.\u201d Additionally, Kiesel applied (and the Balfour court relied on) the principle of statutory interpretation; which dictates that the latter portions of a statute, if in conflict with earlier portions, shall control. In interpreting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11, the Kiesel (state) and Balfour (federal) courts found that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(2)(a) controls post-judgment collection proceedings. It is important to note, however, that the holding in Balfour was expressly limited to the facts of that case, which involved a \u201cpost-judgment discovery request,\u201d six years after the initial default judgment was entered.

Radnor Twp. Sch. Dist., 202 F.3d 642, 654 (3d Cir.2000). No such proceeding concerning E.M.\u2019s education has been initiated. Although the Majority devotes pages to discussing whether this case is a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 1415, the proper inquiry is whether there exists a separate pending \u00a7 1415 proceeding, such as a due process complaint or an appeal of a ruling on such a complaint. Because \u201cstay put\u201d operates only \u201cMuring the pendency\u201d of such a proceeding, and no such proceeding has been initiated, \u00a7 1415\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d provision simply does not apply. See Moss by Mutakabbir v. Smith, 794 F.Supp. 11, 14 (D.D.C.1992) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, as the Majority acknowledges, there holding that the stay put provision establishes a strong preference but not a statutory duty for maintenance of the status quoholding that a federal action to enforce the stay put provision is not itself a pending proceeding under 1415 that triggers stay putholding that insurance guarantee association stay statute did not suspend limitation period because action was not pending when stay was enteredholding that the automatic stay did not bar the filing of a proof of claim where the debtor actively litigated a separate action during the pending bankruptcy proceeding because to permit the automatic stay provision to be used as a trump card played after an unfavorable result was reached would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the automatic stayholding that use of the preliminary injunction equitable factors would dilute the statutory framework under the stay put provision & \n\nInc., 752 F.Supp.2d 246 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (determining that, \u201calthough the relative means of [individual] plaintiffs in contrast to a national company clearly favors plaintiffs,\u201d plaintiff failed to demonstrate that travel to the transferee forum would pose a significant burden relative to traveling to the transferor forum). Here, plaintiff is opposing transfer to his home forum and arguing that his means prohibit him from prosecuting his lawsuit there because his attorney would need to travel from New York to New Jersey (or he would need to find another attorney, which he has not been able to do thus far). The Court finds that the additional burden that would be imposed on counsel to travel to the District of New Jersey carries SI), 2002 WL 523568, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2002) (<HOLDING>).

We agree with the district court that \u00a7 83-11-109 has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\u2019s risk and therefore the first Pireno factor weighs in favor of concluding \u00a7 83-11-109 regulates the business of insurance. American Bankers also argues that \u00a7 83-11-109 is not an integral part of the insurer-insured relationship and thus fails to meet the second Pireno factor. On the contrary, \u00a7 83-11-109 is an integral part of the insurer-insured relationship because it controls how disputes regarding uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage will be resolved. See West, 267 F.3d at 823 (<HOLDING>); accord McKnight, 358 F.3d at 858; Mut. holding that a missouri state law excepting insurance contracts from an arbitration law regulated the business of insurance because it applied to the processing of disputed claims and had a substantial effect on the insureiinsured relationshipholding that under georgia law a holder of a master insurance policy is an agent of the insurance company and not the insurerholding that the mccarranferguson act which bars application of a federal law in the face of a state law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance did not preclude the concurrent assertion of the federal rico statute and nevada insurance lawholding that erisa preempted state law claim brought by employer against insurance company for wrongful claims processingrecognizing that the duty arises not from the terms of the insurance contract but from an obligation imposed in law as a result of the special relationship & \n\n"}

However, such suits must be filed within two years of the decision by the IRS refusing the claim for refund.

This attribute alone disqualifies WCTF\u2019s claim under \u00a7 65(8) from classification as a tax. B. The Principle of Equal Distribution. There is another reason, however, for treating claims under \u00a7 65(8) as non-tax claims. As noted above, Feiring teaches that the policies of the Bankruptcy Code establish the criteria upon which priority status of a claim is to be determined. 313 U.S. at 285, 61 S.Ct. 1028. Giving tax priority to WCTF\u2019s reimbursement claim here would enervate the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s central policy of equal distribution among similar creditors. See Lorber, 675 F.2d at 1067-68; New Neighborhoods, 886 F.2d at 718-19 (noting the need to limit priority claims in bankruptcy); Suburban II, 36 F.3d at 487 (<HOLDING>) (citing Begier v.

Vivian, 601 N.W.2d at 874. The legislative history of the sex discrimination provision of Title VII is not substantial. Nevertheless, the federal courts which have examined Title VII\u2019s legislative history have found personal grooming codes that reflect customary modes of grooming having only an insignificant impact on employment opportunities do not constitute sex discrimination within the meaning of the Act. See, e.g., Barker v. Taft Broadcasting Co., 549 F.2d 400, 401-02 (6th Cir.1977); Knott, 527 F.2d at 1252; Dodge, 488 F.2d at 1337. Several federal appellate courts have considered Title VII in the context of personal grooming codes regulating hair length. Every federal appellate court w . 593, 795 P.2d 602, 604 (1990) (<HOLDING>). Because there was no discrimination on the holding that the court may only make a facial inquiry into the validity of the certificationrecognizing that source code is speech but not reaching the object code issueholding that the apparent conflict between two subsections of the tax code renders the facial meaning of the statute ambiguousholding personal grooming code which allows females to wear jewelry but prohibits men from wearing facial jewelry was not sexually discriminatory under state statuteholding that since limitations section in internal revenue code allows for suits against a sovereign its requirements are jurisdictional & \n\nentities like GasPlus. See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The causation requirement is satisfied holding a deviation from the terms of a contract constitutes an impairment of contractholding that even though an executive order mandating agency consideration of environmental justice concerns created no private right of action for an agencys failure to comply with that mandate the court would review the agencys action as an exercise of discretion under the apa and nepaholding that the evidence must be sufficient to support the agencys findings of fact and that the agencys inferences from those facts must be reasonableholding that an agencys interference with a private partys contract rights constitutes an injury in factholding that potential loss of a contract constitutes irreparable injury & \n\ndid have a prepetition legal interest in that case. At the time of bankruptcy, \u00a7 172 of the Internal Revenue Code gave the debtor a claim for a tax refund if certain conditions were met. It was the combination of the law and the conditions made legally relevant by the law that conferred on the debtor a prepetition legal interest: the claim for a refund. In that way, the Segal debtors\u2019 claim for a refund is similar to the prepetition accrual of a cause of action that results in a post-petition judgment in the debtor\u2019s favor. In such eases, the debtor\u2019s cause of action is a prepetition legal interest \u2014 \u25a0\u00a7 541(a)(1) property- \u2014 -that brings the postpetition judgment into the estate as proceeds under \u00a7 541(a)(6). See, e.g., Wieburg v. GTE Southwest Inc., 272 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Here, by contrast, Burgess suffered the crop holding that claims harming the debtor corporation that arose from prepetition conduct become property of the estate under 11 usc 541a1holding that causes of action for age and sex discrimination that arose prepetition were property of the bankruptcy estateholding that to make out the fourth element of a prima facie case of sex discrimination plaintiff must prove that males remained in similar positions and similarly for age discrimination that she was otherwise discharged because of her ageholding lost future wages recovered pursuant to a prepetition cause of action are property of the estateholding age discrimination claim barred & \n\nreferrals to specialists\u2014 the discrimination provision is sufficiently clear in apprising physicians that they may not provide firearm-owning patients with less medical care than they would other patients, in any circumstances. Thus, the discrimination provision of the Act is not vague. Finally, Plaintiffs argue that the harassment provision of the Act, \u00a7 709.338(6), is vague because the Act does not define \u201cunnecessarily harassing.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that patients may hold diverse views as to what constitutes unnecessary harassment. Plaintiffs argue that what conduct is prohibited thus depends on what a particular patient understands it to be, and that the resulting uncertainty as to what the Act prohibits \u201cis not permissible under the First Amendment.\u201d See Conant, 309 F.3d at 639 (<HOLDING>) (citing Collins, 323 U.S. at 535, 65 S.Ct. at holding that where the first amendment does not protect a certain activity there can be no first amendment right of association to engage in that activityholding a statute providing for administrative action against physicians who engage in speech that the patient believes to be a recommendation of marijuana lacks the requisite narrow specificity under the first amendmentholding statute criminalizing speech intended to influence a juror did not violate the first amendmentholding that first amendment protections apply to compelled speech as well as restrictions on speechholding that possession of marijuana is not protected by the free exercise clause of the first amendment & \n\nof the Court may be viewed as the position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\" Marks v.

The narrowest ground for the court's disposition in Williams is that of the lead opinion and Justice Thomas: the subject report was not testimonial. But, as the Arizona Supreme Court recently explained, the plurality's 'primary purpose' test nor Justice Thomas's solemnity standard can be deemed a subset of the other; therefore, there is no binding rule for determining when reports are testimonial.\" State v.

Dep\u2019t of Treasury, State of Mich., Revenue Div., 987 F.2d 376, 381 (6th Cir.1993).

Citing Foti, Zortman argues that because JCC\u2019s message indicated it was \u201cimportant\u201d that constitutes communicating information regarding a debt. Foti, 424 F.Supp.2d at 656 (noting that the message stated it that the \u201cmatter required immediate attention\u201d in concluding that the voicemail was a communication). JCC, for its part in the supplemental briefing, argued that its messages did not violate \u00a7 1692c(b) because they did not disclose that a particular consumer actually owed a debt. JCC points the Court to several cases, though not precisely on point, that indicate that a mere statement identifying a caller as a debt collector may not be sufficient to convey information regarding a debt. See Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 668 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>); Zamos II v.

Two caveats must accompany the League court\u2019s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute\u2019s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v.

Section 541(a)(7) makes property of the estate any interest in properly that the estate (not the debtor) acquires after the case. Here, the bankruptcy court found that the bonus constituted earnings from personal services of Mr. Markosian under \u00a7 1115(a)(2) and that ruling was not appealed. Thus, the earnings fall within the earnings exception stated in \u00a7 541(a)(6). We note however that there may be chapter 11 cases which are converted to chapter 7 where it is necessary to separate earnings from personal services by an individual from the earnings of a business. See FitzSimmons v. Walsh (In re FitzSimmons), 725 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir.1984) holding noncompete payments were not exempt from the debt ors bankruptcy estate as earnings from postpetition services under 541a6 because the noncompete agreement was inextricably intertwined with the debtors sale of stock that was an includable bankruptcy asset that predated debtors bankruptcy petitionholding that where the debtor is the owner of a policy insuring his own life and listing his wife as the beneficiary upon his death the proceeds of the policy including the cash value thereof are exempt from the claims of the insureds creditorsholding that proceeds of a personal injury settlement are not exempt under missouri lawholding that where subchapter s corporations revenue was generated from professional accounting services of its sole shareholder or from personal services performed under him funds generated by the business which shareholder withdrew to pay personal expenses although not denominated wages for purposes of bookkeeping could be considered wages for purposes of calculating preinjury wageholding that only the debtors earnings from his own personal services were exempt under 541a6 as opposed to all profits generated by his law practice & \n\nas an \u201cagent\u201d of WMATA, is an \u201cemployer\u201d hable under section 2000e-2(a)(l) for discriminating against her on the basis of her sex. While a construction of the statute to impose individual liability on an agent is facially plausible, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of this agent provision was to incorporate respondeat superior liability into the statute.\u201d Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s Int'l Inc., 991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir.1993) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while a supervisory employee may be joined as a party defendant in a Title VII action, that employee must be viewed as being sued in his capacity as the agent of the employer, who is alone hable for a violation of Title VII. See Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). Considering the evidence in the hght most holding individual defendants are not an employer within meaning of title viiholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that there is no individual liability under title viiholding that individual employees are not liable under title viiholding individual employees may be liable under title vii & \n\nclear and convincing evidence of the settlor's intent. Id. \u00a7 75-1-605(8). 136 This section of the UUTC directly conflicts with the holding of Banks. Under Banks, the settlor's intent at the time of creation of the trust was paramount because the settlor has created the trust he is no longer the owner of the trust property and has only such ability to deal with it as is expressly reserved to him in the trust instrument.\" Banks, 2002 UT 65, \u00b6 9, 52 P.3d 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in Banks we noted that \"a settlor has the power to modify or revoke a trust only if and to the extent that such power is explicitly reserved by the terms of the trust.\" Id. Under this framework, a settlor may revoke or amend the trust only by strictly complying with its terms. See id. 112 (<HOLDING>). In contrast, the UUTC does not require strict holding that beneficiaries could not sue attorneys of the trust for legal malpractice because beneficiaries are not direct recipients of the attorneys servicesholding that nonsignatory settlor and trust beneficiaries could be compelled to arbitrate under account agreement between trustee and merrill lynch which contained an arbitration clause because agreement was the underlying basis for all the claims of the beneficiaries and there would have been no claims without the agreementholding that the settlor could divest the beneficiaries of their vested interests only by completely revoking the trust because she had limited her ability to eliminate the beneficiaries interests by including language in the trust stating that the interests of the beneficiaries shall continue until this trust is revoked or terminated internal quotation marks omittedholding that a union health trust had standing to sue tobacco companies to recover medical expenses paid by the trust and allegedly caused by beneficiaries smokingholding that trust beneficiaries have no authority to maintain an action as third party beneficiaries of contracts between the trustee and agents of the trustee concerning the internal affairs of the trust & \n\nspecified different criminal penalties for violations of the Trafficking Act, which include restitution for a defendant\u2019s ill-gotten gains. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1593(b)(3). If the government wanted to seek penalties under the Trafficking Act, it was required to prosecute Defendants under the Trafficking Act. Having chosen to prosecute Defendants under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 241, it may seek only the penalties authorized by law for violations of that crime. The government has cited no authority \u2014 and we know of none \u2014 for the proposition that the district court may exceed its statutory authority simply because of the government\u2019s assertion that \u201cdefendants engaged in the same sort of behavior\u201d as a crime of which Defendants were not convicted.

The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v. Anderson, 303 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1981) (<HOLDING>). The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\n"}

See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v. Meza, 235 F.3d 287, 291 (7th Cir.2000); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (explaining that due process \u201ccalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\u201d). That said, the precedents shed some light on the government\u2019s obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurementholding us mail sufficient to give notice but mail cannot be expected to notify person who is missing or unknownholding rules of civil procedure are appropriate in determining what constitutes proper service by certified mailholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he was given sufficient notice of the administrative forfeiture proceeding through certified mailholding that if service done by certified mail action commenced upon receipt of summons and complaint & \n\nLetter are final orders relating to \u201caviation duties and powers,\u201d \u00a7 46110 preempts the district court from considering these claims. But if they are not final, then the Administrative Procedure Act (\u201cAPA\u201d) bars the district court from hearing the case for lack of jurisdiction. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. The finality requirement comes from two sections in the APA. An \u201corder\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018the whole or a part of a final disposition ... of an agency in a matter other than rule making.\u2019 \u201d Air Cal. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 654 F.2d 616, 620 (9th Cir.1981) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(6)). The APA only allows judicial review of \u201cfinal agency actions.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. Thus, if an FAA order is not final, neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction over the case. See Air Cal, 654 F.2d at 622 (<HOLDING>). As a result of the finality conundrum, the holding district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the document before the district court in this instance is not a vehicle for any recognized legal remedy under the rulesholding that this court lacked preliminary authority to review the district courts jurisdiction because there was no immediately appealable order before the courtholding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review state disciplinary proceedings against attorneyholding that this court lacked jurisdiction under 46110 for lack of finality and that the district court also lacked jurisdiction because the orders were not final and thus not ripe for reviewholding that plaintiffs lacked standing because the case was not ripe for adjudication & \n\nagency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. The civil forfeiture in Plaintiffs\u2019 case was achieved by a consent judgment in judicial proceedings; the civil forfeiture did not involve agency action. By its own terms, \u00a7 702 only applies where the party seeks judicial review of agency action. Because the instant forfeiture took place in the context of a civil judicial proceeding, there is no agency action for the district court or this Court to review. See Comm, of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of Columbia, 28 F.3d 130, 134 (D.C.Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). The APA therefore cannot be the basis for a holding that under the apa exhaustion is a prerequisite to judicial review when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review so long as the administrative action is made inoperative pending that reviewholding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordholding apa 5 usc 702 inapplicable because no agency proceeding took place for the court to reviewholding that the apa does not afford an implied grant of subjectmatter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency actionholding a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands & \n\nevade review. DEQ begins by observing that some federal courts have adopted a \u201crule of thumb\u201d that two years is an adequate time to obtain a final judicial decision on a challenge to a federal administrative agency order. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc., v. Hogan, 428 F3d 1059, 1064 (DC Cir 2005). The time it takes to fully litigate a challenge to a federal administrative agency order or rule, however, may be different from the time it would take to challenge an Oregon agency\u2019s order or rule under the Oregon Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, the \u201crule of thumb\u201d that DEQ identifies does not appear to have been uniformly followed by federal courts, particularly in cases involving challenges to NPDES permits. See, e.g., Trustees for Alaska v. EPA, 749 F2d 549, 555 (9th Cir 1984) (<HOLDING>); Montgomery Environmental Coalition v. Costle, recognizing a mootness exception for abortion litigation because pregnancy truly could be capable of repetition yet evading review holding that a party may not invoke the capable of repetition yet evading review exception where its failure to obtain prompt relief has prevented judicial reviewholding ease not moot when challenged administrative order expired because icc proceedings are continuing and their consideration ought not be defeated by short term orders capable of repetition yet evading reviewholding that we have no difficulty concluding that challenge to expired fiveyear npdes permit was capable of repetition yet evading reviewholding that challenge to expired fiveyear npdes permits originally issued eight years earlier was capable of repetition yet evading review & \n\nentities like GasPlus. See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The causation requirement is satisfied holding a deviation from the terms of a contract constitutes an impairment of contractholding that even though an executive order mandating agency consideration of environmental justice concerns created no private right of action for an agencys failure to comply with that mandate the court would review the agencys action as an exercise of discretion under the apa and nepaholding that the evidence must be sufficient to support the agencys findings of fact and that the agencys inferences from those facts must be reasonableholding that an agencys interference with a private partys contract rights constitutes an injury in factholding that potential loss of a contract constitutes irreparable injury & \n\nbecause CBFWA has alleged nineteen violations of the Agreement by BPA since 1991. However, because they are challenging only the decision to enter into the agreements, and are not suing for violations of the agreements, we do not consider this ground. 8 . BPA also cites Marathon Oil Co. v. United States, 807 F.2d 759, 767 (9th Cir.1986), for the proposition that, \"[a]s a general rule, we will not consider issues not presented before an administrative proceeding at the appropriate time.\u201d Insofar as Marathon Oil can be read to require exhaustion of administrative remedies before bringing a claim in federal court under section 10(c) of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704, it has been modified by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Darby v. Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 113 S.Ct. 2539, 125 L.Ed.2d 113 (1993) (<HOLDING>). 9 .

I address only the Forest Service\u2019s exhaustion claim as I conclude it is dispositive. The APA requires plaintiffs to exhaust' available administrative remedies before bringing their grievances to federal court. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704 (setting forth the APA\u2019s exhaustion requirement); see also 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6912(e) (requiring that plaintiffs \u201cexhaust all administrative appeal procedures\u201d before bringing an action against the Department of Agriculture); 36 C.F.R.

Cisneros, 509 U.S. 137, 154, 113 S.Ct. 2539, 125 L.Ed.2d 113 (1993) (<HOLDING>). The doctrine of exhaustion \u201ccuts down on the holding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordrecognizing that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not required as a prerequisite to bringing an action pursuant to 1983holding that under the apa exhaustion is a prerequisite to judicial review when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review so long as the administrative action is made inoperative pending that reviewholding that a courts authority to require exhaustion of administrative remedies in actions brought under the apa is limited when neither the statute nor agency rules specifically mandate exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial reviewholding that judicial review under the apa is precluded when a remedy is available under a citizen suit provision of an environmental statute citations omitted & \n\nreceived from the account. b.

Thus, if a reasonable fact finder evaluating the evidence could draw more than one inference from the facts, and if that inference introduces a genuine issue of material fact, then the court should not grant the summary judgment motion. See Augusta Iron & Steel Works, Inc., 835 F.2d at 856. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, it is well-established that the court may neither adjudge the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the evidence. See Pita v.

Although we reach the same result as the trial court, we do so taking a different route. \"Ordinarily, an appellate court will not affirm a summary judgment by ruling on a ground not ruled upon by the trial court.\u201d Thomas v.

Thus it was May 27, not May 26, when Harper fell from the tree. 5 . We have considered all of Harper's other arguments and find they lack merit. Harper claims, for example, that defendants could not have heard Perkins alert them to the gun in the tree because both defendants said they saw Harper holding the gun. Yet Harper testified that Gourley tasered him immediately after Perkins shouted the gun\u2019s location. From this testimony, which we must credit at summary judgment, we can only infer that defendants tasered Harper in response to Perkins's cry. The evidence does not support alternative inferences, e.g., that defendants would have tasered Harper even if they knew plaintiff could not reach the gun. See Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 1996) holding movant may not raise new grounds for summary judgment in reply to nonmovants responseholding that a superior court justice may not choose between conflicting inferences at summary judgment stageholding that district court should not have granted summary judgment solely on basis that motion for summary judgment was not opposedholding court need not withhold summary judgment if nonmovants inferences implausibleholding that nonmovants failure to except or respond cannot supply by default the grounds for summary judgment or the summary judgment proof necessary to establish the movants right & \n\npetition when the case was remanded to the circuit court from the federal court. As such, the appellant was blindsided by the trial court\u2019s judgment in that, prior to the judgment entry, it was never put on notice as to a Rule 55.09 justification for granting summary judgment. This would have been true even if the appellant had been given the requisite 30 days to respond. Without such notice, the appellant\u2019s due process right to respond to the respondent\u2019s motion was effectively denied by the trial court\u2019s failure to confine itself to the alleged undisputed facts of the summary judgment record made, providing an additional basis for us to reverse the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Mothershead v. Greenbriar Country Club, Inc., 994 S.W.2d 80, 85 (Mo.App.1999) (citation omitted) (<HOLDING>). II.

The District Court reserved decision. Because Jacob failed to renew his motion within ten days of the entry of final judgment, as is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b); Williams v. Guzzardi, 875 F.2d 46, 50 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989). In his reply brief, Jacob argues that even if he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law, we should nonetheless review his sufficiency of the evidence argument and, if we find that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, grant a new trial. Id. (<HOLDING>). But cf. Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d holding that even when a defendant moves under rule 50 at the close of plaintiffs evidence and autocentro did not even do that if a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the posttrial stage with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidenceholding that defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law which was denied by the district court when they made it at the close of the evidence limited the relief the appellate court could grant to a new trialholding in a capital case that the defendant waived his argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue where the trial court took the motion under advisement but the defendant failed to seek a ruling on the motion and failed to renew the motion after the jurors had been qualifiedholding that the defendants insufficientevidence claim was barred by his failure to renew his rule 29 motion at the close of all the evidence because there was no manifest miscarriage of justiceholding that an appellate court should not undertake to review whether a plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when the only motion filed and the only motion on appeal was the trial courts grant of summary judgment & \n\nnot a party to these state court eminent domain proceedings, and there is also no indication that he was in privity with any of the property owners involved in those proceedings. Without such a relationship, neither claim nor issue preclusion applies to plaintiffs claims before this court. F. ROOKER-FELDMAN Defendant CCRA also argues that all of plaintiffs claims are barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine. In certain circumstances, where a federal suit follows a state suit, the Rooker-Feldman doctrine prohibits a federal district court from exercising jurisdiction over the later-filed federal action. See Great Western Mining & Mineral Co. v. Fox Rothschild LLP, 615 F.3d 159, 163-64 (3rd Cir.2010); Rooker v.

We find that Gonzalez\u2019 status as a signatory to the agreements to cure default entered with Wilshire provides her with standing under the CFA. In the circumstances presented, Wilshire\u2019s arguments regarding the lack of privity between Gonzalez and Wilshire arising from the making of the initial loan and the issue of her status as a \u201cconsumer\u201d of that loan are irrelevant. A separate contractual relationship between Gonzalez and Wilshire exists that involves the loan, but does not arise directly from it. Further, we find that the monetary damages that Gonzalez claims to exist as the result of Wilshire\u2019s allegedly unconscionable practices, if proven, constitute the statutorily-required \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d Weinberg v. Sprint, Corp., 173 N.J. 233, 237, 801 A.2d 281 (2002) (<HOLDING>).

For example, the panel opinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski\u2019s assailant fled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he heard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police. Instead, the panel held that \u201cno rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski\u2019s screams.\u201d O\u2019Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 302. Although it would be entirely permissible for a jury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying the Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between competing reasonable inferences in this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). The panel opinion\u2019s method of analysis recognizing that circumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to demonstrate a defendants guiltholding that where the meaning of the jurys verdict was not clear in light of the trial courts jury instructions the court of appeals erred in directing entry of judgment for respondent the case should have been remanded to the trial judge who was in the best position to pass upon the question of a new trial in light of the evidence his charge to the jury and the jurys verdictholding that an agreement may be inferred entirely from circumstantial evidenceholding that in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jurys verdictrecognizing that competing inferences are not enough to disturb the jurys verdict even in a case where the evidence of the defendants guilt was entirely circumstantial & \n\nId. If there is evidence in the record, including affidavits, exhibits, interrogatory answers, and depositions, as to any material fact from which an inference could be drawn in favor of the non-movant, summary judgment is unavailable. See Lane v. New York State Electric & Gas Corp., 18 F.3d 172, 176 (2d Cir.1994). Notably, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s task at the summary judgment motion state of litigation is carefully limited to discerning whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried, not to decide them. Its duty, in short, is confined at this point to issue-finding, it does not extend to issue resolution.\u201d Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs. Ltd., 22 F.3d 1219, 1224 (2d Cir.1994); see Donahue v. Windsor Locks Board of Fire Commissioners, 834 F.2d 54, 57 (2d Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). B.

Here, we need not determine whether Osberg\u2019s \u00a7 204(h) notice claim is either timely or valid because \u00a7 204(h) does not, in any event, afford him the remedy he seeks, i.e., a pension benefit calculated under the cash balance plan but \u201cwith an opening balance equal to the value of the retirement annuity he had already earned under the old formula.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. 5.

As the District Court did neither of these and did not otherwise determine the rights and liabilities of the parties, McLaughlin\u2019s appeal is not yet ripe for review and cannot be heard by this court. Accord Francis v. Forest Oil Corp., 798 F.2d 147, 149-50 (5th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>); Upper Miss. Towing Corp. v. West, 338 F.2d holding that a pretrial order that the 500 cogsa limitation applied was not appealable under 28 usc 1292a3holding order setting aside summary judgment for procedural irregularity was not immediately appealableholding that where an adversary proceeding continues the order is no more a final decision than an order denying summary judgment or denying a request for additional discovery the litigation proceeds and the issue will be reviewed if it turns out to make a difference to an order that is independently appealableholding that an order denying summary judgment is not appealable under 1292a3 even though it may have had important procedural consequencesholding an order denying a motion for summary judgment is interlocutory and not appealable & \n\nonly relies on a self-serving affidavit. Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (stating that \u201csummary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition\u201d). The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nand perhaps the nature of the risk\u201d), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 439 U.S. 551, 99 S.Ct. 790, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979). As a result, the Court holds that Santana deserves no relief under section 1132 for denial of benefits because Deluxe did not violate 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1022. Accordingly, the Court grants summary judgment to Deluxe on Counts Two, Three, and Eight. Consequently, the Court denies Santana\u2019s motion on those counts. C. Contract Claim On Count Four, Deluxe moves for summary judgment by arguing that Santana\u2019s common law contract action is preempted by ERISA. See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).' Recognizing the expansive sweep of ERISA\u2019s preemption provision, the Court will grant summary judgment on this Count. See Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, 481 U.S. 41, 47, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987) (<HOLDING>); Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. holding that state law relates to an employee benefit plan and is therefore preempted by erisa if it has a connection with or reference to such a planholding breach of contract claim not preempted as a straightforward breach of contract action as it alleged violation of specific covenantholding breach of contract claim not preempted under holaholding that trial court erred by dismissing breach of contract claim because appellee made promises to perform specific acts in contract the breach of which would give rise to a breach of contract actionholding that state breach of contract action preempted because it relates to employee benefit plan & \n\nas the starting date for calculating Gasser\u2019s delay in filing suit. Thus, although the court credited Gasser\u2019s testimony at least to the extent that this meeting took place, it failed to draw reasonable inferences in favor of Gasser about what took place during this encounter. Given Gasser\u2019s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome. See, e.g., Vaupel Textilmaschinen KG v. Meccanica Euro Italia s.p.a., 944 F.2d 870, 878-79, 20 USPQ2d 1045, 1052 (Fed.Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>).

The willingness of a party to go to trial immediately and pay the expenses of the default judgment are important factors for the court to look to in determining whether it should grant a new trial. They are not dispositive of whether the motion should be granted. See Cliff, 724 S.W.2d at 779 (<HOLDING>); Angelo, 713 S.W.2d at 98 (noting that courts holding that motion for a new trial whether for guilt or punishment requires a valid legal claim a court cannot grant a new trial unless the defendant shows that he is entitled to one under the lawholding that an offer to reimburse plaintiff for costs is not a precondition but an important factor for trial court to look at in determining whether it should grant a new trialholding that the trial court can and should grant a new trial if the manifest weight of the evidence is contrary to the verdictholding that court should not use ending date of indictment as determination of when continuing violation ended but should look at the evidence introduced at trialrecognizing that an appellate court reviews a trial courts decision whether or not to grant equitable relief only for an abuse of discretion & \n\nthat Andrew breached his fiduciary duties. It rather, presents an issue for trial. IV. CONCLUSION The Arrearage Claim is a valid claim against the Estate. Otherwise, the competing motions for summary judgment are denied.

A credible argument against ERISA\u2019s preemption of such state exemption statutes exists and has been adopted by what one court has called an \u201cemerging minority.\u201d In re Kazi, 125 B.R. 981 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.1991). The Eighth Circuit has recently resolved this issue against the position taken by the trustee, by holding, \u201c... ERISA does not preempt state law exemptions of pension plan benefits reasonably necessary for the support of a debtor.\u201d In re Vickers, 954 F.2d 1426 (8th Cir.1992). However, when the Debtors asserted their exemptions the courts within the Eighth Circuit that had considered this pre-emption question had reached conflicting results and the Circuit Court had not yet ruled. See In re Gaines, 121 B.R. 1015 (W.D.Mo.1990) (<HOLDING>), compare, In re Vickers, 116 B.R. 149 holding that erisa completely preempted certain state law claims and finding that erisa preempted an employees common law tort and contract claim when the employee sought benefits under the employers disability policyholding a state workers compensation regime preempted by erisa to the extent state law applied to pension plans governed by federal lawholding that erisa does not preempt revstatmo 51343010e because it is entirely consistent with both erisa and the bankruptcy codeholding that to the extent revstatmo 51343010e affects erisa it is preemptedholding that a state election law is preempted only to the extent that it conflicts with federal law & \n\nthe case must be adjudicated before the NLRB. See Baker v.

It is a rule of primary jurisdiction, allocating to an administrative agency the first crack at certain matters.\u201d). Accordingly, Garmon preemption provides no basis for removal jurisdiction in federal court. A case falling within the scope of the doctrine must be adjudicated before the NLRB. The lower courts are uniform in finding that Garmon preemption under the NLRA does not completely preempt state laws so as to provide removal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Ethridge v. Harbor House Rest., 861 F.2d 1389, 1399-1400 (9th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>); Suarez v. Gallo Wine Distribs. LLC, No. 02 holding that a federal district court may decide whether an activity is an unfair labor practice under the nlra when the matter is raised as a defense to a claim under an independent federal remedy over which the federal district courts do have jurisdictionholding that district courts do not have appellate jurisdiction over state courtsholding that federal district courts have jurisdiction over violations of collective bargaining contracts even if such violations are also unfair labor practices subject to nlrb jurisdictionholding that garmon preemption provides no basis for removal jurisdiction in federal court and observing that the lower courts are uniform in finding that garmon preemption under the nlra does not completely preempt state laws so as to provide removal jurisdictionholding that gannon preemption does not constitute complete preemption for removal purposes because 7 and 8 of the nlra do not create jurisdiction in the federal district courts instead those provisions vest jurisdiction in the nlrb to determine unfair labor practices and state courts are as able to determine if jurisdiction belongs in the nlrb as are the federal district courts & \n\nconditions on defendants\u2019 land.\u201d Wilkerson, 845 S.W.2d at 750. Although the Wilkerson court also noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was \u201cfounded upon the duty of reasonable care owed to a social guest\/invitee by a social guest\/landowner,\u201d id., in light of the fact that the Statute does not itself distinguish between those duties, the Wilkerson case is best understood for its primary holding that the Statute does not apply where \u201c[t]he condition of the premises where the accident occurred is not at issue.\u201d Id. This holding is borne out by the substantial case law applying the Recreational Use Statute only in situations involving \u201cpremises liability\u201d and \u201cfailure to warn\u201d causes of action. See, e.g., Spence v. Tennessee Valley Authority, No. 3:05-0519, 2006 WL 1416759 at *4 (May 17, 2006) (<HOLDING>); Sumner v.

Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 281, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997). Here, we conclude that the Federal Power Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d) unmistakably evidences an intent to exclude licensees such as AmerenUE from maintaining an Ex Parte Young action seeking to prevent a State from recovering damages to its property resulting from the licensee\u2019s negligence in the operation of the licensed power project. Cf. Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. 44, 74, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996) (<HOLDING>). In relevant part, the Act provides: Each holding that the cwa does not include a remedial scheme sufficient to preclude an ex parte young actionholding that the medicaid act does not provide the type of detailed remedial scheme that would supplant an ex parte young actionholding that existence of a detailed remedial scheme shows congressional intent to prohibit recourse to the ex parte young fictionholding that ex parte young permits jurisdiction over officials who have authority to control the assessments of railroad taxes that are in violation of federal lawholding that the medicaid act provision allowing reduction of funds to noncompliant states is not a detailed remedial scheme sufficient to show congresss intent to preempt an action under ex parte young & \n\nexercise of discretion which is protected by FTCA \u00a7 2680(a).\u201d). Further, \u201c[u]nder a plain reading of this provision, practicability limits both the extent to which the USFS is required to eliminate safety hazards and the immediacy with which the USFS must correct high-priority hazards.\u201d Tam v. United States, 905 F.Supp.2d 1221, 1230 (W.D.Wash.2012). Specifically, Section 2332.1 \u201crequires the USFS to determine, within the confines of its many other responsibilities, how quickly to address high-priority hazards,\u201d and to use \u201cits discretion and policy judgment to choose which items to treat as \u2018high-priority\u2019 from among the nearly limitless category of potential hazards\u201d present in a National Forest area. Id. at 1231; see also Elder v. United States, 312 F.3d 1172, 1178 (10th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). Notably, the discretion vested in the Forest holding that police officers charge to protect the public differentiated them from the publicholding that federal law can provide source of state public policy for determining whether discharge of employee violated clear mandate of public policyholding that a national park service policy manuals broad mandate to warn the public of and protect it from special hazards involves the exercise of discretion in identifying such hazardsholding that for public policy reasons the mere filing of a bar complaint by a defendant against his attorney does not mandate removal of the attorneyholding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretion & \n\nby Eleventh Circuit case law. As discussed above, the Eleventh Circuit has found that a statute may refer to a class of persons or entities and require the government to take action relative to those persons or entities, but still not contain rights-creating language. See Arrington, 438 F.3d at 1345 (\u201c[E]ven though [the statute] contain[s] language requiring the state to take certain actions relative to individual foster children (e.g., the State shall file a petition [to terminate the parental rights of the child\u2019s parents], we determined [the statute] do[es] not have the kind of foeused-on-the-individual, rights-creating language required by Gon-zaga.\u201d) (quoting 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1272 (11th Cir.2003)). See also Coutu, 450 U.S. at 771-73, 101 S.Ct. 1451 (<HOLDING>).

Id. In other words, it held Mason County had a duty to warn the Osborns because Wiseman relied on its assurances. But that cannot support a duty under the rescue doctrine unless the Osborns reasonably relied on Wiseman. And the Osborns fail to show such reliance. Because Mason County had no duty to warn the Osborns \u2014 under the rescue doctrine or any other theory of liability \u2014 it is entitled to summary judgment. A.

In one ease, the condition is the foreseeable result of the doctor\u2019s omission; in the other, it is not. The majority\u2019s result is unprecedented in any jurisdiction. In every previous failure-to-warn case, the harm about which the doctors failed to warn was the harm that in fact occurred. See, e.g., Estate of Doe v. Vanderbilt Univ., 824 F.Supp. 746 (M.D.Tenn.1993) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v.

Further, the district court found that the sill continued to perform its function in its current completely submerged condition. Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s negligence finding based on the failure to place a warning sign at the sill\u2019s location was not clearly erroneous, appellants\u2019 argument that the failure to maintain the sill was not within the discretionary function exception is irrelevant. Throughout the proceeding appellants asserted that the United States was negligent for failing to maintain the sill in its original condition. Indeed, the district court found that as originally designed the sill extended across the entire width of the cut and the edge 467, 473 (5th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>), appeal after remand, 897 F.2d 795 (5th recognizing that initial decision to place buoy 60 from wreck was a protected discretionary function but moving the buoy another 250 away from the wreck without notifying the public was a negligent act not within the discretionary function exceptionrecognizing a discretionary function exception to that waiverholding that the discretionary function exception may apply in the absence of a conscious decision holding that decision to establish recreational swimming area was discretionary but failure to replace buoy secured by an anchor that injured a swimmer was not within discretionary function exceptionholding that an agent acting outside his delegated authority is not protected by the discretionary function exception & \n\nRogers v.

Accordingly, we must reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Mrs. Tompkin\u2019s design defect and failure to warn claims. B. Mrs. Tompkin additionally contends that the district court erred in concluding that OPLA preempted her negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct claims. This court has applied OPLA to product Lability negligence claims and has therefore implicitly concluded that common law negligence claims have been preempted by OPLA. See Amendola, 1999 WL 1111515, at *2 (<HOLDING>). Additionally, the Faugh court, using the recognizing torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distressholding that the plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims are governed by oplaholding that a party claiming negligent infliction of emotional distress cannot recover for emotional disturbance aloneholding that plaintiffs negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims are not independent of the breach of contract claim and summary judgment is warranted on these claimsholding negligent misrepresentation sufficient & \n\nDelta Airlines and Gary Richter contend that because Plaintiffs breach of contract claim arises out of events which occurred during the course of embarkation of an international flight, her claim is preempted by the Montreal Convention. Plaintiff responds that her claim falls outside the scope of the Convention because she alleges nonperformance of a contract. Although the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals has not addressed this issue, a number of other federal courts have concluded that where the complaint alleges complete nonperformance of a contract, rather than delay in transportation, the Montreal Convention does not preempt a plaintiffs breach of contract claim. See, e.g., Nankin v. Continental Airlines, Inc., No. CV-09-07851, 2010 WL 342632, at *7 (C.D.Cal. Jan. 29, 2010) (<HOLDING>); Mullaney v.

If it involves the NLRA and another federal statute, then the Garmon doctrine is inapplicable as a general rule unless the underlying federal claim is illegal only by way of the NLRA. That is, if the defendant\u2019s conduct is perfectly legal but for the proscriptions of the NLRA, then those determinations of potential illegality should be left to the expertise of the NLRB. Likewise, if the conduct in question is federally chargeable independent of the NLRA (even if it is also arguably covered by the NLRA), then the Garmon doctrine does not apply because the two implicated federal statutes may both be given their intended purpose. See, e.g., Smith v. Nat\u2019l Steel & Shipbuilding Co., 125 F.3d 751, 754-57 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

See supra note 11 and accompanying text. 16 .Kazakhstan\u2019s contention that as a civil law jurisdiction it does not recognize common law torts, may be still further evidence that Kazakhstan did not intend to waive immunity for tort claims like those asserted here. See Kazakhstan Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim, at 9-10. In light of the significant ambiguities concerning waiver noted in the text, we need not rely on this point to decide this case, and hence need not consider Kazakhstan's representation regarding its legal system.

See also Zeng Liu, 207 F.Supp.2d at 193 (denying defendant\u2019s request to discover information relating to plaintiffs immigration status because such information is both irrelevant and the need for its disclosure outweighed by the risk of injury to the plaintiffs, even if the parties were to enter into a confidentiality agreement); Cabrera, 695 N.W.2d at 81 (<HOLDING>).

The only circuit court to have considered whether the PMPA triggers the complete preemption doctrine is the Ninth Circuit, which found that it did not. Yorn v.

In other words, the Virginia Act would in no way foreclose the availability of a federal maritime tort claim to plaintiff until plaintiff himself elected to subject himself to the Virginia Act\u2019s exclusivity provision by affirmatively availing himself of its benefits. Such a mode of analysis might not implicate federalism and Supremacy Clause concerns so much as questions of the limits of contract, release, and waiver: i.e., whether an injured worker may contract effectively to waive his right to bring a federal maritime tort claim in exchange for access to supplemental state disability benefits. But see, e.g., Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., 370 U.S. 114, 131, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962) (<HOLDING>).

The district court did not clearly err in finding that this evidence supported a pattern of deception attributable to Littrice and that by excluding from the group of 662 returns all cases in which the taxpayer contested their audit or where no additional tax was due, the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the remaining returns reflected Littrice\u2019s relevant conduct.

It is irrelevant what else Platt might have learned through further diligent investigation after 1999 about UL\u2019s misrepresentations or intent to deceive Platt and others regarding the Cadet heaters\u2019 safety, because in 1999 Platt already knew that UL\u2019s prior representations about the heaters\u2019 safety were false, and that knowledge was sufficient to trigger the statute of limitations for fraud under California law.

The Rental Housing Act confers primary jurisdiction over rent overcharge petitions upon the Rent Administrator, the designated head of the Rental Accommodations and Conversion Division (RACD). See D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 45-2513(a), - 2514(c), -2526(a) (1996); Drayton v. Poretsky Management, Inc., 462 A.2d 1115, 1120 (D.C.1983) (<HOLDING>). 2 . Petitioners asserted, \u201cthe record shows holding that where a superior court judge was named a defendant in an action for a writ of mandamus the prosecuting attorney is the proper court representative of the superior court judgeholding the fact remains however that such standard appears to be the law of this state as enunciated in the decisions of the court of appeals discussed previously unless those decisions are either explained away or overruled by the court of appeals itself this court must follow what a majority of its members discern to be the precept to be drawn from them ie proof of fraud in a civil action either in law or in equity must be clear and convincing only the court of appeals could disabuse of that notionholding that superior court judge may not undertake to adjudicate the validity of a rent increase but rather must stay any pending action to await the rulings of the rent administrator and if appeals are taken of the commission and this courtholding superior court lacked authority to remand to commissionholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supports & \n\n\u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense,\u201d id at \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n.ll(A). To determine the applicability of this enhancement, the district court may consider all relevant conduct. Id. at \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A)-(B). Since .the court may consider all relevant conduct, it follows that the court\u2019s assessment is not \u201climited to the charged conspiracy.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Shippley, 690 F.3d 1192, 1200 (10th Cir. 2012) (noting that \u201ca \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) enhancement applies if a dangerous weapon was present or possessed during uncharged drug trafficking activity that constitutes relevant conduct under \u00a7 1B1.3\u201d (citing United States v. Roederer, 11 F.3d 973, 982 (10th Cir. 1993))); see also United States v. Mitchell, 528 Fed.Appx. 800, 806 (10th Cir. 2013) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis in original). Further, we have held holding that the 2d11b1 enhancement is not limited to the charged conspiracyholding that the 2d11b1 enhancement was proper where a firearm and drugrelated items were found in the defendants residence where he had also engaged in conspiratorial conversationsholding that the defendant on remand may show his eligibility for the safety valve reduction by a preponderance of the evidence even where a 2d11b1 enhancement appliedholding that heightened evidentiary standard of proof is not required where the sentencing enhancement is based entirely on the extent of the conspiracy to which the defendant pled guiltyholding that the notion of enterprise conspiracy has largely rendered the old distinction between single conspiracy and multiple conspiracy irrelevant to rico conspiracy charges & \n\nthe website looked like Heather. But in analyzing a judicial deception claim, we need not scrutinize police investigative tactics in this fashion. 10 . As discussed above, the materiality of an omission is an issue for the court. 11 . The Ewings quote Shirk's testimony from Prater and Memory's trial, but the officers obviously did not have this information at the time they prepared the warrant affidavit. The Ewings also fault the officers for not asking Shirk more questions, such as whether he had been drinking, how long he looked at the female, whether her helmet face shield was up or down, and what the lighting conditions were. But judicial deception claims do not require an inquiry into the quality of the police investigation. See generally Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-36, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (<HOLDING>). 12 . After the Ewings' arrest, Contreras did holding that allegations in a pro se complaint are to be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the complaint submitted by a pro se plaintiff must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the allegations in a pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersrecognizing that because affidavits are typically drafted in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation by nonlawyers they must be read with an understanding of that context and accordingly held to a lower standard of scrutiny than that applied to pleadings filed in more formal proceedingsholding that affidavits for search warrants must be interpreted in a commonsense and realistic fashion because they are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation & \n\ncategory of II, the probation officer set Peterson\u2019s sentencing range at 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment. At the sentencing on January 23, 2009, Peterson challenged the USSG \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(2) enhancement, contending that the enhancement did not apply because her structuring offense did not involve \u201ca pattern of unlawful activity,\u201d which is defined as \u201cat least two separate occasions of unlawful activity ..., without regard to whether any such occasion occurred during the course of the offense or resulted in a conviction for the conduct that occurred on that occasion.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2S1.3, comment, (n.3). According to Peterson, if the structured money came from one source, here her safe deposit box, there could be only one offense, see United States v. Davenport, 929 F.2d 1169, 1172 (7th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>), and thus no pattern of unlawful activity, holding due process clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the charged offense and new york law that requires the defendant in a second degree murder prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter when no element of the charged offense is presumed does not violate the due process clauseholding the proper unit of prosecution for indecent liberties is the number of discrete actsholding that the statute was ambiguous because it provides no definition of the term violation and provides no specific direction as to the proper unit of prosecutionholding that the structuring itself and not each individual deposit is the unit of prosecution in a structuring offenseholding that test for whether two offenses are not the same is whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not & \n\ntrial court to have granted a 30-day grace period, in light of the fact that Schorp\u2019s attorney failed to file an expert report in compliance with the statute\u2019s requirements, would have undermined the statute\u2019s intent. For that reason, appellant\u2019s fourth issue cannot be sustained. Therefore, we overrule appellant's fourth issue. 4 . Bell and Baptist assert relevant questions which a jury would have to consider and would necessitate an expert's opinion: for example, (1) whether the decision to use an arterial line was within the appropriate standard of care; (2)what are the appropriate procedures for an arterial line insertion; (3) what other possible medical causes could exist; (4) what should have been the appropriate medical treatment or intervention? See Haddock, 793 S.W.2d at 953 (<HOLDING>); Odak, 934 S.W.2d at 873 (holding that the holding that affidavit of merit is not required in common knowledge casesrecognizing common knowledge exceptionrecognizing a common knowledge exceptionholding that administering of a hypodermic needle for the purpose of anesthesia was not within laymans common knowledgeholding that a reason to combine may come from the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art the nature of the problem to be solved or common knowledge and common sense & \n\nas \"a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable [investor].\u201d TSC Indus., Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 449, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976); see Healey v. Catalyst Recovery of Pennsylvania, Inc., 616 F.2d 641, 647 (3d Cir.1980). The alleged concealment of both the conflict of interest, Press, 218 F.3d at 130, and the excessive commissions, Ettinger, 835 F.2d at 1033, satisfy the materiality requirement. 55 . While the QPA-2 and the fixed portions of the other annuities were not \"securities\u201d under federal securities laws, because they were part of the putative pay-to-play scheme, they cannot be used to support a civil RICO claim. See Bald Eagle, 189 F.3d at 329-30 (<HOLDING>). As such, the Court rejects Plaintiff's holding breach of best execution duty is a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of the securitiesholding that a plaintiff alleging securities fraud must show that a defendant 1 made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he or she had a duty to speak 2 with scienter 3 in connection with the purchase or sale of securitiesholding that evidence was sufficient to support convictions for willfully engaging in fraudulent conduct in connection with sale of securities because kjnowledge that the act violates the securities laws is not relevantholding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase sale or issuance of the instrumentholding that 1 even if some conduct is not actionable as securities fraud that conduct cannot support a civil rico claim if it was also undertaken in connection with the purchase of a security and 2 conduct in maintaining ponzi scheme was conduct undertaken in connection with the purchase or sale of securities & \n\nconviction for reasons unrelated to the merits of the underlying criminal proceedings, the respondent remains \u2018convicted\u2019 for immigration purposes.\u201d 23 I. & N. Dec. at 624; see also Herrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299, 306 (1st Cir.2000) (\u201c[A] subsequent dismissal of charges, based solely on rehabilitative goals and not on the merits of the charge or on a defect in the underlying criminal proceedings, does not vitiate that original admission [of guilt].\u201d). Nothing in Pickering precludes a stipulated vacatur from invalidating a conviction as a ground for removal or for other immigration purposes, provided that the vacatur is still based on a defect in the underlying conviction rather than rehabilitative or otherwise proscribed grounds. See Pinho v. Gonzales, 432 F.3d 193 (3rd Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); Cruz-Garza v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d at 1131 holding that a prior conviction obtained in violation of a defendants constitutional rights cannot be used as the underlying conviction in a prosecution under colorados felon with a gun statuteholding the petitioners challenge of his conviction is not rendered moot by the expiration of the underlying sentence because collateral consequences flowing from the conviction give the petitioner a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on himholding that the petitioners vacatur obtained by settlement rather than adjudication meets the pickering standard because the petitioner claimed a defect in his underlying convictionholding that standard of review is a matter of procedural rather than substantive lawholding that it is the conduct required to obtain a conviction rather than the consequences resulting from the crime that is relevant & \n\nis so excessive that it violates due process can involve consideration of whether the punitive damages award exceeded the amount necessary to accomplish the goals of punishment and deterrence. Murray v. Laborers Union Local No. 324, 55 F.3d 1445, 1453 (9th Cir.1995) (citing Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 17, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991)). The Supreme Court did not reject deterrence as a legitimate factor in the consideration of whether or not an award is unconstitutionally excessive in either BMW or State Farm. See BMW, 517 U.S. at 584, 116 S.Ct. 1589 (noting only that deterrence could not justify a punitive damages award without considering whether less drastic measures could be expected to achieve that goal); State Farm, 538 U.S. at 419, 123 S.Ct. 1513 (<HOLDING>). Moreover, in a post-BMW case, the Ninth holding that conduct must be beyond the fraud which supported compensatory damages to award punitive damagesholding prebmw that deterrence is relevant to the determination of constitutionally permissible punitive damagesrecognizing that deterrence relates to reprehensibility in that the conduct must be so reprehensible as to warrant imposition of punitive damages as a further sanction to achieve punishment and deterrencerecognizing the conduct giving rise to punitive damages must be a proximate cause of the harm inflictedholding that perhaps the most important indicium of the reasonableness of a punitive damages award is the degree of reprehensibility of the defendants conduct & \n\nfor radiologists to or urologists or anybody else of the same specialty. Similarly, Dr. Venegas testified that as a family physician, he does not implant pacemakers and he would defer to the knowledge of a cardiologist on that issue. When Dr. Venegas was asked if he believed Dr. Feldman deviated from the standard of care in her treatment of Mr. Melton, he responded, \u201cI cannot see where from the note[s] that I\u2019ve been given from [Dr. Feldman] that she deviated from the standard of care in her medical treatment of Mr. Melton.\u201d Dr. Gaddy and Dr. Venegas failed to establish the standard of care for implanting ICDs, and therefore, their testimony was insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. See Botehlo v. Bycura, 282 S.C. 578, 587, 320 S.E.2d 59, 65 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, Melton presented no evidence holding that expert medical testimony was not necessary to establish negligence where surgeon left a needle in the patients body but stating that proof of proximate cause requires some expert testimony in medical malpractice casesholding that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment since the physical evidence and unrebutted expert testimony left no genuine issue of material factholding no issue of material fact as to whether defendant was volunteer because he received no compensationholding expert testimony by an orthopedic surgeon in a case of alleged medical malpractice by a podiatrist failed to create a genuine issue of material fact because 1 the material question in the case was the standard required of podiatrists not orthopedic surgeons 2 the witness admitted he was not familiar with the procedure the defendant performed and 3 when the orthopedic surgeon was asked if he held himself out as an expert he answered no not in podiatry noholding that expert testimony is unnecessary when orthopedic surgeon failed to remove two pieces of cement totaling oneinch in diameter after affixing prosthesis for hip replacement & \n\ninference, however, is totally lacking because the corrective work contained three important elements that were not present in the original plans: (1) a waterproofing agent was added, (2) expanding foam insulation sealed any gaps between the structural support and the Styrofoam block, and (3) butyl caulk sealant was applied to the top of all T superstructures. A party claiming a breach of contract must establish by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that there was a contract, (2) that the other party breached the contract and, (3) that the party asserting breach of contract suffered damages as a result of the breach. Stevenson v Brotherhoods Mut Benefit, 312 Mich 81, 90-91; 19 NW2d 494 (1945); Residential Ratepayer Consortium v Pub Serv Comm, 198 Mich App 144, 149; 497 NW2d 558 (1993) (<HOLDING>); see M Civ JI 142.01. This standard means the holding that the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidenceholding the fedrevid 801d2e requires proof of the conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence and allows consideration of the offered declaration as part of the proof of the conspiracyrecognizing that the preponderance of the evidence is the quantum of proof in civil casesholding that the standard of proof in revocation proceedings is a preponderance of the evidenceholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\n"}
