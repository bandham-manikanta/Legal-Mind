This assignment of error is without merit. II. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE JURY WAS SELECTED \u00b6 7. Robinson assigns error to the trial court\u2019s method of jury selection. Robinson\u2019s only claim rests on a vague recitation of Rule 4.05(2) of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court without any additional argument or citation to authority in support thereof. Robinson maintains a full panel of accepted jurors was not tendered to him after the State exercised its first round in the jury selection. Robinson is incorrect and misinterprets the selection procedure outlined in URCCC 4.05(2). Under URCCC 4.05(2) a full panel of jurors, meaning twelve, are tendered by the State after electing to exer , 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (<HOLDING>), neither of which are applicable to the holding that generally an unsworn statement by counsel is not evidence in the context of a batson hearingholding that evidence of the same name and that the former conviction was in same city and same court as the present case and the fact that the defendant did not offer any testimony to rebut the prima facie evidence of identity was sufficient to establish identityholding that probation does not constitute a sentenceholding that a defendants confirmation of a psrs findings does not waive a challenge on appeal where there is no conceivable strategic reason for not objecting to a sentence at a higher offense levelholding that racial identity between the objecting defendant and the excluded jurors does not constitute a relevant precondition for a batson challenge & \n\nclerk\u2019s practice of almost always granting deferrals to jurors who requested them introduced a substantial element of voluntariness into jury service, and meant that the pool of K jurors consisted of individuals who had decided for various reasons not to serve at the time that their names were drawn from the divisional qualified wheels. As the former Fifth Circuit explained, \u201cThat the introduction of predilections of prospective jurors affects the random nature of the selection process cannot be gainsaid. Surely a district would be in substantial violation of the statute [JSSA] if it selected all its jurors by randomly drawing names from the qualified wheel and allowing those selected to opt in or out at will.\u201d Id.; see also United States v. Branscome, 682 F.2d 484, 485 (4th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). Arguably, then, when the clerk almost always holding the connection is an elementholding that use of volunteer jurors introduced an impermissible subjective element into jury selectionrecognizing that observations made during a psychiatric examination contain a subjective elementholding that a jury instruction directing the verdict on one element deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination on every element of the charged offense and thus constituted structural errorholding that knowledge element could not be deemed in favor of plaintiff where defendant objected to the omission of that element from the jury charge & \n\nmet their burden, and that inquiry into the deliberative process is precluded by Rule 606(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. This Court agrees that the Koenigs waived any claim of juror bias by not advising the Court of these allegations at a time when the Court could have done something about them. This Court conducted voir dire to find out whether any member of the jury panel recognized any of the defendants or had provided goods or services to Coastal. One member of the panel was excused due to his familiarity with the defendants. None of the jurors acknowledged any relationship or familiarity before they were empaneled. Waiver has been found where juror misconduct was only alleged, as in the Koenigs\u2019 case. See, e.g., United States v. Dean, 667 F.2d 729, 730, 734 (8th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). Waiver has also been found where there was holding that where possible juror misconduct is brought to the trial judges attention he or she has a duty to investigate and to determine whether there may have been a violation of the sixth amendmentholding that it was not constitutionally permissible for the state to respond to defendants invocation of his statutory right to appeal by bringing a more serious charge against him prior to the trial de novo holding that litigants have a duty to disclose their objection to a prospective juror by promptly bringing the matter to the attention of the trial courtholding that although this court affords broad discretion to the district court in determining the type of investigation necessary to determine juror bias the district court must provide the defendant a meaningful opportunity to prove the sameholding that the defendant by not bringing his knowledge of possible juror bias to the attention of the district court prior to verdict waived his right to a new trial & \n\nmatter illustrates the impossibility of an adequate appellate review. During voir dire, the State inquired whether any of the prospective jurors or members of their families had experienced drug addiction problems, and it appears from the transcript that several answered affirmatively. Unfortunately, they are not identified by name or juror number. This is critical because Mr. McKenzie alleged that the State improperly exercised a peremptory challenge on the sole African-American member of the jury panel. The gist of Mr. McKenzie\u2019s argument was that the reason advanced by the State to sustain its challenge, although appearing race neutral, was pretextual. See Melbourne v. State, 679 So.2d 759 (Fla.1996). The Assistant State Attorney expressed concern that the juror seemed d 1994) (<HOLDING>). As did the Florida Supreme Court in Delap v. holding that defendants have a right to be present at voir direholding that when the purpose of the request is to compare the testimony of jurors but no such comparison was made at the trial level a court need not provide a free voir dire transcriptholding that trial minutes were not sufficient substitute for transcript of voir dire and could not afford meaningful review when both sides exercised peremptory challengesholding that the selection of the jury constitutes part of a public trialholding that missing portions of transcript of voir dire did not entitle the defendant to a new trial for murder because the alleged errors in jury selection were harmless as a matter of law & \n\njurors 7, 9, 20, 41,43, 65, and 84 as those who expressed concerns about the facts of the case. None of these individuals were ultimately empaneled: five were excused for cause because they stated they could not be fair and impartial, one was stricken by the defense using a peremptory challenge, and one was not selected. See State v. Rackley, 2000-NMCA-027, \u00b6 9, 128 N.M. 761, 998 P.2d 1212 (explaining that \u201c[t]he jury selection process, including the excusal of jurors for cause, insures that a defendant is tried before an impartial jury\u201d). Finally, Defendant had two remaining peremptory challenges at the conclusion of jury selection and has not offered an explanation as to why she did not exercise those challenges. See State v. Isiah, 1989-NMSC-063, \u00b6 29, 109 N.M. 21, 781 P.2d 293 (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds by State v. holding that a white defendant can object to the exclusion of minority jurors through the use of peremptory challengesholding that a defendants exercise of peremptory challenges is not denied or impaired when the defendant chooses to use a peremptory challenge to remove a juror who should have been excused for causeholding that is not the fact that a jury is all white or all black that violates batson rather it is the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges to strike jurorsholding that the defendant was precluded from asserting error where the defendant had used all of his peremptory challenges and did not ask for moreholding that where a defendant does not use all of his or her peremptory challenges the defendant may not complain of prejudice for failure to dismiss prospective jurors & \n\n637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). A federal habeas court must grant relief if it is in \u201cgrave doubt\u201d as to the harmlessness of the error. O\u2019Neal v.

In our view, this \"reasonable belief\u201d standard raises a whole host of questions but supplies very few answers.

Shapiro, 994 F.Supp. 146, holding that defendants right to discovery was satisfied by inspection of master lists and the relevant demographic data about the general pool from which the grand jurors were selected and thus defendants were not entitled to the names addresses and demographics of the individual grand jurors who returned indictments against themholding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding that right was available in grand jury proceedingsholding that the prosecuting attorneys failure to instruct grand jurors on the record of the elements of the relevant criminal offenses warranted dismissal of the indictment without a showing of prejudiceholding that racial discrimination in selection of grand jurors compelled dismissal of indictment & \n\nhis request for a jury shuffle. Appellant contends his substantial rights have been affected and that he is entitled to a new trial. A defendant has an absolute right to a shuffle of the jury panel. Tex. Code CRIm. PRoc. Ann. art. 35.11 (Vernon Supp.2002); Jones v. State, 833 S.W.2d 146, 147 (Tex.Crim.App.1992). The motion for a jury shuffle must be made before voir dire begins. Williams v. State, 719 S.W.2d 573, 577 (Tex.Crim.App.1986) (en banc). Voir dire generally begins when the trial court recognizes the State as having started the examination. Id., In Davis, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals modified Williams in holding that in capital felony cases, voir dire begins when the trial court begins its examination of the panel. Davis v. State, 782 S.W.2d 211, 216 (Tex.Crim.App.1989) (<HOLDING>). The Davis court, while recognizing the role holding that the extent to which parties may examine prospective jurors on voir dire lies within the trial judges discretionholding that defendants have a right to be present at voir direholding that the legislature intended the trial court to be more involved in the voir dire procedure in capital felony casesholding that appellant failed to meet his burden of showing that the trial court violated his right to a public trial by sealing jury questionnaires used in open court during voir direholding that the jurors failure to remember particular facts inquired about on voir dire and the jurors misunderstanding of voir dire questions do not constitute probable prejudice & \n\nacquittals on others indicate that the jury was not unanimous regarding any of the counts. But even if his speculation is accurate, it-would provide no basis for interviewing the jurors because juror testimony with regard to a verdict\u2019s validity is limited to whether \u201cextraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury\u2019s attention; an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 606(b). K. Kennedy\u2019s theory of a compromise verdict fits none of these exceptions. Rather, it is an allegation of improper \u201cinternal influence,\u201d which this court has held cannot provide a basis for post-verdict juror interrogation. See United States v. Logan, 250 F.3d 350, 380-81 (6th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); Helm v. Bunch, No. 88-5120, 869 F.2d 1490, holding that the trial courts in camera interviews were within its discretion because the defendant had waived his right to be present during the juror interviewsholding that juror interviews were not permissible where the alleged jury misconduct of premature deliberations constituted internal influenceholding that rule 606b precludes any inquiry into the validity of the verdict based on juror testimony regarding racial or ethnic comments made during the course of deliberations but that the rule against juror impeachment cannot be applied so inflexibly as to bar juror testimony in those rare and grave cases where claims of racial or ethnic bias during jury deliberations implicate a defendants right to due process and an impartial jury internal quotation marks omittedholding a new trial required when juror is replaced by an alternate during jury deliberationsholding that the district courts dismissal of a juror after five weeks of deliberations violated the defendants right to a unanimous jury because the record evidence suggested the juror found the evidence insufficient for a conviction & \n\nhelp establish the existence of an unconstitutional practice or custom \u2014 cannot be readily deduced from simply reading the definition of practice or custom in Model Instruction 9.4. See Model Instruction 9.4 (\u201c \u2018Practice or custom\u2019 means any permanent, widespread, well-settled practice or custom that constitutes a standard operating procedure of the defendant.\u201d); see also Norwood, 591 F.3d at 1067 (observing that \u201cjuries are not clairvoyant\u201d and will not know to follow a particular legal principle \u201cunless they are told to do so\u201d). Accordingly, in the context of this case the definition of practice or custom in Model Instruction 9.4 was \u201can incomplete, and therefore incorrect, statement of the law.\u201d Norwood, 591 F.3d at 1066; see also Fikes v. Cleghorn, 47 F.3d 1011, 1013 (9th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Further, by stating that a practice or custom holding that if jury instructions viewed as a whole fairly state the applicable law to the jury the failure to give particular instructions will not be errorholding that a jury is presumed to follow the trial courts instructionsholding that the ninth circuit erred because the state appellate courts conclusion that one incorrect statement in jury instructions did not render the instructions likely to mislead the jury was not unreasonableholding that jury instructions must allow the jury to determine the issues presented intelligentlyholding that district court did not abuse its discretion in giving jury instructions that taken together fairly and adequately conveyed the issues to the jury & \n\nto credit and what reasonable inferences to draw from that evidence. For example, the panel opinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski\u2019s assailant fled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he heard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police. Instead, the panel held that \u201cno rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski\u2019s screams.\u201d O\u2019Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 302. Although it would be entirely permissible for a jury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying the Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between competing reasonable inferences in this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>).

The Fifth and the Eighth Circuits read \u00a7 1867 to mean a defendant pursing a constitutional challenge to a jury pool need not comply with its provisions. See United States v.

Utah Const, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, 12. Defendant concedes that the United States Supreme Court has rejected this argument under the United States Constitution. Lockhart v.

Quoting the Supreme Court, the panel instructed that: [I]n cases of bankruptcy, many incidental questions arise in the course of administering the bankrupt estate, which would ordinarily be pure cases at law, and in respect of their facts triable by jury, but, as belonging to the bankruptcy proceedings, they become cases over which the bankruptcy court, which acts as a court of equity, exercises exclusive control. Thus a claim of debt or damages against the bankrupt is investigated by chancery methods. Id. at 1503 (quoting Katchen v.

The justification for detaining appellant was markedly enhanced when Officer Chih learned (before taking him to the show-up) that appellant had recently arrived at the apartment (making it more likely that he was out in the neighborhood at the time of the robbery). Assessing the totality of these circumstances, the trial court properly avoided the \u201csort of divide-and-conquer analysis\u201d in which appellant engages. Arvizu, 534 U.S. at 274, 122 S.Ct. 744. It did not err in concluding that the police acted reasonably in commanding appellant not to make any sudden moves, in patting him down to check for weapons, and in detaining him until the show-up procedure was complete.

As noted above, the officer who frisked Terry did so not because he believed Terry had committed a crime, but because he believed Terry was going to do so. Accordingly, if an officer reasonably suspects a person is about to commit a crime, a protective pat search is warranted in the interests of officer and community safety. United States v. Peep, 490 F.2d 903, 905 (8th Cir. 1974) (concluding a pat search for weapons reasonable when officers knew the defendant had bragged about shooting a police officer); State v.

In short, nothing of substance appears in the record to justify the frisk of Owens except for the inarguable fact that he was a passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who possessed a crack pipe. Although further questioning may have revealed that the officer did have, in fact, articulable and independent suspicions that Owens was armed or dangerous, those reasons were not explicitly brought forth during the brief suppression hearing. 21 .

When a police officer turns on his or her emergency and takedown lights under these circumstances, a reasonable person would expect to be stopped, at a minimum, for a traffic infraction and perhaps for the crime of fleeing and eluding if he or she drove away. See \u00a7 316.126, Fla. Stat. (1999); State v. McCune, 772 So.2d 596 (Fla. 5th DCA 2000). Accordingly, the use of such lights cer who has initiated a consensual encounter may turn on his emergency lights for reasons of traffic safety during the consensual encounter. In this case, there is no dispute that the deputy lacked a well-founded suspicion that Mr. Hrezo had committed or was about to commit a crime when he turned on his emergency lights.

In essence, we conclude that, because the police did not suspect criminal wrongdoing and were not investigating criminal activity, the officers could ask defendant to step out of the car and, incident to their good faith performance of their \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d function, conduct a \u201cpat down\u201d incident to placing him in the police car for the limited period necessary to inquire about the \u201cmissing person\u201d report.

Additionally, while a hotel room may differ slightly from an in-home situation, Defendant and Nishimura still had the opportunity to hide weapons in the room just as they would have in a home. Because Nishimura was tasked with packing her belongings, the officers believed it necessary to secure the area from any danger posed to them. The Government argues that in the instant case, it would have been unreasonable for Special Agent Nutter to have left the drawer unsearched and jeopardized the safety of all present should Nishimura have gained access to a loaded gun.

Guided by this Supreme Court prece-' dent, we have also required that immigration officers have reasonable suspicion to briefly stop individuals to question them regarding their immigration status and probable cause for any further arrest and detention.

Many of these states simply cited a case from the federal circuit that covers the state to support their approach to this issue. {33} We disagree with the reasoning of the Seventh and Fifth Circuits and the state courts that follow them because it ignores the scope requirement of the second-prong of the Terry test, which our case law has consistently recognized as appropriate to analyze traffic stops. As we said in Werner, an officer\u2019s actions during the \u201cinvestigatory detention must be reasonably related to the circumstances that initially justified the stop.\u201d 117 N.M. at 317, 871 P.2d at 973; see, e.g., Taylor, 1999-NMCA-022, \u00b6 20, 126 N.M. 569, 973 P.2d 246 (<HOLDING>). We feel the cases relied upon by the Seventh holding that police officers are entitled to conduct an investigatory stop of a motorist if they have reasonable suspicion that the motorist has committed a traffic violationholding that where police officers had stopped a vehicle because they suspected that the motorist was intoxicated irrespective of whether the deputies were justified in detaining the motorist after he showed no signs of intoxication and even if they had not after approaching the motorist observed conditions raising a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot they were entitled to ask the motorist for permission to search his vehicleholding that defendant was unreasonably seized under fourth amendment when officer detained him to ask questions unrelated in scope to the reasons that justified the initial traffic stopholding that for purposes of determining whether the roadblock worked a fourth amendment seizure the controlling considerations are whether 1 the motorist was meant to be stopped by the physical obstacle of the roadblock and 2 the motorist was so stoppedholding that any questions an officer asks of a stopped motorist must be reasonably related to the circumstances which justified his initial stop & \n\n(\u201c[T]he officer\u2019s suspicions need not be inconsistent with a hypothesis of innocence. Rather, they need to be based only on rational inferences, from articulable facts, which reasonably suggest criminal activity.\u201d). Florida courts have emphasized that no single factor is dispositive to establish that an officer\u2019s suspicion leading to a Terry-stop is reasonable. Instead, the circumstances, as they are known to the officer at the time of the investigative stop, are viewed in their totality. Hernandez, 784 So.2d at 1128. Additionally, the officer\u2019s training and experience is taken into consideration to determine whether anything incongruous or unusual reasonably triggered the officer\u2019s suspicion to conduct a stop.

Other appellate courts have also concluded that transportation to and detention in a police station or other custodial setting constitutes a de facto arrest. See, e.g., United States v.

Consequently, we affirm the convictions. Affirmed. 1 . In ruling on the propriety of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, the appellate court considers the evidence introduced at the suppression hearing and at trial. See, e.g., Beasley v. Commonwealth, 60 Va.App. 381, 385 n.1, 728 S.E.2d 499, 501 n.1 (2012). The Court views that evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below, in this case the Commonwealth. E.g., id. 2 . As Land approached, the appellant \"jump[ed] out ... of the car.\u201d The officer \"instructed him to get back into the vehicle,\u201d and the appellant complied. 3 .

Such a claim, however, is foreclosed by the Supreme Court's decision in Horton v. California. See 496 U.S. at 138-42, 110 S.Ct. at 2308-11 (upholding the seizure of weapons used in an armed robbery, notwithstanding that, although the officer expected to find the weapons, his warrant application only listed the proceeds); see also United States v. Hill, 19 F.3d 984, 989 (5th Cir.1994). 4 . See Dickerson, 508 U.S. at 375, 113 S.Ct. at 2137 (indicating that the \u2018\u2018immediately apparent\u201d requirement is satisfied if the police have \"probable cause to believe that an object in plain view is contraband without conducting some further search of the object\u201d). 5 .

In Lalor, we concluded that a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence was not supported by probable cause. See 996 F.2d at 1583. In so doing, however, we distinguished Lalor\u2019s case from prior ones, including Suarez and Williams, wherein the nexus between criminal activity and the targeted premises was based on evidence of the suspect\u2019s drug traf ficking activities combined with the reasonable inference that drug-related evidence would be found in the suspect\u2019s home.

As used in this subsection, \u201chot pursuit\u201d means the immediate pursuit of a person who is endeavoring to avoid arrest. (Emphasis added.) [\u00b6 10] This Court has also recognized that city police officers have jurisdiction to stop vehicles and arrest individuals outside of their geographical jurisdiction when responding to requests from another law enforcement agency for aid and assistance.

Because the officer\u2019s identification of Appellant was predicated solely upon a vague racial description, we agree with Appellant that articulable and reasonable grounds for the stop did not exist. Consequently, the stop was invalid and all evidence flowing therefrom should have been suppressed as fruits of the unlawful stop. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 543 Pa. 612, 618-620, 673 A.2d 915, 918-919 (1996) (<HOLDING>); Commonwealth v.

In Portillo-Aguirre, this court held that where a border patrol agent has completed the immigration purpose of a stop, questioning that unduly prolongs the duration of the stop may be improper under the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Portillo-Aguirre, 311 F.3d at 657 (<HOLDING>). The district court\u2019s legal determination, holding that an officer has reasonable suspicion to conduct traffic stop even when his suspicion that a law has been violated is based on a reasonable mistake of lawrecognizing that police officer may stop a suspect if the officer has a reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afootholding that if an agent does not develop reasonable suspicion of criminal activity before the justifying purpose of a checkpoint stop has been accomplished he may not prolong the stopholding that reasonable suspicion is required to prolong a traffic stop after the purpose for which the investigatory stop was instituted has been accomplishedholding that an officer can stop an individual if the officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity is underfoot & \n\nsituation.\u201d Id. at 396-97.

In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him.

The defendant in Lewis was charged with the federal offense of possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony by a state court. He attempted to defend on the ground that he had been unconstitutionally denied the right to counsel in connection with the predicate felony conviction. The United States Supreme Court rejected Lewis\u2019s challenge, concluding that Congress had manifested no intent to permit collateral attacks upon prior state convictions in federal criminal proceedings. Id. at .60. The Court distinguished the status-offense statute in Lewis from cases that involved penalty-enhancement statutes where the sentence was overturned. See United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 447-49 (1972) (<HOLDING>); Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 115-16 (1967) holding that where a statute provides for an enhanced penalty based on a defendants prior conviction the fact of conviction is a sentencing factor to be determined by the court rather than a juryholding an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid because no prison term was imposed and the conviction may be used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent offenseholding that felony conviction for which imposition of sentence was stayed could be counted as prior felony conviction under sentencing guidelinesholding uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may be sentence enhancerholding that uncounseled conviction could not be considered by court in sentencing defendant after subsequent conviction & \n\nthe right to a jury trial. See, e.g., Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488, 495, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974) (classifying contempt to determine whether the contemnor enjoyed the right to a jury trial). In such cases, the Supreme Court has noted that \u201cthe severity of the penalty actually imposed is the best indication of the seriousness of a particular offense.\u201d Frank v. United States, 395 U.S. 147, 149, 89 S.Ct. 1503, 23 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969). The Court notes that the actual sentence imposed and the final guideline range are not the same; however, in this unusual context, the final guideline range is a closer benchmark to the sentence imposed than the offense guideline without the applicable adjustments. Cf. Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (<HOLDING>). If the Court adopts the latter approach of holding that a court of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to a withinguidelines sentenceholding a court of appeals may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper application of the sentencing guidelinesholding that district court may not presume reasonableness of guidelines sentencing range in particular caseholding that we may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the guidelines rangeholding that a court of appeals may presume reasonable a district courts proper application of the sentencing guidelines & \n\nKennedy). The judgment of conviction having been vacated, the present defendant is treated as a charged, not as a convicted child pornographer. The question now posed is whether the pretrial condition of curfew with electronic monitoring mandated by the Adam Walsh Act is unconstitutional as applied in view of this court\u2019s finding that electronic monitoring is not needed to avoid flight or any danger to children or to society. The answer: The Adam Walsh Act is unconstitutional as applied to this defendant under present circumstances. B. Constitutionality The Eighth Amendment provides \u201cexcessive bail shall not be required.\u201d U.S. amend. VII. This limit of federal authority applies to the states. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 2649, 171 L.Ed.2d 601 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

The central dispute in this appeal is the meaning of \u201capplicable to\u201d and \u201capplicable guidelines.\u201d The government contends that, in this case, the applicable guidelines are the Career Offender guidelines because Pleasant qualified as a Career Offender, even though he was not sentenced under those guidelines. Pleasant argues that, under Freeman, the applicable guideline is \u00a7 2D1.1 because the plea agreement called for sentencing to be imposed under that provision. The commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 addresses this very question. See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (<HOLDING>). Specifically, Application Note 1(A) clarifies holding that commentary is not authoritative if it is inconsistent with or a plainly erroneous reading of the guideline it interprets or explainsholding that commentary to the guidelines is treated as an agencys interpretation of its own legislative ruleholding that guidelines and commentary have force of law that may not be disregarded by sentencing judgeholding that commentary accompanying guidelines is bindingholding that guidelines commentary is generally authoritative & \n\nin confinement.\u201d 864 So.2d at 1121. See also Moore. We have held that a trial court does not have jurisdiction to split a 20-year sentence so that the defendant serves less than the mandatory minimum term of imprisonment. The State has established the prerequisites for the issuance of this writ of mandamus. For the foregoing reasons, this petition is due to be, and is hereby, granted. Judge McCormick is directed to resen-tence Gaines. As this Court ordered in Austin: \u201cBecause the 20-year sentence was valid, the circuit court may not change it. See Wood [v. State, 602 So.2d 1195 (Ala.Crim.App.1992)]. However, the court may split the sentence in compliance with \u00a7 15-18-8, i.e., with no more than 5 years in confinement, see, e.g., Soles v. State, 820 So.2d 163, 165 (Ala.Crim.App.2001) (<HOLDING>), or, it if determines that splitting the holding that the newly amended 15188 allows a trial judge to suspend a sentence imposed upon application of the schoolhousing enhancements despite the prohibition against probation in 13a12250 and 13a12270holding that probation is not a sentenceholding that upon revocation of probation a court must grant credit for time served on probation and community control towards any newly imposed term of imprisonment and probation so that the total period of control probation and imprisonment does not exceed the statutory maximumholding that where original sentencing judge imposed a guidelines sentence defendant could not be sentenced as a habitual offender upon violation of probationholding that judge found sentence enhancements mandatorily imposed under the guidelines that result in a sentence greater than that authorized by the jury verdict or facts admitted by the defendant violate the sixth amendments guarantee of the right to trial by jury & \n\nv. Ebbers, 458 F.3d 110, 128 (2d Cir.2006) ] strongly undermines that position. Moreover, we see no reason why considerations relevant to loss causation in a civil fraud case should not ollow the Second Circuit in expressly applying Dura Pharmaceuticals\u2019s civil principle to criminal securities fraud sentencing. We decline to do so for two reasons. First, we believe that the primary policy rationale of Dura Pharmaceuticals for proscribing overvaluation as a valid measure of loss does not apply in a criminal sanctions context. Second, application of Dura Pharmaceuticals\u2019s civil rule to criminal sentencing would clash with the parallel principles in the Sentencing Guidelines, which have persuasive value in federal courts. See United States v. Staten, 466 F.3d 708, 710 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). As noted, Dura Pha'rmaceuticals rejected the holding that alj committed reversible error in failing to consider whether a claimants failure to seek treatment was due to his financial circumstancesholding that it was reversible error for the trial court to consider cumulative error in assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counselholding that any error by a district court in applying a sentencing enhancement is harmless if it did not change a defendants total offense levelholding that failure to consider guidelines note in applying sentencing enhancement was reversible errorholding that the defendants substantial rights were not affected by a sentencing guidelines enhancement even in the absence of a specific finding by the district court because the evidence amply supported the enhancement & \n\nwe would not consider it binding, or even persuasive, in determining whether to grant a writ for habeas corpus. \u201cSection 2254(d) requires us to give state courts\u2019 opinions a respect ful reading, and to listen carefully to their conclusions, but when the state court addresses a legal question, it is the law \u2018as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u2019 that prevails.\u2019 \u201d Williams, 529 U.S. at 387, 120 S.Ct. at 1510. We find that the analysis set forth by Johnson is much more compelling. Because the 1997 Amendments do not impose a mandatory minimum sentence, see infra, petitioner\u2019s reliance on Smith is misplaced. Likewise, Meeks does not apply to this case, because it dealt with sentencing statutes and not parole guidelines. See generally Newland, 714 N.Y.S.2d at 631-32 (<HOLDING>). We agree that it is reasonable to interpret holding that an amendment passed two years into a 10year automatic extension period was not effective until the 10year extension period expired and stating that to hold otherwise would render the extension provision meaninglessholding that extension of a federal grand jurys term was within the discretionary powers of the district courtholding that the extension of meeks by the smith court was inappropriateholding that an amendment of restrictive covenants passed during the running of an automatic 10year extension period was not effective until the end of the 10year extension periodholding that a district court may not construe an untimely notice of appeal as a motion for extension of time & \n\nLagunas to at least ten years incarceration.\u201d Lagunas I, 214 Fed.Appx. at 845. Thereafter, the United States Sentencing Commission (Sentencing Commission) issued Amendment 706 which modified the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) downward two levels for crack cocaine, effective November 1, 2007, and retroactive as of March 3, 2008. In February 2008, Mr. Lagunas filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the changes in the Drug Quantity Table and the resulting two-level reduction in offense levels. See Lagunas II, 309 Fed.Appx. at 266.

V. Beazer challenges on two grounds the court\u2019s entry of judgment against it and in favor of Agrico on Agrico\u2019s equitable indemnification claim. First, Beazer contends that under controlling .South Carolina law, equitable indemnification lies only between parties having a contractual or special relationship that did not exist between Beazer and Agri-eo. Second, Beazer contends that equitable indemnity does not lie in favor of a party that itself is at fault in causing the injury for which indemnification is sought and that here Agrico was so at fault. We disagree on both points and find no error in this part of the court\u2019s judgment. Judgment was entered only for litigation costs incurred by Agrico in defending against Dent\u2019s 22, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1982) (<HOLDING>). Here, the jury, answering an interrogatory holding that an indemnitee must be proven to be free of negligence in order to receive indemnity either under a general indemnity agreement or under implied indemnityholding that a shoulder purse carried by a person at the time he is stopped lies within the scope of a warrant authorizing the search of his personrecognizing that the determination is an equitable oneholding that equitable indemnity lies where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he does not joinholding that duty not to cause injury to another by ones negligent act is too broad to serve as a basis for permitting indemnity & \n\nwe hold that it is not subject to an assertion of equitable estop-pel. As its name implies, equitable es-toppel embraces the notion that a party should not be permitted to profit by asserting rights against another when that party\u2019s own inequitable conduct has lulled the other into action or inaction detrimental to its position. See Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health & Rehab. Servs. v. S.A.P., 835 So.2d 1091, 1096-97 (Fla.2002) (citing State ex rel. Watson v. Gray, 48 So.2d 84, 87-88 (Fla.1950)). The doctrine has been most commonly held to preclude a defendant from raising a statute of limitations defense when the defendant\u2019s false representations mislead the plaintiff into failing to file suit within the limitations period. See Major League Baseball v. Morsani, 790 So.2d 1071, 1076 (Fla.2001) (<HOLDING>); Rinker Materials Corp. v.

The relatively few courts that have addressed whether equitable tolling may be applied to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(e)(1) are virtually unanimous in holding that it may not. E.g., Roost v. Reynolds (In re Reynolds), 189 B.R. 199 (Bankr.D.Or.1995); International State Bank v. Fresquez (In re Fresquez), 167 B.R. 973 (Bankr.D.N.M.1994); Malloy v.

Simple excusable neglect is not sufficient. Moreover, a petitioner must diligently pursue his federal habeas claims; a claim of insufficient access to relevant law, such as AEDPA, is not enough to support equitable tolling. Id. (internal citations omitted). Mr. Bisner has not shown that any of the three circumstances discussed in Gibson, or any similar circumstances, exist. And the reasons Mr. Bisner offers for equitable tolling are simply inadequate. See id. (<HOLDING>); Marsh v.

See Roberts Farms, 65 Retail Stores, Corp., 216 F.3d 882, 884-85 (9th Cir.2000). Additionally, the Court of Appeals further explained, While the doctrine of equitable mootness focuses on whether it is, for all practical purposes, impossible to award effective relief, other equitable considerations center on whether it would be unfair to grant the relief requested. Therefore, even if an appeal is not equitably moot, a court may still hold that the equities weigh in favor of dismissing the appeal. See, e.g., In re Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc., 44 F.3d 1310, 1320 (6th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Id. at 885. The first concept discussed above holding that an appeal was not equitably moot because the person who was issued the money was a party and was aware when the payment was made that the award would be appealedholding that the plaintiff had established an entitlement to relief on the merits of the claim and was therefore entitled to fees even though it was remanded to the agency for further actionholding that even though the appeal was not moot because effective relief was possible it was inequitable to require that the debtors counsel disgorge fees and costs awarded by the bankruptcy courtholding that an order to disgorge funds was final even though the order did not distribute the fundsholding that the case was not moot even though claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were no longer alive because the plaintiff had requested pecuniary relief & \n\nany officer of the state, or of a country, or of a city or other municipality, could follow them only when he saw fit. If by estoppel such salutary provisions, enacted with wise foresight as checks upon extravagance and dishonesty, can be utterly abrogated at will by any officer, such provisions then subserve no purpose, and the public corporation has no earthly protection against either greed or graft .... Equitable estoppel is impotent to purge transactions of the fatal infirmity of being in violation of law. Id.

To qualify for equitable tolling, a petitioner must first demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances caused his failure to timely file his petition. See Holland, 130 S.Ct. at 2562; LaCava v. Kyler, 398 F.3d 271, 276 (3d Cir.2005). Alicia allegedly suffered symptoms from a rota-tor cuff tear from March 1, 2007 to August 17, 2007. He contends he experienced persistent pain from his injury so that daily activities, such as feeding himself, were -painful. But his injury did not necessarily preclude opportunities to file, since prison officials or others could have assisted him in completing the forms. C.f. Arbas v. Nicholson, 403 F.3d 1379, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>).

The partial distribution may provide for a distributive award. Any such orders entered shall be taken into consideration at trial and proper credit given. Interim equitable distribution orders are by nature preliminary to entry of a final equitable distribution judgment and thus are interlocutory. See Veazey v.

In addition to the guidance provided by the Supreme Court, several circuits have allowed equitable tolling based on mental illness. The First Circuit has established that mental incapacity is a suitable basis upon which to equitably toll a statute of limitations. See Mel\u00e9ndez-Arroyo v. Cutler-Hammer de P.R., Co., 273 F.3d 30, 39 (1st Cir.2001) (remanding for factual inquiry into whether plaintiffs mental state warranted equitable tolling); Nunnally, 996 F.2d at 5 (<HOLDING>); Oropallo v.

Blake argues that because Farrington commissioned the Harrigan map, that map constituted a representation by Farrington. However, commissioning another to create a map is not in itself a representation for equitable estoppel purposes. Rather, a commissioned map or document constitutes a representation in equitable estoppel where a party uses the document to induce another party to act. See, e.g., Slagle v. United States, 809 F. Supp. 704, 710 (D. Minn. 1992) (<HOLDING>); cf. In re Tipton, 18 B.R. 803, 806-10 (Bankr. holding that the united states corps of engineers publication of maps of navigable waters did not constitute affirmative misconduct for equitable estoppel purposesholding that it was unreasonable for a party to rely on maps drafted by the united states corps of engineers that bore the heading waters covered by section 10 of the 1899 rivers and harbors act under the jurisdiction of the st paul district corps of engineers and the caption that all other waters and wetlands not shown on this map should be considered to be covered by section 404 of the 1972 act to determine whether bodies of water outside the scope of the map were considered navigableholding that the evident breadth of congressional coneern for protection of water quality and aquatic ecosystems supported the army corps of engineers interpretation of waters of the united states to encompass wetlands adjacent to waters as more conventionally definedholding that the land under navigable waters was not granted by the constitution to the united states but was reserved to the states respectively and that new states have the same rights jurisdiction and sovereignty over the soil under navigable water as the original statesrecognizing that the supreme court has indicated that affirmative misconduct is a prerequisite to a finding of estoppel against the united states & \n\nor a balance of the conveniences is on the party seeking to proceed with the second action.

Quoting the Supreme Court, the panel instructed that: [I]n cases of bankruptcy, many incidental questions arise in the course of administering the bankrupt estate, which would ordinarily be pure cases at law, and in respect of their facts triable by jury, but, as belonging to the bankruptcy proceedings, they become cases over which the bankruptcy court, which acts as a court of equity, exercises exclusive control.

First, RICO\u2019s statutory scheme resembles the EPCA more than the RCRA. Both RICO and the EPCA stand alone in grappling with a broad social issue, whereas the RCRA had a closely related statute on which the Court in Meghrig relied heavily.

Beyond Officer January\u2019s and Tichenor\u2019s testimony, the list goes on and on. III. Conclusion Sherman Lamont Fields was sentenced to death based on testimony that he was never able to confront. That is precisely the evil that the Confrontation Clause was meant to protect against. That troubling fact cannot be remedied by categorizing the testimony as speaking to selection as opposed to eligibility factors. The jury\u2019s difficulty in agreeing on a sentence and the number of mitigating factors found highlight how artificial that distinction can be. I would find that the Confrontation Clause applies to capital sentencing as it is structured under the FDPA and remand this case for resentencing. 1 . Compare Proffitt v.

This Court in Globe v. State, 877 So.2d 663 (Fla.2004), addressed a Confrontation Clause issue and held that the clause was not implicated where Globe and his codefendant, Busby, speaking together to a law enforcement officer, gave a joint taped statement in which they admitted killing a fellow inmate and where the tape was played at trial. The Court reasoned thusly: We have previously recognized that admissions by acquiescence or silence do not implicate the Confrontation Clause. See Nelson v. State, 748 So.2d 237 (Fla.1999); see also United States v. Kehoe, 310 F.3d 579, 590-91 (8th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1048, 123 S.Ct. 2112, holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were madeholding that an absent witnesss statements are admissible under the confrontation clause only where the declarant is unavailable and only where the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamineholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statementsholding that any confrontation right is found in the fourteenth amendments due process clause not the confrontation clause of the sixth amendmentholding that the confrontation clause did not guarantee the defendant the right to crossexamine a speaker whose statements were imputed to the defendant as adoptive admissions of a party opponent & \n\nthat the admission of Permanian\u2019s statements violated the holding in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). In Bruton, the Supreme Court held that the defendant was deprived of his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment when his codefendant\u2019s post-arrest confession, which incriminated the defendant, was admitted at their joint trial. In reaching its decision, the Court acknowledged that there was no recognized exception to the hearsay rule before it. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 128 n.3, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 480 n.3, 88 S. Ct. at statements admissible because there was sufficient indicia of reliability). Moreover, defendant was able to confront and cross-examine Rinaldi, who testified about the statements. See Ramey, 151 Ill. 2d at 528 (<HOLDING>); Goodman, 81 Ill. 2d at 284 (same).

Ibid. The Court further found that Holub had not been prejudiced by the delay and that the government had no history of delaying trials in that area. Id. at 30. For those reasons, the Court held that dismissal without prejudice was appropriate. Its holding is not an abuse of discretion. VII. Next, the defendants challenge their sentences on various grounds. One of Wiley\u2019s contentions\u2014that hearsay introduced at the sentencing hearing violated his right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment\u2014 was disposed of by our decision in United States v. Wise, 976 F.2d 393 (8th Cir.1992) (en banc) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 113 S.Ct. 1592, 123 holding that any confrontation right is found in the fourteenth amendments due process clause not the confrontation clause of the sixth amendmentholding that confrontation clause protections do not extend to sentencing hearingsholding that the confrontation clause applies only to trials and not to sentencing hearingsholding that the confrontation clause does not apply to the sentencing hearingholding confrontation clause inapplicable at sentencing & \n\n(finding objections on hearsay and foundational ground sufficient to preserve a Sixth Amendment claim for appeal because of the close relationship between hearsay and confrontation), aff'd 933 N.E.2d 1271 (Ind.2010). The best practice is for attorneys to make both objections when applicable. The failure to do so in this case is not particularly egregious; because the trial court concluded that the testimony was not hearsay, it seems unlikely that the trial court would have sustained an objection based on the Confrontation Clause. Regardless, we agree with the State that Officer Thompson\u2019s testimony was not \u201ctestimonial hearsay,\u201d the type of hearsay barred pursuant to the Confrontation Clause. See Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (<HOLDING>). Davis described the distinction between holding that the admission of testimonial statements against a defendant is unconstitutional when the declarant does not appear at trial unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for crossexaminationholding that the confrontation clause bars admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for crossexaminationholding that the admission of prior testimony that had been subjected to crossexamination violated the confrontation clause because the state did not prove that the witness was unavailableholding that outofcourt statements by witnesses that are testimonial in nature are barred under the confrontation clause unless witnesses are unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamine themholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statements & \n\n3553(e)[,] asserting the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance to the Government; or (2) the defendant meets the \u201csafety valve\u201d criteria set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).\u2019 Otherwise, post-Booker sentencing courts lack discretion to depart below relevant statutory m\u00ednimums.\u201d In this case, the gov 606, 2008 WL 946065 (5th Cir.2008) (noting that alleged violations of the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment are subject to harmless error analysis). 4 .

CPPA With respect to appellant\u2019s CPPA claims, this court has previously addressed the question whether the CPPA applies to landlord-tenant relations. See Gomez v. Independence Mgmt. of Delaware, Inc., 967 A.2d 1276, 1286 (D.C.2009) (<HOLDING>). In Gomez, we found that although the Council holding that apprendi does not apply retroactivelyholding that the cppa does not apply to landlordtenant relationsholding that the confrontation clause does not apply to the sentencing hearingholding that 1447c does not apply to counselholding that title ii does not apply to the states & \n\nin a lineup or photospread, but forgets, or changes, his testimony at trial.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., United States v.

The better course, obviously, is to provide the photo array or other evidence of the prior identification immediately, while the declarant is still on the witness stand. But events at trial sometimes make the better course impractical. In such circumstances, a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine a declarant regarding his prior identification is enough to satisfy the requirements of Rule 801, even if the defendant chooses not to use the opportunity. See United States v. Elemy, 656 F.2d 507, 508 (9th Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>). The district court provided Foster such a holding that the principal is liable for an agents acts committed within the scope of the agents employmentholding that fbi agents testimony regarding witnesss pri or identification was admissible where nothing in the record suggested that the declarant was unavailable for reexamination after the agents testimonyholding that agents testimony as to witnesss identification was not hearsayholding that an absent witnesss statements are admissible under the confrontation clause only where the declarant is unavailable and only where the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamineholding that the victims prior videotaped testimony from a preliminary hearing was admissible as testimony at trial where the victim was unavailable to testify & \n\nCourt subsequent to his trial. Effecting a significant change in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that in criminal prosecutions, unless a declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him, the Confrontation Clause forbids use against the defendant of the declarant\u2019s out-of-court testimonial statements admitted for their truth. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Government does not dispute that the pleas, allocutions, and post-arrest statement made at a proffer session constitute \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d of the sort barred by Crawford. We assume without deciding that this characterization is correct. Cf. United States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); see also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at holding that in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment based on a plea of guilty or no contest a defendant must bring forward a full statement of facts including a transcription of the plea proceedingsholding that a plea allocution is a testimonial statementholding that the defendant was entitled to have his plea accepted absent a sound reason for rejecting the pleaholding that plea of guilty or nolo contendere is not rendered involuntary because it is a product of plea bargaining an accepted plea bargain must be recorded and court may accept a bargained plea to a lesser offense reasonably related to a charged offenserecognizing that a voluntary and understanding guilty plea entered without the benefit of a plea bargain waives all nonjurisdictional defects that occurred before the entry of the plea & \n\nDefendants \u2014 making it a likelier reference to the other Defendants who were on trial. The Government notes that the Court in Gray suggested \u201c[m]e and a few other guys [beat the victim]\u201d as an alternative to the improper redaction in the phrase \u201c[m]e, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys [beat the victim].\u201d 523 U.S. at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151. But the language \u201ca few other guys\u201d is less specific than \u201cothers\u201d as stated at trial, especially when coupled with Alexander\u2019s identification of \u201cthe other individuals\u201d as the four other Defendants just a few minutes earlier in Hodous\u2019s testimony. Another issue implicates the Confrontation Clause. The analyses in Richardson, Gray, and Vasilakos assume the presence of a limiting instruction. See, e.g., Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (<HOLDING>). Here, no limiting instruction was given to holding that where a defendants name is replaced with a neutral pronoun as long as identification of the defendant is clear or inculpatory only by reference to evidence other than the redacted confession and a limiting instruction is given to the jury there is no bruton violationholding that when all references to the defendant in a eodefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the clause was not violated by a redacted confession with a proper limiting instructionholding that when all references to the defendant in a codefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the confession did not violate the confrontation clause because it was redacted to eliminate not only the defendants name but any reference to his or her existence & \n\nconsequences of his own wrongful acts. It grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated. Id. at 158. In other words, while the Constitution does grant a privilege of confronting ones accusers, that privilege is lost if the accuser causes the witness's unavailability at trial. \u00b6 40. Since the Reynolds decision, the Court has continued to acknowledge the concept that a defendant can forfeit through misconduct his or her confrontation rights. See, e.g., Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 451-53 (1912) (<HOLDING>); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106 holding that a hearsay statement can itself be considered in first determining if a conspiracy existed when the statement was madeholding that defendant who introduced hearsay statement waived objection to admission of another part of same statementholding that a defendant waives right to object to a hearsay statement on confrontation grounds when he or she offers the statementholding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding prior statement subject to crossexamination when made does not violate confrontation clause & \n\nthe reasonableness inquiry into his unavailability,\u201d the district court appropriately concluded that there was no Ninth Circuit precedent directly addressing the key issue raised in this appeal. V Several of our sister circuits, as well as a district court in our own circuit, have however, \u201caddressed the issue of whether the government\u2019s conduct in a case involving alien witnesses who subsequently left the United States was reasonable and in good faith.\u201d See, e.g., Wilson, 36 F.Supp.2d at 1181-82 (surveying cases from the First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Tenth Circuits, before concluding that the government has a duty to make reasonable and good faith efforts to procure the witness\u2019s attendance at trial before the witness leaves the United States); see also Mann, 590 F.2d at 368 (<HOLDING>); United States v. Guadian-Salazar, 824 F.2d holding that in order to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to call a witness to testify the claimant must allege 1 the identity of the potential witness 2 that the witness was available to testify at trial 3 the substance of the witnesss testimony and 4 an explanation of how the omission of the testimony prejudiced the caseholding that testimonial hearsay statements of a witness who does not appear at trial are inadmissible under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to crossexamine the witnessholding that the jury could have reasonably inferred the requisite intent to induce the witness to lie or testify falsely from the defendants statements to the witnessholding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that though the government acted reasonably and in good faith in trying to convince a witness to return to testify for trial the witness was not unavailable under rule 804a5 because the government made the witnesss departure from the country possible & \n\nof the number of officers present. Huether also has prior experience with law enforcement \u2014 he was arrested after being questioned by law enforcement in Montana. At a minimum, these factors sh cord here supports the district court\u2019s decision declining to suppress the evidence. Moreover, the record shows Huether, without hesitation, answered the questions relating to the materials in his computer. B. Confrontation Clause Huether contends the district court erred in admitting testimony from Agent Erickson, which repeated the conclusions of a report prepared by those at NCMEC, and testimony from Agent Helderop concerning the hard drives\u2019 and compact discs\u2019 origin. Huether did not raise this issue in the district court; accordingly, we re , 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2532, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (<HOLDING>). According to Huether, Agents Erickson\u2019s and holding that any confrontation right is found in the fourteenth amendments due process clause not the confrontation clause of the sixth amendmentholding forensic laboratory experts statement that substance was cocaine is testimonial for sixth amendment confrontation clause purposesholding that the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial hearsayholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statementsholding that bureau of criminal apprehension bca laboratory report identifying a substance as cocaine was testimonial and implicated defendants right to confrontation & \n\nRoberts but before Crawford, the Supreme Court expressly relied on Roberts. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule [Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) ] is firmly enough rooted in our jurisprudence that, under this Court\u2019s holding in Roberts, a court need not inde1 pendently inquire into the reliability of such statements.\u201d Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775. Brist is therefore correct that the Court has rejected Bour-jaily\u2019s underlying reasoning by now requiring courts to conduct a separate Confrontation Clause analysis for out-of-court \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, even when the statements at issue otherwise satisfy a firmly-rooted hearsay exception. See, e.g., Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2540, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (<HOLDING>); Davis v.

In Washington, the United States Supreme Court decided the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process was denied because the State arbitrarily denied him the right to have a witness testify who had relevant and material testimony. Id. See United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 872-73, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 3449-50, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) (the government may not deport witnesses who have material and relevant testimony); Fountaine v.

Defendant then filed a motion for mistrial pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1061 on the basis that the jury had heard extraneous informa tion in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial, it inquired of the prosecutors and defense counsel as to their wishes regarding the jury in the capital sentencing proceeding. The prosecutor expressed a willingness to replace juror eleven with an alternate juror for the capital sentencing proceeding. However, defense counsel argued that the trial court had err 9, 192 (1971) (<HOLDING>). In State v.

Murphy's driving record as maintained by the Secretary of State, as of this date. Although the last paragraph in the certificate referred to an attached copy of Murphy\u2019s driving record, no other document was attached to the certificate. However, a third exhibit, a copy of the letter entitled \u201cNotice of Suspension and Opportunity for Hearing\u201d was also admitted in evidence over Murphy\u2019s objection. 3 .

The statute does not restrict or modify the holding that a prosecutors questions eliciting testimony from a victim as to issue of virginity prior to the assault did not violate colorados rape shield statute because that statute does not specifically prohibit a victim from testifying as to a lack of prior sexual activity id at 1020holding admissible testimony of the victims daughter regarding a telephone call from the defendant to the victim hours before the victims death and the victims emotions following the telephone call where defendant claimed accidentholding that a victim impact aggravator was not unconstitutionally vague because it directed the jury to consider inter alia the effect of the crime on the victims familyholding statute does not preclude victims family from testifying as to the difficulties encountered by victim following accidentholding that before a defendant is entitled to introduce evidence of the victims character for violence there must be sufficient evidence to support a finding that the victim was the first aggressor and that once the defendant testified that he was attacked and cut by the victim without provocation before using the victims utility tool to stab the victim the defendant was clearly entitled to question the victim about past acts of violence reflected in court documents from the state of oregon & \n\n254 S.W.2d at 1011. Though DeToto\u2019s affidavit does not explicitly state that Roberts refused to provide an affidavit, we believe the affidavit implicitly makes this contention through DeToto\u2019s statement that he had spoken with Roberts and that Roberts had denied making the statements. 36 . Because we have found, based on the reasoning already discussed in this section, that appellant\u2019s affidavits are not deficient, we need not address whether appellant\u2019s affidavits are sufficient on some other basis.

Although neither party has moved for joinder, courts frequently do\u2014 and indeed should \u2014 consider the issue sua sponte because a primary purpose of Rule 19 is to protect the rights of an absentee party.

Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment.

The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nprocess to convict a defendant when he is legally incompetent. United States v.

(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a)). Of relevance here, when neither party to a criminal trial moves for a competency hearing, the district court shall order such a hearing on its own motion[ ] if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense. \u00a7 4241(a); see also Mason, 52 F.3d at 1289 (<HOLDING>). Whether such reasonable cause exists, holding that the existence of probable cause in a 1983 case is a jury questionrecognizing the existence of the special relationshiprecognizing the cause of actionrecognizing that the existence of reasonable cause requires the sua sponte ordering of a competency hearingrecognizing cause of action & \n\nin granting summary judgment in favor of the Newmont Defendants. Defendants also fail to establish that Plaintiffs could not have survived a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), nor do they present certain facts which would permit this Court to enter into a more detailed analysis of the law. Although Defendants do not adequately brief this Court with regard to whether or not the issue of law on which the state court granted summary judgment was \u201cwell-settled,\u201d the Court has considered the state court\u2019s opinion carefully. The decision primarily relies on a 1983 ease where a landowner-contractee was sued by an employee of the landowner\u2019s contractor while working on a job on the property. See Sierra Pacific Power Co. v. Rinehart, 665 P.2d 270, 99 Nev. 557 (<HOLDING>). This Court notes, however, that several recognizing duty of care owed by business invitor to inviteerecognizing that a construction contract implicitly imposes a duty on contractors to perform work according to the standard of due careholding that the citys acceptance or nonacceptance of the contractors work would have no bearing on the issue of the contractors liability since it was his primary and active negligence that created the dangerous situation and the citys negligence in failing to remedy the situation would be only secondaiy and passiveholding that a landowner owed no duty of care to a contractors employee in the situation posed by the partiesholding that a landowner may be liable for injuries to an independent contractors employee if the hazard ous condition was not open and obvious if the condition was not a necessary consequence of the construction and if the landowner maintained possession and control of the premises & \n\nrepresented by counsel, has now filed a pro se motion for class certification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 23.

Discussion Rule 23(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that parties seeking class certification demonstrate: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all parties is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims and defenses of the representative parties are typical of those of the class; and (4) the representative party or parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.

B. Motion for Reduction of Sentence Nancy Melody also appeals the district court\u2019s decision to deny her request for probation in lieu of incarceration. In her motion for reduction of sentence, Nancy Melody admitted that \u201cthe time for modifying [her] sentence under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure [had] ... elapsed_\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Hill, 826 F.2d 507, 507-08 (7th Cir.1987). Nevertheless, she asserted that the district court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3651 to suspend her sentence and impose probation prior to execution of her sentence. She then argued that her sentence was more severe than that imposed upon her husband and that dramatic changes in her circumstances had o h Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>).

The court will consider plaintiffs\u2019 second contention first. STANDARD The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not mention motions to reconsider. The Eighth Circuit has instructed courts to consider such motions either under Rule 59(e) or Rule 60(b). Sanders v. Clemco Indus., 862 F.2d 161, 168 (8th Cir.1988); see also Schoffstall v.

When considering a motion to dismiss, a court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept well-pleaded facts as true. Columbia Natural Resources Inc. v. Tatum, 58 F.3d 1101, 1109 (6th Cir.1995). Thus, a court may not grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based upon its disbelief of a complaint\u2019s factual allegations. Id. A court, however, need not accept as true conclusions of law or unwarranted factual inferences. Morgan v. Church\u2019s Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides that, \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud ..., the circumstances constituting fraud ... shall. be stated with particularity.\u201d See generally Begala v.

The Supreme Court recognizes that Federal holding title ix does not support an action against official in an individual capacityholding that in a bivens action service upon employee in his official capacity does not amount to service in his individual capacityholding that a claim for damages exists in an action to enforce title ixholding that a claim for retaliation does not lie under title ixholding that the doctrine of qualified immunity does not protect a government official who is sued in an official capacity under title vii because title vii does not impose personal liability & \n\n2013 WL 98059, at *1 (W.D.Ky. Jan. 7, 2013) (\u201cBased on the overwhelming precedent where federal courts sitting in diversity have applied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b) rather than state law to decide bifurcation issues\u2014many of which appear in the precise context presented in this case\u2014the Court cannot agree with the parties\u2019 assertions that Kentucky law governs and instead finds Rule 42(b) is the standard applicable here.\u201d). Federal law on bifurcation for bad faith claims against insurers does not support Arrowood\u2019s argument for separate trials. Federal courts sometimes bifurcate trials of underlying liability claims and bad faith claims, but only when the liability claims are still unresolved. See, e.g., Warren v. Federal Ins. Co., 358 Fed.Appx. 670, 676 (6th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). There is no pending contract claim here.

The civil action should also be stayed because Hoeffner, a criminal defendant, seeks discovery as a civil plaintiff.

Based upon our de novo review, we conclude that the rear-end collision instruction amounted to harmless error and that the sudden emergency jury instruction was correctly given. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred in granting the motion for new trial. See Lieberman v. Bliss-Doris Realty Associates, L.P., 819 A.2d 666, 673 (R.I.2003) (<HOLDING>).

I would hold that the fact that a State is a nonweighing State may make the possibility of harmful error less likely, but it does not excuse a reviewing court from ensuring that the error was in fact harmless. Our cases in this area do not require a different result. IV The Court reaches a somewhat similar conclusion. It, too, would abolish (or at least diminish the importance of) the weighing\/nonweighing distinction for purposes of harmless-error analysis. But then, surprisingly, it also diminishes the need to conduct any harmless-error review at all. If all the evidence was properly admitted and if the jury can use that evidence when it considers other aggravating factors, any error, the Court announces, must be harmless. See ante, at 220 (<HOLDING>). Common sense suggests, however, and this holding that resentencing hearing in capital case is not barred by double jeopardy when appeals court rejects sole aggravating factor found by sentencer failure of sentencer to find other alleged aggravating factors is not an acquittal of these factors for double jeopardy purposesholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave aggravating factors considerable weightholding that when one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances that underlie the invalidated aggravating factor areviewing court need not apply harmlesserror reviewholding that the grand jury need not find nonstatutory aggravating factorsholding that the death of a victim may not be considered an aggravating factor in a homicide sentencing & \n\nprior convictions, and that he initially lied to the police because he did not think that they would believe him due to these convictions. The defendant\u2019s defense to the charges was self-defense and his credibility was a critical aspect of the case. The jury was specifically instructed that in weighing the testimony of a witness, one of the factors they should consider was whether the witness had ever been convicted of a crime. Thus, the nature of the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, which would have included the fact that the defendant had never used a weapon, threatened, or harmed anyone during the commission of these felonies, was relevant, and therefore, the trial court erred in precluding the defendant\u2019s testimony. See Lawhorne, 500 So.2d at 522; Williams, 730 So.2d at 779 (<HOLDING>). The defendant also contends that the trial holding that it was error for the trial court to allow the state to question the confidential informant on direct examination about her lack of felony charges when there was no prior attack of the witnesss credibilityholding that stipulation of the appellants undisputed prior convictions was harmless error and reasoning that blakely v washington which does not require a jury determination of prior convictions provides implicit support for the conclusion that a harmless error analysis is appropriateholding that any error was harmless and thus not plain errorholding that it was not error for the court to give a substantive new instruction to the jury after deliberations began where the instruction was given in court with the defendant and his counsel presentholding that the trial courts error in not allowing defendant to testify on direct examination as to nature and circumstances of prior convictions was not harmless error where credibility of the defendant was critical to the deliberations of the jury & \n\nlearned intermediary defense. If there is no basis in the record for the instruction given, such error may raise a \u201csubstantial and ineradicable doubt as to whether the jury was properly guided in its deliberations,\u201d and reversal may be required.

Given the complete lack of evidence in the record to support the inclusion of the reasonable evidence standard in the instruction, we hold that the district court erred by inaccurately charging the jury on Armour\u2019s affirmative defense. Cf. Bank South Leasing, 778 F.2d at 706 (<HOLDING>). In some instances, even an inaccurate holding the trial court erred in not charging the jury that a defendant had the burden of proving the affirmative defense of comparative negligenceholding that the trial court plainly erred in failing to provide a specific unanimity instruction to the juryholding that the district court erred in failing to properly charge the jury on defendants affirmative defensesholding that trial court erred in rendering takenothing judgment notwithstanding jurys verdict in favor of plaintiff based on defendants properly preserved charge error and concluding that proper remedy was for trial court to grant new trial based on the charge errorholding that district court erred in failing to consider evidence of secondary considerations & \n\nhave held that, under these circumstances, the additional language of Jenkins\u2019 proposed instruction \u201cprevents] the jury from considering the forbidden defense of assumption of the risk while allowing it to make factual findings on the issue of comparative negligence.\u201d Gish, 890 F.2d at 993; see also Koshorek v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 318 F.2d 364, 369 (3rd Cir.1963). Because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that Jenkins was given a direct order, the district court\u2019s failure to give the proposed instruction was tantamount to reinstating the defense of assumption of risk. The district court\u2019s instruction allowed the jury to treat the employee\u2019s \u201cvoluntary, knowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition\u201d as contributory negligence.

Moreover, in light of the aggravating circumstances in this ease - the emotional harm to the victim, that the molestation occurred over a long period of time, the exploitation of children other than the victim, Liska\u2019s pri- or felony convictions for child molestation and motorcycle theft, and Liska\u2019s long history of taking pornographic pictures of nude boys - it is unlikely that Liska\u2019s attorney\u2019s failure to present additional mitigating evidence, if indeed there was any, was prejudicial. See Bonin v. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815, 836 (9th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); Pizzuto, 280 F.3d at 968-69 (holding that holding that apprendi does not apply to state capital sentencing schemes where judges are required to find certain aggravating circumstances before imposing a death sentenceholding that the cause and prejudice standard applied to defendants failure to object to his career offender classification at sentencingholding that prejudice was not shown where there was overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that where the aggravating circumstances are overwhelming it is particularly difficult to show prejudice at sentencing due to the alleged failure to present mitigation evidencerecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\nalso provided that \u201cin order to convict of manslaughter by intentional act, it is not neces sary for [the] State to prove that the defendant had a premeditated intent to cause death.\u201d This instruction did not require the jury to find that Mr. Jasper intended to kill the victim.

Lockhart v. List, 542 Pa. 141, 148, 665 A.2d 1176, 1179 (1995) (<HOLDING>). \u00b6 12 For all of the foregoing reasons, I holding that unless an erroneous instruction was unlikely to have changed the result of the trial a reviewing court cannot say that giving the instruction was harmless errorholding that in reviewing a jury instruction this court must review the entire instruction and look at all the evidence on the record to determine whether there was error and whether that error prejudiced the complaining partyholding that when no objection was made to jury instruction evidence to support finding based on instruction should be assessed in light of the instruction givenholding that it was not error for the court to give a substantive new instruction to the jury after deliberations began where the instruction was given in court with the defendant and his counsel presentholding that a court reviewing an informal adjudication must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment & \n\nnot testify as a nonexpert fact witness about what he did and directly observed during the reenactment. Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\ntell the jury to disregard the accomplice\u2019s testimony, See 10 Minnesota Practice, CRIMJIG 3.18, it does require that corroborating evidence \u201caffirm the truth of the accomplice\u2019s testimony and point to the guilt of the defendant in some substantial degree.\u201d Sorg, 275 Minn. at 5, 144 N.W.2d at 786. First, we consider that the requirement for the instruction is based on the fact that the \u201ccredibility of an accomplice in inherently untrustworthy.\u201d Lee, 683 N.W.2d at 316. Chapman agreed to cooperate with officers and do a controlled buy in order to avoid criminal charges and jail. Therefore, it is relevant that Chapman was afforded leniency in exchange for his cooperation because he could have been charged with possession or second-degree manslaughter. See Rodriguez, 2007 WL 1412880, at *2 (<HOLDING>). Second, the prosecutor relied heavily on holding that seconddegree manslaughter was not a crime of violence and thus was not an aggravated felony warranting an aliens removalholding on rehearing that the interests of justice would be better served by remanding for new trial on the offenses of seconddegree murder and voluntary manslaughterholding that the lower court properly charged the jury on voluntary manslaughter where defendant testified he was in fear of the threat of physical assaultholding that erroneous manslaughter instruction that defendant intentionally caused the death of the victim did not constitute fundamental error certifying question if a jury returns a verdict finding a defendant guilty of seconddegree murder in a case where the evidence does not support a theory of culpable negligence does a trial court commit fundamental error by giving a flawed manslaughter by act instruction when it also gives an instruction on manslaughter by culpable negligenceholding that drug user was properly charged with seconddegree manslaughter after he cooked a lethal dose of heroin for the victim & \n\nas to whether this error resulted in egregious harm under Almanza. See Trejo, 280 S.W.Bd at 261. The author of the concurring opinion in Teal expressly distinguished the situation in the case at hand from the situation in Teal. See Teal, 230 S.W.3d at 183-84. Therefore, the concurring opinion in Teal does not support the State\u2019s argument that the charge error in this case did not result in egregious harm. We do not find any other information revealed by the record relevant to the egregious-harm analysis. Conclusion Having considered the factors set forth in Almanza, we hold appellant was egregiously harmed by the trial court\u2019s submission of a charge authorizing the jury to convict appellant for an unindicted offense. See Daniels v. State, 754 S.W.2d 214, 222-23 (Tex.Crim.App.1988) (<HOLDING>); Woodard, 300 S.W.3d at 410-12 (same as holding that error in omitting requisite mental state from application paragraph of charge did not result in egregious harmholding that charge error that allowed jury to convict appellant for an unindicted offense caused egregious harmholding jury charge error consisting of disjunctive submission of three separate sexual assault offenses without unanimity instruction caused egregious harm to defendantholding egregious harm standard applied where appellant failed to object to lack of instruction on accomplice witness testimonyholding charge error which authorized jury to convict without finding every requisite element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt was egregious based on the entirety of the charge the contested evidence and the arguments of counsel & \n\nlittle mitigating weight in tijis case. \u00b6 47 Appellant further contends the trial court erred when it failed to regard the giving of a felony murder instruction at trial as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance. We disagree. This court has held that a felony murder instruction \u201cmay be mitigating where there is some doubt as to a defendant\u2019s specific intent to' kill.\u201d State v. Henry, 189 Ariz. 542, 552, 944 P.2d 57, 67 (1997). Appellant\u2019s actions in savagely beating and strangling the victim to death, however, undermine any argument that he did not intend to kill the victim. Moreover, the jurors unanimously found Appellant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder as well as felony murder, indicating that they found\" intent to kill. See Atwood, 171 Ariz. at 648-49, 832 P.2d at 665-66 (<HOLDING>). We therefore conclude that the giving of a holding that when the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of premeditated and felony murder a jury instruction on unanimity is irrelevantholding that reversal of conviction for felony murder was required where jury failed to find the defendant guilty of the underlying felony as essential element of the felony murder offenseholding that where both firstdegree and felony murder were possible bases for a murder conviction a jury instruction that suggested the jury could rely on felony murder as the predicate offense for a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder was improper because under arizona law a conviction for conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder requires a specific intent to killholding that the eighth amendment requires finding that a felony murder defendant killed or attempted to killholding that the giving of a felony murder instruction is not a relevant mitigating circumstance when the defendant acted alone to kill the victim & \n\nthat? (Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter. See Benefield v. State, 904 N.E.2d 239, 247 n. 4 (Ind.Ct.App.2009) (<HOLDING>), trans. denied. There was no prose-cutorial holding almost any improper argument may be cured by an instruction to disregardholding improper admission of extrinsic evidence may be cured by adequate limiting instructionholding an error re garding the element of a crime may be cured through further instruction to the juryholding that a jury instruction directing the verdict on one element deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination on every element of the charged offense and thus constituted structural errorholding omission in the jury instruction of element of offense requires a new trial & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa. R.A.P. 302(a), \u201c[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Edmondson, 553 Pa. 160, 718 A.2d 751, 753 (1998); Commonwealth v. Dennis, 548 Pa. 116, 695 A.2d 409, 411 (1997) (\u201c[I]f appellate courts were to consider issues not raised in the trial court, then the trial would become a dress rehearsal ....\u201d) (citing Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Company, 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114, 116 (1974)); Commonwealth v. Jones, 248 Pa.Super. 214, 375 A.2d 63, 65-66 (1977) (<HOLDING>). Because appellant did not preserve the issue holding that the failure to object to a trial courts instruction constitutes waiverholding that plaintiffs failure to object to the improper comments of defendant during closing arguments resulted in waiver of plaintiffs right to argue the issue on appeal because the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issueholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that failure to object to trial courts refusal of further instruction to jury during deliberation results in waiver of issue on appealholding failure to object in timely fashion at trial results in waiver of issue for appeal & \n\nlawful arrest. Regarding the \u00a7 1983 claim, they were instructed that appellant had to establish that the officers used \u201cexcessive and unnecessary force to arrest him and hold him thereafter.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict can be reconciled only if a distinction can be made between unreasonable force and excessive or unnecessary force. Although appellant argues that the jury could have found a \u00a7 1983 violation based on the denial of medical assistance, the jury was not instructed on this theory, nor was it argued by appellant\u2019s counsel, and appellant did not object to the lack of such an instruction. Similarly, there was no instruction on negligent misuse of authorized force, nor any claim that the officers\u2019 actions were other than intentional. Cf. Wilson v. Beebe, 743 F.2d 342, 350 (6th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>). A jury\u2019s answers in a special verdict should holding an agents false statements reckless because she was aware of the true facts surrounding the suspects arrestholding a suspects request for some time to think alone was not an invocation of the right to silenceholding that a suspects ability to proffer an innocent explanation for the facts does not negate probable causeholding cocked pistol to suspects head showed reckless disregard for suspects rightsholding that an officer may search a suspects vehicle incident to a lawful arrest & \n\nthat overall lessen the State\u2019s burden of proof violate due process. B. Medina contends that the instruction improperly diminished the State\u2019s burden of proof. When explaining reasonable doubt to the jury, the trial court stated: \u201cwhen we talk about a reasonable doubt we mean doubt from which a reason can be given, a doubt which arises from a fair and rational consideration of the evidence or perhaps the lack of evidence, it means a doubt as would cause a man of ordinary prudence to pause or hesitate when called upon to act in the most important aspects of life.\u201d This portion of the charge was incorrect. It erroneously implies that the jury must find an articulable reason to support its doubts about the State\u2019s case. See State v. Vaszorich, 13 N.J. 99, 115, 98 A.2d 299 (1953) (<HOLDING>). Jurors may harbor a valid reasonable doubt holding that a court must allow the defendant to ask in voir dire whether a potential juror would automatically impose the death penalty and suggesting that such a juror should be disqualified for causeholding that trial courts denial of motion for new trial based on juror misconduct was justified where there was no evidence presented at hearing on motion that juror had knowingly concealed relevant litigation experience during voir dire and identity of juror as county court litigant was not demonstratedholding that the statement contained in a juror pamphlet that a reasonable doubt is one for which should he be called upon a juror can give a reason was obviously erroneous under our lawholding that though judge did not question juror individually note from juror to judge requesting private meeting to ask legal question did not suggest juror would not base verdict on evidenceholding phone call to defendant from purported juror saying we were pressured into making our decision inadequate to permit juror interview & \n\nin their closing arguments and may advance all legitimate arguments and draw logical inferences from the evidence. See McArthur, 801 So.2d at 1039^40. Moreover, prosecutors in specific are not limited to a robotic presentation on behalf of the State. See Diaz v. State, 797 So.2d 1286, 1287 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). However, \u201c[a] criminal trial is a neutral arena wherein both sides place evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration; the role of counsel in clos ing argument is to assist the jury in analyzing that evidence, not to obscure the jury\u2019s view with personal opinion, emotion, and nonrecord evidence.\u201d Ruiz, 743 So.2d at 4. Unfortunately, prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument is neither a new nor fading phenomenon. See, e.g., Crew v. State, 146 So.3d 101, 111 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014) (<HOLDING>); Freeman v. State, 717 So.2d 105, 106 (Fla. holding that the cumulative effect of the prosecutors comments which as seen above are welldocumented errors denied appellant a fair trialholding that cumulative effect of multiple errors worked to deprive defendant of fair trial although some errors standing alone would be subject to plain error review and others might be harmlessholding that although neither of the trial courts errors when considered in isolation were necessarily sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial the cumulative effect of the errors created sufficient prejudice to deny defendant a fair trialholding that plain error is the appropriate standard of review when a defendant objects to a prosecutors comments at trial does not move for a mistrial and then on appeal argues that the comments deprived him of a fair trialholding that a number of errors may be deemed harmful in their cumulative effect & \n\n"}

Appellant Kenneth Dana Brewton, by and through his counsel David L. Dunagin, moves this court for leave to file a belated brief. Brewton\u2019s brief was due in this court on October 14, 2008. After no brief was filed, the State filed a motion to dismiss on December 8, 2008. Thereafter, Brewton tendered his brief and filed the instant motion requesting to file the belated brief. We will accept a criminal appellant\u2019s belated brief to prevent an appeal from being aborted. See Brown v. State, 373 Ark. 453, 284 S.W.3d 481 (2008) (per cu-riam). However, good cause must be shown to grant the motion. See Strom v. State, 356 Ark. 224, 147 S.W.3d 689 (2004) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Here, Brewton accepts full responsibility and holding that failure to brief an argument constitutes waiverholding an appellate brief may serve as a notice of appealholding issues not raised in appellate brief are waivedholding failure to brief argument constitutes waiverholding that appellate counsels admitted failure to timely file the brief constituted good cause to grant motion for belated brief & \n\nthe sentence entered by the trial court is illegal and must be set aside.\u201d 12 S.W.3d at 800 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). We determined that, [o]n remand, the trial court may impose a sentence that is mutually agreeable to the State and appellant, so long as the sentence is available under the 1989 Act. If an agreement is not reached, though, appellant may withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial on the original charges. Id. Thus, McLaney and McConnell stand for the proposition that, when a defendant bargains for and receives an illegal sentence, the defendant will have the option of resentencing on the original plea or withdrawal of the plea and recommencement of the prosecution. See also Henderson v. State ex rel. Lance, 220 Tenn. 520, 419 S.W.2d 176, 178-79 (1967) (<HOLDING>).

I agree with the majority that subpart (b) of Rule 4-326 applies, and so there must be \u201cgood cause\u201d to exclude particular evidence from the jury room. See Majority Op. at 599-602, 4 A.3d 507-09. But videotapes are a special kind of evidence, and certainly replaying one in the jury room runs the risk of overemphasis. See Wright, 72 Md.App. at 218, 528 A.2d at 500; see also Brooks v. Holtz, 661 N.W.2d 526, 532 (Iowa 2003) (<HOLDING>); State v.

For that reason, appellant\u2019s fourth issue cannot be sustained. Therefore, we overrule appellant's fourth issue. 4 . Bell and Baptist assert relevant questions which a jury would have to consider and would necessitate an expert's opinion: for example, (1) whether the decision to use an arterial line was within the appropriate standard of care; (2)what are the appropriate procedures for an arterial line insertion; (3) what other possible medical causes could exist; (4) what should have been the appropriate medical treatment or intervention? See Haddock, 793 S.W.2d at 953 (<HOLDING>); Odak, 934 S.W.2d at 873 (holding that the holding that affidavit of merit is not required in common knowledge casesrecognizing common knowledge exceptionrecognizing a common knowledge exceptionholding that administering of a hypodermic needle for the purpose of anesthesia was not within laymans common knowledgeholding that a reason to combine may come from the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art the nature of the problem to be solved or common knowledge and common sense & \n\n859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir.1988). When considering a motion to dismiss, a court must construe the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept well-pleaded facts as true. Columbia Natural Resources Inc. v. Tatum, 58 F.3d 1101, 1109 (6th Cir.1995). Thus, a court may not grant a Rule 12(b)(6) motion based upon its disbelief of a complaint\u2019s factual allegations. Id. A court, however, need not accept as true conclusions of law or unwarranted factual inferences. Morgan v. Church\u2019s Fried Chicken, 829 F.2d 10, 12 (6th Cir.1987). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides that, \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud ..., the circumstances constituting fraud ... shall. be stated with particularity.\u201d See generally Begala v.

Effecting a significant change in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that in criminal prosecutions, unless a declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him, the Confrontation Clause forbids use against the defendant of the declarant\u2019s out-of-court testimonial statements admitted for their truth. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Government does not dispute that the pleas, allocutions, and post-arrest statement made at a proffer session constitute \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d of the sort barred by Crawford. We assume without deciding that this characterization is correct. Cf. United States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); see also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at holding that in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment based on a plea of guilty or no contest a defendant must bring forward a full statement of facts including a transcription of the plea proceedingsholding that a plea allocution is a testimonial statementholding that the defendant was entitled to have his plea accepted absent a sound reason for rejecting the pleaholding that plea of guilty or nolo contendere is not rendered involuntary because it is a product of plea bargaining an accepted plea bargain must be recorded and court may accept a bargained plea to a lesser offense reasonably related to a charged offenserecognizing that a voluntary and understanding guilty plea entered without the benefit of a plea bargain waives all nonjurisdictional defects that occurred before the entry of the plea & \n\nchallenge a vehicle search from passenger standing to seek suppression of evidence discovered in a vehicle as the fruit of an unlawful stop, detention, or arrest.\u201d). Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Because there is no evidence in this case holding that plain error review is appropriate unless there is some evidence that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of a particular argumentholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nand acceptance of responsibility as mitigating factors. See Sensback, 720 N.E.2d at 1164-1165. 2. Lack of Criminal History Page argues that the trial court gave no weight to his lack of criminal history. We disagree. The trial court recognized Page\u2019s lack of criminal history as a miti-gator but discounted the value of this miti-gator. Specifically, the trial court stated, \u201cThe court finds as mitigating circumstances that he has some criminal history, arguably it\u2019s not significant, but a weapons charge and another pending crime of violence along with these three crimes of violence, I don\u2019t think the mitigators are worth much.\u201d Transcript at 34. Page asks us to review the weight given to this mitigating factor for abuse of discretion, which we cannot do. See Anglemyer, 868 N.E.2d at 491 (<HOLDING>). B. Aggravators Page appears to argue that the holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave aggravating factors considerable weightholding that the relative weight or value assignable to aggravating and mitigating factors properly found is not subject to review for abuse of discretionholding that a trial courts weighing of mitigating and aggravating factors will not be disturbed absent a showing that the trial court abused its discretionholding that trial court retains wide discretion to apply or reject mitigating and aggravating factors as well as to interpret meaning of individual factors and its determination must be upheld absent abuse of discretionholding imposition of the death penalty proportionate where the trial court found two aggravating circumstances ccp and contemporaneous murder two statutory mitigating factors and a number of nonstatutory mitigating factors & \n\nfor the writ of mandamus. C. Violation of Due Process Appellant next contends that the trial court erred in finding that his due process rights had not been violated. The trial court stated that \" [procedural due process constrains government decisions which deprive an individual of some 'property' or 'liberty' interest. . .. petitioner has neither shown the existence of a property interest nor that his property has been taken.\" Order Den. Mot. for Recons, at 2 (Trial Div. Aug. 25, 1993). Appellant claims that his property interest lies in the 2% annual income tax he pays as an employee of the government. Appellant's argument is wrongly constructed, however. He does not challenge the ability of the Legislature to tax him and spend the money as part of the general fund. Ra 1983) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the mere fact that Appellant has holding that alleged violations of a state statute did not give rise to federal constitutional claimsholding that unilateral expectation of continued service at a particular stateoperated leprosy hospital did not give rise to a due process claimholding that a property interest sufficient to support a due process claim requires a binding assurance and not a mere unilateral expectationholding such service satisfies due processholding that a state agencys violations of its own internal regulations did not establish a due process violation or otherwise give rise to a constitutional claim & \n\nis an essential component of the administration of justice. Properly administered, it is to be encouraged. If every criminal charge were subjected to a full-scale trial, the States and the Federal Government would need to multiply by many times the number of judges and court facilities.\u201d); People v. Selikoff, 35 N.Y.2d 227, 360 N.Y.S.2d 623, 318 N.E.2d 784, 788 (1974) (\u201c[Plea negotiations] are essential to relieve court calendar congestion and they relieve the prosecution and defense from the risks and uncertainties of trial.\u201d) 4. Modern Acceptance (1970s-Today) Today, approximately ninety-four percent of all state convictions and ninety-seven percent of all federal convictions are resolved by plea bargaining. See Missouri v. Frye, \u2014 U.S, -, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1407, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012) (<HOLDING>). Plea bargaining has become a reflexive holding failure of prosecution to disclose evidence that may be favorable to the accused is a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendmentholding that defense counsel had duty to communicate formal offer from the prosecution to accept a plea on terms and conditions that may be favorable to the accusedholding that defense counsel has the duty to communicate formal offers from the prosecutionholding that to demonstrate prejudice resulting from counsels deficient performance that caused a defendant to forgo a favorable plea offer a defendant must show that he would have accepted the offer to plead and that there is a reasonable probability neither the prosecution nor the trial court would have prevented the offer from being accepted or implementedholding that the prosecution must disclose evidence favorable to the accused that is material either to guilt or to punishment & \n\nand circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the guideline imprisonment range, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), and (6). In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasoning behind its choice of sentence, this Court has held that the district court need not discuss, or state that it has explicitly considered, each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). Talley, 431 F.3d at 786. Instead, this Court has held that an explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005); see also Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (<HOLDING>). Here, the district court imposed a holding unconstitutional defendants sentence of death based upon the holding in roper supra and remanding for the montgomery circuit court to set aside the defendants death sentence and to sentence him to the only other sentence available life in the penitentiary without the possibility of paroleholding that the defendants sentence was reasonable when the district court considered the parties arguments and provided a reasoned basis for its choice of sentenceholding that a sentencing judge who had listened to the defendants arguments in support of a belowguidelines sentence provided sufficient explanation for rejecting those arguments when he found that the defendants circumstances were insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the guidelines rangeholding that a sentence imposed for a violation of supervised release will be upheld where 1 the district court considered the applicable policy statements 2 the sentence is within the statutory maximum and 3 the sentence is reasonableholding that the district court which had considered the guidelines but found an upward variant sentence necessary given the defendants previous violations did not abuse its discretion when it imposed a 24month sentence instead of a guidelines range sentence of 3 to 9 months incarceration & \n\nUnited States or of the state ... may commence a proceeding to secure relief by filing a petition in the district court in the county in which the conviction was had to vacate and set aside the judgment.... Minn.Stat. \u00a7 590.01, subd. 1 (2008). The term \u201ccrime\u201d was, and still is, defined as \u201cconduct which is prohibited by statute and for which the actor may be sentenced to imprisonment, with or without a fine.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.02, subd. 1 (2008). A misdemeanor is \u201ca crime for which a sentence of not more than 90 days or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both, may be imposed.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 609.02, subd. 3. We have rejected indefensible divisions between felonies, gross misdemeanor, and misdemeanor cases in the past. See State v. Borst, 278 Minn. 388, 396-97, 154 N.W.2d 888, 893 (1967) (<HOLDING>). Labeling the offense a felony or misdemeanor holding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding pursuant to courts inherent supervisory power over courts that counsel with concurrent prosecutorial obligations may not be appointed to defend indigent personsholding in situation of appointed counsel that if nonfrivolous issues may exist new counsel must be appointedrecognizing the supervisory power of appellate courtsholding based on our supervisory power over the administration of justice that indigent defendants including those charged with misdemeanors were entitled to appointed counsel at trial if they faced incarceration for their crimes & \n\nand Key were unreliable because they were not asked to identify him in a photographic lineup before trial and their testimony about the appearance of the surviving assailant differed to some extent. However, Appellant did not object to the admission of this eyewitness identification evidence at trial. See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196-201 (93 SCt 375, 34 LE2d 401) (1972) (discussing the due process protection against the admission of evidence deriving from suggestive identification procedures). And it is firmly established that the determination of a witness\u2019s credibility, including eyewitness identification, is within the exclusive province of the jury. See Reeves v. State, 288 Ga. 545, 546 (705 SE2d 159) (2011). See also Walker v. State, 295 Ga. 688, 690 (763 SE2d 704) (2014) (<HOLDING>); Vega v. State, 285 Ga. 32, 33 (673 SE2d 223) holding a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have beenholding that expert testimony should not be admitted as to a matter that is obviously within the common knowledge of jurors because such testimony almost by definition can be of no assistanceholding that because the special master saw the witnesses and heard the testimony he has broad discretion in determining credibilityholding that a trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to exclude testimony of a witness for an alleged sequestration violation where no impermissible harmonization of testimony could be inferred from the witnesss reading of the newspaper in the absence of any evidence that this testimony was based on what he readholding that whether and to what extent a witnesss testimony should be believed is a matter to be decided by the jury that saw and heard the testimony not by an appellate court reviewing a transcript & \n\nfactors, the Burnet court relied on Snedigar, which had in turn relied on Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. 223. The Snedigar court\u2019s holding (with the Burnet court\u2019s deletions italicized) is as follows: We . . . hold that when a trial judge chooses one of the harsher remedies allowable under CR 37(b), the reasons for that choice should he clearly stated on the record. We further hold that when the most severe sanction of default or dismissal is ordered, it must be apparent from the record that the trial court explicitly considered whether a lesser sanction would probably have sufficed, and whether it found the Associated Mortgage due process factors [of willfulness and substantial prejudice] to be present. 53 Wn. App. at 487 (emphasis added); Associated Mortgage, 15 Wn. App. at 228-29 (<HOLDING>). The Burnet court also cited a line of cases holding that a trial court had the authority to impose a default judgment as a sanction for violating a rule 16 scheduling order pursuant to rule 37b2 stating we agree with the basic premise that a default sanction can under certain circumstances be an appropriate response to a violation of a rule 16 order after all the express terms of rule 37 permit a trial court to impose sanctions when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discoveryholding that district courts order granting motion for default judgment was erroneous because a default judgment cannot be entered until the amount of damages has been ascertained holding that a postjudgment contempt sanction for refusal to obey orders whether it is characterized as a civil or a criminal sanction is immediately appealable as a final order under 1291recognizing that courts have discretion to exclude evidence as a sanction for violation of a discovery orderholding that the sanction of a default judgment authorized by cr 37b2c is a harsh remedy which should only be granted where there has been a willful or deliberate refusal to obey a discovery order which refusal substantially prejudices the opponents ability to prepare for trial & \n\nto counsel. Of course, it could be said that Clark can hardly complain about the district court\u2019s grant of his own motion. But, because the court\u2019s discretion to deny a request for self-representation requires the court to consider the defendant\u2019s interest, I would conclude that a defendant who makes such a motion, against the advice of or without the support of his appointed counsel ke a searching inquiry of Clark\u2019s reasons for wanting to dismiss his present counsel. , On their face, Clark\u2019s claims that counsel had not visited him in jail, had not discussed the case with him, would not seek out suggested witnesses, and would not have the gun checked for fingerprints, raised serious questions that required inquiry. See, e.g., United States v. Morrissey, 461 F.2d 666, 669 (2d Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The majority suggests that Clark\u2019s claims do holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to substitute counsel on the strength of gonzalezs sworn responses at the pleataking that no one was threatening him or forcing him to plead where the defendant alleged that his attorney forced him to plead guilty and threatened him if he did not take the pleaholding even when a request for an attorney is ambiguous it is incumbent upon law enforcement to seek clarification of the ambiguity before denying the statutory right to counselholding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding that an ambiguous mention of an attorney is not a request for counselholding that a defendants claim that his attorney did not meet with him or seek out witnesses required a searching inquiry before denying the request for new counsel & \n\nrelationships with our sister states and \u201cdoing justice in order that justice may be done in return,\u201d accept jurisdiction of Defendants\u2019 appeal pursuant to the authority conferred by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 l-277(a) and 7A-27(d). Notably, Defendants also contend that their appeal to this Court is permitted by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 l-277(b), which provides that \u201c[a]ny interested party shall have the right of immediate appeal from an adverse ruling as to the jurisdiction of the court over the person or property of the defendant.\u201d Thus, because the order being appealed from denied Defendants\u2019 12(b)(2) motion, Defendants contend that this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal under \u00a7 l-277(b). See Data Gen. Corp. v. Cnty. of Durham, 143 N.C. App. 97, 99-100, 545 S.E.2d 243, 245-46 (2001) (<HOLDING>). However, while \u201c[a] motion to dismiss based holding that the denial of a motion to remand is interlocutory and not immediately appealableholding a decision denying a motion to dismiss an action for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction is not appealableholding that denial of counsel in section 1983 action is not immediately appealableholding that a denial of a 12b2 motion for lack of personal jurisdiction on the ground of sovereign immunity is immediately appealableholding if immunity is raised as a basis in the motion for summary adjudication a substantial right is affected and the denial is immediately appealable & \n\nthe plaintiff was financially able to retain an attorney this was a \"special circumstance\u201d that would allow the court to deny it an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court remanded the matter with some instructions. On remand the Chancery Court determined that the ability to pay attorney\u2019s fees was not an appropriate special circumstance; thus, Wilmington Materials was entitled to and awarded attorney's fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988. 17 .2000 WL 1724326, 2000 Del. Ch. Lexis 168. 18 . The court determined that Wilmington Materials had a vested right to utilize the property because it had \"incurred expenses in reasonable reliance of its belief that the Code permitted its intended use.\u201d Wilmington Materials I, 1993 WL 280411 at *2, 1993 Del. Ch. Lexis 145. 19 . Id. 20 . Id. (<HOLDING>); and Wilmington Materials II, 1994 WL 384458, holding that an award of attorneys fees under supreme court rule 38 precursor to rule 222 did not preempt an award of attorneys fees to which one is otherwise entitled and thus appellant could seek an award of attorneys fees pursuant to section 1577300 which permits an award of fees for a party prevailing in an action against a state agencyholding that although plaintiff was entitled to fees under 1988 there were special circumstances which allowed the chancellor in his discretion to deny an awardholding that a pro se litigant who is an attorney is not entitled to fees under 1988holding that under 42 usc 1988 which allows the award of attorneys fees in a civil rights action under 1983 a prevailing plaintiff should ordinarily recover an attorneys fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust quoting srep no 941011 p 4 1976holding that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny an award of attorneys fees to the wife & \n\n(7)(f) or other discovery under N.D.R.Crim.P. 16, but the defendant is not under obligation to do so. The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v. Anderson, 303 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1981) (<HOLDING>). The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\noverturned unless no reasonable juror could have found that the govern ment disproved either element of entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. United States v. Jones, 976 F.2d 176, 180 (4th Cir.1992). In this case, the Government produced evidence that undercut at least the element of predisposition. Whether to believe this evidence or accept Mannar\u2019s conflicting evidence was a question for the jury. United States v. Murphy, 35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994). The fact that the jury could not reach a verdict on the first count does not amount to a finding of entrapment; even if it did, it would not preclude a rejection of that defense for the second count. See United States v. Vaughn, 80 F.3d 549, 552-53 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (<HOLDING>). Mannar also asserts that the district court holding that jury finding of entrapment in may and june offenses did not extend to august offenseholding that erroneous exclusion of evidence regarding defendants lack of criminal record was not harmless in prosecution for drug offenses in which defendant asserted entrapmentholding that where jury was instructed on both a greater offense and lesserincluded offense and the jury convicted on the lesserincluded offense the double jeopardy provision prohibited retrial on the greater offenseholding that in the conviction and sentencing for criminal offenses committed in the course of one criminal episode it is the intent of the legislature that there be a separate conviction and sentence for each criminal offense unless one of the offenses is a degree of the other a necessarily included lesser offense subsumed in the other or both offenses are identicalholding that state may charge separately for the same offense but the convictions for more than one of the offenses cannot stand & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\n"}

Further, Monson\u2019s behavior falls outside of the sort of reckless or unfortunate but non-malicious acts that this Court have previously held do not rise to the standard of a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

The commentary in Collier on Bankruptcy suggests that the addition of \"actual fraud\u201d simply clarifies the limited scope of the fraud exception: The addition of the words \u201cor actual fraud\u201d probably makes no change in the law as it existed prior to enactment of the [Bankruptcy Act of 1978] because false pretenses and representations were construed to mean acts involving moral turpitude or intentional wrong....

Cucinotti next contends that the trial court erred in holding him personally liable. He points out that Reliance rested its theory of personal liability on several grounds, each of which was essentially abandoned in favor of the participation theory as articulated by the Supreme Court in its decision in Saltiel v. GSI Consultants, Inc., 170 N.J. 297, 788 A.2d 268 (2002), a decision released while the Reliance summary judgment motion was pending. While there are other reported decisions that hold that corporate officers who participate in fraud or conversion can be held personally liable for the losses occasioned thereby, see, e.g., Charles Bloom & Co. v. Echo Jewelers, 279 N.J.Super. 372, 382, 652 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.l995)(<HOLDING>); Robsac Indus., Inc. v.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Pardofigueroa also contends that the district holding guidelines to be only advisoryholding that the preponderance standard is generally appropriate in guidelines sentencingrecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standardholding that the district court determines the amount of loss under the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that under the advisory guidelines a district court should resolve factual disputes at sentencing by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\n3 . The Cities appear to have done just that, appealing the NPDES permits to the Environmental Appeals Board and challenging the use of the 2009 Document in that appeal. See, e.g., Pet'n for Review at 46, In re Town of Newmarket, No. NPDES 12-05 (Dec. 14, 2012) (arguing that \u201cEPA is illegally applying an unadopted, numeric criteri[on] violating applicable Federal law, in deciding that a 0.3mg\/L TN criteria must be met throughout the Great Bay Estuary to protect eelgrass\u201d), available at http:\/\/go.usa.gov\/4yYR. 4 .

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements. Given that role, Stern had a duty to disclose any known information necessary to prevent the Official Statements from being false or misleading. See Howard, 228 F.3d at 1061 (<HOLDING>). Allstate has further alleged that Stern holding a defendant may be convicted of mail fraud if he knowingly and willfully participates in a fraudulent scheme created and set in motion by othersholding that no judgment can be rendered against defendant who cannot be held liableholding that a person violates the bank fraud statute when he knowingly executes a scheme to obtain money from a financial institution by means of false or fraudulent representations if a defendant knowingly provided materially false information in order to induce the loan the crime is complete and it is irrelevant whether or not he intended to repay or was capable of repaying itholding that a defendant can be held liable when it knowingly participates in the creation of a false or misleading statementholding that the elements of a claim under 3729a2 are 1 that the defendant made used or caused to be made or used a record or statement to get a claim against the united states paid or approved 2 the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent and 3 the defendant knew that the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent emphasis added & \n\n(2d Cir. 1982)). The Court will not construe unfair competition\/misappropriation claims to apply to the two musical compositions at issue, however, because federal copyright law preempts them. Compare 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 301(a) (preempting state law claims \"equivalent\u201d to exclusive rights under the federal copyright laws for, inter alia, unpublished works created prior to 1978), with \u00a7 301(c) (excluding sound recordings fixed prior to February 15, 1972 from preemption until 2067). 19 .\u201d[T]he existence of a valid copyright\u201d is the first essential element for a claim of copyright infringement, under both New York law and federal law. Lime Grp., 784 F.Supp.2d at 436; see also Capitol Records, LLC v. Escape Media Grp., Inc., No. 12 Civ. 6646 (AJN), 2015 WL 1402049, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 25, 2015) (<HOLDING>). Likewise, a claim of unfair competition by holding that a fraud claim premised on thirdparty reliance raises a cognizable claim under new york lawholding that the most analogous claim for relief under new york law is a claim for employment discriminationholding that dalessio did not justify removal where the gravamen of plaintiffs complaint was that defendants made materially false statements to them in a manner prohibited by new york law and in violation of duties created by new york law and no construction or interpretation of federal law was requiredholding that new york law applies to this matterholding that elements of a common law copyrightinfringement claim under new york law mirror those of a federal copyrightinfringement claim & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nof influencing the grand jury as to any proper matter pertaining to its inquiry or which might have influenced the grand jury or impeded its inquiry.\u201d United States v. Doherty, 906 F.2d 41, 44 (1st Cir.1990); see also United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995). To be material, the statement \u201cneed not directly concern an element of the crime\u201d being investigated, \u201cnor need it actually influence the jury.\u201d Doherty, 906 F.2d at 44. Because materiality is a mixed question of fact and law for the jury, Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 512-15, 115 S.Ct. 2310, a court may only decide the issue, as a matter of law, when no reasonable juror could find materiality on the evidence presented, cf. In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 414 F.3d 187, 209 (1st Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). On appeal, Silveira contends that the holding that a district court may find acquitted conduct by a preponderance of the evidencerecognizing only that the guidelines must be advisory not that judges may find no factsholding that to find negligence jury need not find violation of federal motorcarrier regulationholding in a securities fraud action that a court may only find the lack of materiality where a jury could not reasonably find materialityholding in securities law context that in cases involving nondisclosure of material facts materiality rather than reliance becomes the decisive element of causation & \n\nN.Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 691(4). Plaintiffs filed their complaint in this action on March 26, 2001, alleging that defendants: (a) sold them franchises without having an offering prospectus registered with the State, in violation of section 683(1) (the prospectus claim); and (b) committed fraud in connection with the sale of franchises, in violation of section 687(2), because they induced plaintiffs to enter franchises with a false promise to pay 60% commissions for deliveries (the fraud claim). For both claims, therefore, the \u201cact or transaction constituting the violation\u201d occurred when the franchises were purchased. See United Magazine Co. v. Murdoch Magazines Distribution, Inc., 146 F.Supp.2d 385, 407 (S.D.N.Y.2001) (\u201cUnited Magazine \u201d), aff'd, 279 Fed.Appx. 14, 19 (2d Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>); Leung v.

Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla. Bar v. Brown, 905 So.2d 76, 81 (Fla.2005); see also Fla. Bar v. Riggs, 944 So.2d 167, 171 (Fla.2006) (<HOLDING>); Fla. Bar v. Barley, 881 So.2d 163, 169 holding that attorneys engaging in conduct involving dishonesty amounts to conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice lawholding intent as an element for disciplining an attorney for engaging in conduct involving dishonesty fraud deceit or misrepresentation is proven by establishing that the conduct was deliberate or knowingholding that an infamous crime under the arkansas constitution is a crime involving elements of deceit and dishonestyholding that reliance is not an element to be proven under securities fraud in indianaholding that in the context of federal immigration law the amount of loss to the victim of fraud or deceit does not refer to an element of the fraud or deceit but rather refers to the particular circumstances in which an offender committed fraud or deceit & \n\nto section 4177(d)(4) as section 4177(d)(4) defines fourth offenses as felonies. Therefore, we hold that only when an individual is convicted of a violation of 21 Del.C. \u00a7 4177(a), such violation occurring after three prior convictions under section 4177(a), may he or she be sentenced as a fourth-time offender under section 4177(d)(4). Conclusion We hold that it was an abuse of discretion for the Superior Court to admit the HGN evidence without the proper foundation. Because the error was not harmless, we reverse the appellant\u2019s conviction for the June 25, 1995 incident and remand the case for a new trial. Consequently, we also set aside Zimmerman\u2019s sentence for the Au person, bec o. 185, 1996, 1997 WL 70816 (Feb. 7, 1997) (ORDER). 9 . Id. at 356-62. 10 . See Ruthardt, 680 A.2d at 356 (<HOLDING>).

See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, 528 F.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir.2008). Since the only evidence that Petitioner was likely to be persecuted or tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination precludes success on his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005); cf. Ramsameachire v.

We decline to consider Petitioner\u2019s challenge holding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that defeat of asylum claim on credibility grounds does not necessarily preclude relief on a cat claimholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding it improper to deny cat relief based on adverse credibility finding where objective documentary evidence establishes likelihood of tortureholding that a negative credibility finding for the purposes of an asylum claim does not preclude relief under cat where documented country conditions corroborate a claim of torture & \n\nsuffered from past persecution nor had a well-founded fear of future persecution because of his Indian ethnicity. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s and Immigration Judge\u2019s findings of fact that Petitioner was not credible and that he failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review and uphold the Board\u2019s decision. A. Adverse Credibility Determination The Immigration Judge denied Petitioner refugee status primarily because she found that he was not credible. After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that substantial evidence supports this adverse credibility determination. An adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Yu, 364 F.3d at 703 (<HOLDING>). Such a finding \u201ccannot be based on an holding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding that where asylum officer testifies regarding accuracy of interviewing procedures inconsistencies between petitioners asylum interview testimony and merits hearing testimony form sufficient basis to uphold adverse credibility determinationholding when one identified ground for an adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of petitioners claim of persecution the court is bound to accept the ijs adverse credibility determinationholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibility & \n\nService; that Zou insufficiently explained material omissions in his earliest affidavit; and that Zou\u2019s version of events was not consistent with the documentary evidence he submitted. We agree that there is substantial evidence in the record for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination against Zou and for the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Zou asylum. We have carefully considered all of Zou\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Those arguments and supporting materials raised for the first time in this court without being properly presented to the IJ or the BIA cannot be considered; our jurisdiction is limited to the evidence in the record.

We have recognized that an IJ need not first identify the particular pieces of missing, relevant evidence, and show that this evidence was reasonably available to the applicant before relying on a lack of corroboration to support an adverse credibility finding. See Maladho Djehe Diallo v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 624, 633-34 (2d Cir.2006); cf. Chuilu Liu v. Holder, 575 F.3d 193, 198 (2d Cir.2009) (noting that an IJ must follow these steps in denying a claim based solely on insufficient corroboration, as opposed to adverse credibility). In light of the agency\u2019s reasonable adverse credibility finding, it did not err in denying Herath Mudiyan-selage\u2019s applications for relief. See Xiu Xia Lin, 534 F.3d at 167; Paul v.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 426 recognizing that a withholding of removal claim necessarily fails if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the factual predicate for the claims is the samerecognizing that withholding of removal claims must fail if petitioner is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the claims are based on the same factual predicateholding that although the ij did not explicitly analyze the cat claim the denial of the claim was linguistically separate from the denials of asylum and withholding under the inaholding that when the asylum withholding of removal and cat claims are based on the same factual predicate a credibility ruling necessarily forecloses relief in eachholding that the agency need not analyze separately a withholding of removal claim based on the same facts as an applicants asylum claim & \n\n\u201cI guess so.\u201d In light of the \u201chigh degree of deference\u201d that we must give to the factual determinations of the IJ, the inconsistencies in Kostic\u2019s testimony and written sub missions leave us with little choice but to uphold the adverse credibility determination. See Sterkaj v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 273, 278 (6th Cir.2006) (upholding an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination where an asylum applicant submitted an inconsistent document without explanation). Because Kostic cannot overcome the IJ\u2019s finding regarding his lack of credibility, he cannot prove that he is eligible for asylum. This also means that he cannot meet the more stringent standards required to qualify for withholding of removal. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 431-32, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (<HOLDING>). D. Changed country conditions The IJ and the holding that to establish asylum eligibility based on future persecution an applicant must show that he or she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear is objectively reasonableholding that absent past persecution an alien can demonstrate eligibility for asylum based on a wellfounded fear of future persecution by demonstrating that he or she subjectively fears persecution and that this fear is objectively reasonableholding that the clear probability standard for withholding of removal is higher than the standard for asylum which requires only a reasonable possibility of persecutionholding that the asylum standard for past persecution or wellfounded fear of future persecution is lower than the clear probability standard to show eligibility for withholding of removalholding that the standard for withholding of removal is more demanding than the standard for asylum & \n\nevidence and must uphold the decision unless the evidence compels a contrary result. Tekle v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 1044, 1051 (9th Cir. 2008). We affirm. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum based on an adverse credibility finding. Singh testified that he drove a taxi from 1998 to 2000 as his full-time job and was arrested a third time after driving militants in his taxi. In his application for redetermination of custody status, however, he stated that he was a farm worker during this period. When questioned about the inconsistency, Singh was evasive and nonresponsive. Because Singh provided inconsistent statements regarding the circumstances of his third arrest, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported. See Kohli v. Gonzales, 473 F.3d 1061, 1071 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Because Singh failed to establish eligibility holding that inconsistencies in the aliens statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility findingholding that minor discrepancies that do not involve the heart of the asylum claim are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility findingholding that ijs adverse credibility was not supported by substantial evidence where there were significant communication and translation problems during the asylum hearing and the discrepancies at issue were not crucial to petitioners claimholding that minor discrepancies in the date of an aliens graduation from high school as compared to the date of a beating did not justify an adverse credibility findingholding adverse credibility finding was supported based on discrepancies between aliens testimony and statements regarding a police detention & \n\nsize of the burns in making the adverse credibility determination. Sixth, the IJ commented that it was \u201cnoteworthy\u201d that Suntharalinkam had testified during the hearing that he was hospitalized for some ten days following his release from detention, whereas his asylum application did not mention hospitalization and instead only referred to medical treatment that he received at that time. The IJ\u2019s concern is unfounded, as in fact there is no \u201cdiscrepancy\u201d between the application and Suntharalinkam\u2019s testimony that can legally form the basis of an adverse credibility decision. An adverse credibility finding cannot be based on petitioner providing testimony that is more detailed than the information presented in the asylum application. See Singh v. INS, 292 F.3d 1017, 1021 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). Here, there is no contradiction between the holding that a failure to corroborate ones testimony with supporting evidence cannot form the sole basis for an adverse credibility determinationholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding that an adverse credibility finding can be based on materially different asylum claims in an airport interview and petitioners subsequent testimony before the ijholding that an adverse credibility determination cannot be based on trial testimony that is more detailed than the applicants initial statements at the airportholding that in the absence of an adverse credibility determination the court must accept petitioners testimony as true & \n\nv. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148 (2d Cir.2006), to challenge the BIA\u2019s consideration of the underlying adverse credibility determination is misplaced. In Paul, we held that the BIA abused its discretion by denying a motion to reopen based on changed country circumstances, where, despite an adverse credibility finding, the IJ had explicitly credited the movant\u2019s assertion regarding his religious affiliation that would likely result in persecution. Id. at 152-55. Here, unlike in Paul, the IJ did not find any aspect of petitioner\u2019s testimony credible, and the BIA reasonably relied on this general adverse credibility finding (along with other evidence) to find that petitioner did not adequately establish her religious affiliation. See Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, 500 F.3d 143, 146-49 (2d Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Because petitioner\u2019s assertion of ineffective holding that speculation and conjecture cannot support an adverse credibility findingholding that inconsistencies in the aliens statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility findingrecognizing that omissions of details may be an insufficient basis for upholding an adverse credibility findingholding a general adverse credibility finding may justify a decision to reject other claimsholding that history of dishonesty can support an adverse credibility finding & \n\nasylum application, but we find it doubtful that the DHS would deny asylum to the victim of a politically motivated, two-week detention filled with deliberate, vicious beatings but grant it to a similar applicant with additional nonlethal electrical shocks; pain is pain, whether inflicted with or without technological sophistication. Giday, 434 F.3d at 552. The discrepancies regarding Captain Azote\u2019s assassination, with the exception of those dealing with the motivation for the killing, are similarly unimportant. If Azote was killed for his association with Adekpe, it suggests that the government would likely kill Adekpe too, if given the chance, regardless of whether Azote was killed on a Monday or Saturday, walking or jogging. Kllokoqi v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 336, 341-42 (7th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Finally, the IJ found it unreasonable that holding that the date of the federal indictment not the date of the state arrest was the triggering date for the speedytrial actholding that minor discrepancies that do not involve the heart of the asylum claim are not an adequate basis for an adverse credibility findingholding that minor discrepancies in the date of an aliens graduation from high school as compared to the date of a beating did not justify an adverse credibility findingholding adverse credibility finding was supported based on discrepancies between aliens testimony and statements regarding a police detentionholding that inconsistencies in the aliens statements must go to the heart of the asylum claim to justify an adverse credibility finding & \n\nInstead, the BIA found him ineligible for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT on the merits. Because the BIA did not order Fajardo-Alvarez removed based upon his offense and made a determination on the merits, we have jurisdiction to review the decision. See Unuakhaulu v. Gonzales, 416 F.3d 931, 936-37 (9th Cir.2005). However, we lack jurisdiction to consider this petition on the merits. Fajardo-Alvarez failed to exhaust the critical issue of credibility in his appeal to the BIA, notwithstanding the IJ\u2019s clear and unambiguous findings regarding adverse credibility. See Barron v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004). We therefore have no basis to consider Fajardo-Alvarez\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT. See Zara v. Ashcroft, 383 F.3d 927, 931 (9th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). PETITION DENIED. ** This disposition is not holding where withholding of removal and cat claims were based on the same discredited testimony the bia properly concluded the adverse credibility finding was fatal to all claimsholding that when the asylum withholding of removal and cat claims are based on the same factual predicate a credibility ruling necessarily forecloses relief in eachholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that petitioners failure to exhaust the adverse credibility finding precluded this court from having jurisdiction to consider her claims of asylum withholding of removal and catholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibility & \n\nexplanation that any such discrepancy was a result of miscommunication with his lawyer. See Majid,i v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). Hariyanto argues that he corrected the error regarding his religion with the asylum officer during his asylum interview, but he failed to exhaust this contention before the BIA and the Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief; we therefore decline to consider this issue. See Lin Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007) (describing the issue exhaustion requirement as an \u201caffirmative defense subject to waiver\u201d). The adverse credibility finding was also based on Hariyanto\u2019s failure to submit sufficient evidence corroborating his claim. See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, 496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>); see also Maladho Djehe Diallo v. Gonzales, recognizing that an applicants failure to corroborate his or her testimony may bear on credibility because the absence of corroboration in general makes an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into questionrecognizing distinction made in maynard that one accomplices outofcourt statement may corroborate the incourt testimony of another accomplice but outofcourt testimony of a testifying accomplice cannot be used to corroborate his own testimonyholding that a failure to corroborate ones testimony with supporting evidence cannot form the sole basis for an adverse credibility determinationholding that when the ij has reason to question an aliens credibility material and easily available corroboration may be requiredholding that an ij may not use general information contained in a state department report to discredit specific testimony regarding an applicants personal experience & \n\nrejecting Djigo\u2019s explanations. See Majidi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 77, 80 (2d Cir.2005). Because the only evidence of a threat to Djigo\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, his failure to exhaust precludes success on his claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief where all three claims were based on the same factual predicate. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. 2 . Djigo challenges the IJ's adverse credibility finding in his brief to this Court, but did not do so before the BIA. We nonetheless address the adverse credibility determination because the government does not argue that the issue is unexhausted. See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 461 F.3d 101, 119-20 (2d Cir.2006) holding that exhaustion of issues is waived if not raised by the governmentholding that exhaustion of issues is jurisdictionalholding that issue exhaustion is not jurisdictional and thus waived if not raised by the governmentholding issues not raised in appellate brief are waivedholding that issues not raised before a district court are waived on appeal & \n\nthe same outcome even absent the flaws identified. See Xiao Ji Chen, 434 F.3d at 159-65. Even though Liu did not exhaust his withholding of removal claim before the BIA, the BIA considered and decided that claim. See Xian Tuan Ye, 446 F.3d at 296-97 (stating that the Court has jurisdiction to review a claim that was not argued before the BIA if the BIA nonetheless addressed it); Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511, 515 n. 7 (2d Cir.1994). However, because the only evidence of a threat of future persecution to Liu depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success not only on Liu\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of persecution, but also on his claim for withholding of removal. See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d 148, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>); Wu Biao Chen v. INS, 344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d holding that where the ij finds the petitioner to be credible his testimony must be acceptedrecognizing that a withholding of removal claim necessarily fails if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim and the factual predicate for the claims is the sameholding that for an applicant who has been determined to be incredible to prevail on a future persecution claim the predicate of that claim must be independent of the testimony that the ij found to be incredibleholding that to show an objectively reasonable fear of future persecution an applicant must establish that he would be singled out for persecution or that there was a pattern or practice of persecution of similarlysituated individualsholding that a claim including a constitutional claim must have been asserted to the trial court to be raised on appeal & \n\nthese documents also indicate that \u201c[n]ot all Christians ... have found themselves to be targets of ethnic-religious persecution\u201d and that \u201c[t]he ongoing insurgency affects every segment of the population, Sunni, Shi\u2019a, and non-Muslim alike.\u201d Christians In Iraq at 2.

Appellants forcefully argue that, in a series of decisions, the intermediate court has misconstrued our analysis and holding in Downingtown.

See Kaur, 413 F.3d at 234. Finally, the record supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Chen failed to demonstrate prima facie eligibility for relief under the CAT. We note that the BIA inaccurately found that Chen\u2019s evidence did not address the treatment of individuals repatriated to China. Nevertheless, the BIA cannot be said to have abused its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion without \u201cmore particularized evidence\u201d that she was more likely than not to be subjected to torture if returned to China.

The finality requirement comes from two sections in the APA. An \u201corder\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018the whole or a part of a final disposition ... of an agency in a matter other than rule making.\u2019 \u201d Air Cal. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 654 F.2d 616, 620 (9th Cir.1981) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(6)). The APA only allows judicial review of \u201cfinal agency actions.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704. Thus, if an FAA order is not final, neither we nor the district court have jurisdiction over the case. See Air Cal, 654 F.2d at 622 (<HOLDING>). As a result of the finality conundrum, the holding district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the document before the district court in this instance is not a vehicle for any recognized legal remedy under the rulesholding that this court lacked preliminary authority to review the district courts jurisdiction because there was no immediately appealable order before the courtholding that the district court lacked jurisdiction to review state disciplinary proceedings against attorneyholding that this court lacked jurisdiction under 46110 for lack of finality and that the district court also lacked jurisdiction because the orders were not final and thus not ripe for reviewholding that plaintiffs lacked standing because the case was not ripe for adjudication & \n\nGiven her admissions, which are described above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs interests \u201c \u2018are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the [TCPA] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Clarke, 479 U.S. at 399, 107 S.Ct. 750). Indeed, it is unfathomable that Congress considered a consumer who files TCPA actions as a business when it enacted the TCPA as a result of its \u201coutrage over the proliferation of prerecorded telemarketing calls to private residences, which consumers 'regarded as an intrusive invasion of privacy and a nuisance.\u201d Leyse, 804 F.3d at 325 (internal quotations and alterations omitted).

But in federal-question cases, the identity of the parties is irrelevant and the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is grounded in the federal question(s) raised by the plaintiff. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The jurisdictional requirement, therefore, prevents the enlargement of federal jurisdiction in such cases only where a proposed intervenor seeks to bring new state-law claims. See, e.g., Beckman Indus., Inc., 966 F.2d at 473 (<HOLDING>); Blake, 554 F.2d at 956-57.

Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979)). Similarly, the court can find no such exception with respect to plaintiffs Puerto Rico law claims. Courts will only find that a state has waived its own Eleventh Amendment immunity by legislative fiat where the same is \u201cstated \u2018by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as will leave no room for any other reasonable construction.\u2019 \u201d Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974) (quoting Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U.S. 151, 171, 29 S.Ct. 458, 53 L.Ed. 742 (1909)); see also Atascadero State Hosp. v.

Laws 17 and 69 do include the Commonwealth holding that the statute must specify the states intention to subject itself to suit in federal court in order to constitute a waiverholding that the filing deadline under title vii is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to suit in federal court but a requirement that like a statute of limitations is subject to waiver estoppel and equitable tollingholding that a states consent to suit in federal court must be unequivocally expressedholding individual defendants subject to suitholding in a patent case that when the plaintiff brought the suit in federal district court it submitted itself to the jurisdiction of the court with respect to all the issues embraced in the suit including those pertaining to the counterclaim of the defendants & \n\nmust provide it with clear notice that it is subject to suit here. AMAF, 428 A.2d at 851-852; see also Trerotola v. Cotter, 601 A.2d 60, 64 (D.C.1991); Ross v. Product Development Corp., 736 F.Supp. 285, 290 (D.D.C.1989). Appellant relies on D.C.Code \u00a7 13-334(a) as a basis for her claim that the trial court had general jurisdiction over IDE-SA. As a preliminary matter, we must determine whether the defendant was properly served under \u00a7 13-334(a), i.e., whether IDESA was personally served in the District of Columbia. In this case, that did not happen; by her own admission, appellant served IDESA in Mexico. As a consequence, appellant has \u201cfailed to comply with the statute\u2019s mandate, and [is] thus foreclosed from benefiting from its jurisdictional protection.\u201d Everett, 628 A.2d at 108 (<HOLDING>).

The Copyright Act Standard The Copyright Act protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (1994). Although copyright does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, or methods of operation, it is well established that the protection encompasses software. See Computer Management Assistance Co. v. Robert F. DeCastro, Inc., 220 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). A copyright owner possesses the exclusive holding that copyright protection of computer programs extend beyond the programs literal code to their structure sequence and organizationholding that while the computer program at issue was within the subject matter of copyright the right sought under state law pursuant to a license was not equivalent to the exclusive rights under copyright as such copyright preemption did not applyholding that because literary works including compilations and derivative works are within the subject matter of copyright state common law that purported to protect a work for which plaintiffs copyright action was unsuccessful was preemptedholding that prejudgment interest ordinarily should be awarded on damages pursuant to claims under the copyright act of 1909 17 usc 1 et seq 1976 ed superceded by the copyright act of 1976 17 usc 101 et seqrecognizing that the copyright act was amended in 1976 to include computer programs in the definition of protectable literary works & \n\nand a Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Contract. That letter stated that the MHFA was \"constrained to vigorously enforce\u201d the state notice provisions for the benefit of low income tenants and that the agency would \"employ the courts to compel compliance by HUD with the terms of the Contract,\u201d if necessary. (Appellant's Add. at AD-15-16.) We conclude that the prior, thr\u00e9\u00e1t of a court action against HUD in the context of a Section 8 housing contract and a different property does not justify a preenforcement suit by Forest Park II in this Section 236 loan prepayment context, where no threat of enforcement action was made and no First Amendment or other constitutional rights are at issue. See Virginia v. Am. Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 392-93, 108 S.Ct. 636, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988) recognizing that plaintiffs had standing to allege infringements of their first amendment rights where the record established that they had been threatened with enforcement of the statute and that such enforcement would cause them injuryrecognizing the cause of actionholding that to bring a 1983 cause of action there must be some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action and that a preenforcement suit is justified where there exists a wellfounded fear of enforcement that would infringe upon the exercise of first amendment rightsholding that not all adverse action taken against a public employee in retaliation for exercising first amendment rights is sufficient to support a cause of action under 1983holding that to bring a cause of action in federal court requires that plaintiffs establish at an irreducible minimum an injury in fact that is there must be some threatened or actual injury resulting from the putatively illegal action & \n\ndiversity between adverse parties that arises from a single accident.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(e)(1)(A) permits removal of a civil action to a federal district court if \"the action could have been brought in a United States district court under 1369 of this title ....\" 7 . Nor do we, as we affirm the district court's jurisdiction under CAFA. 8 . 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d)(1)(B); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453(a) (\u201cDefinitions. \u2014 In this section, the terms 'class\u2019, \u2018class action\u2019, 'class certification order\u2019, and \u2018class member\u2019 shall have the meanings given such terms under section 1332(d)(1).\u201d). 9 . See, e.g., Wilson v. Omaha Indian Tribe, 442 U.S. 653, 658, 666-67, 99 S.Ct. 2529, 61 L.Ed.2d 153 (1979) (citing United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604-05, 61 S.Ct. 742, 85 L.Ed. 1071 (1941)) (<HOLDING>); see also Will v. Mich.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 l-277(a) and 7A-27(d). Notably, Defendants also contend that their appeal to this Court is permitted by N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 l-277(b), which provides that \u201c[a]ny interested party shall have the right of immediate appeal from an adverse ruling as to the jurisdiction of the court over the person or property of the defendant.\u201d Thus, because the order being appealed from denied Defendants\u2019 12(b)(2) motion, Defendants contend that this Court has jurisdiction over this appeal under \u00a7 l-277(b). See Data Gen. Corp. v. Cnty. of Durham, 143 N.C. App. 97, 99-100, 545 S.E.2d 243, 245-46 (2001) (<HOLDING>). However, while \u201c[a] motion to dismiss based holding that the denial of a motion to remand is interlocutory and not immediately appealableholding a decision denying a motion to dismiss an action for lack of personal and subject matter jurisdiction is not appealableholding that denial of counsel in section 1983 action is not immediately appealableholding that a denial of a 12b2 motion for lack of personal jurisdiction on the ground of sovereign immunity is immediately appealableholding if immunity is raised as a basis in the motion for summary adjudication a substantial right is affected and the denial is immediately appealable & \n\nto state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the D.C. Circuit has explained that because the FTCA waives sovereign immunity only as to claims where the government would be liable under local law, and because that waiver is \"coextensive with the district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to hear the case,\u201d the government\u2019s \"arguments against [a plaintiff\u2019s] proposed local analogs\u201d actually go to the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. See Hornbeck, 569 F.3d at 512; see also Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) (governing motions to dismiss for \"lack of subject-matter jurisdiction\u201d). 12 . Defendant also argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction over Mr. Lewis\u2019s claims pursuant to the Feres doctrine. See Feres v. United States, 340 U.S. 135, 71 S.Ct. 153, 95 L.Ed. 152 (1950) (<HOLDING>). Although the Court has serious doubts about holding that where the employment of the injured employees was the occasion of the injury the injuries arose out of employmentholding that where the claimants were servicemen injured or killed while on active duty due to the negligence of others in the armed forces they could not seek recovery under the ftca for injuries sustained that arose out of or were incident to their military serviceholding that tort claims were arbitrable because they arose out of and were related to contractholding that the govemment is not liable under the federal tort claims act for injuries to service members where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to military serviceholding that the united states is immune from monetary damages for injuries to servicemen where the injuries arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service & \n\n2123, 115 L.Ed.2d 27 (1991) (emphasizing the inherent power of federal courts to \u201cmanage their own affairs\u201d and stating that \u201cCourts of justice are universally acknowledged to be vested, by their very creation, with power to impose silence, respect, and decorum, in their presence.\u201d). Furthermore, the mandates of Rule 11 are not absolute. and contempt sanctions, the imposition of a Rule 11 sanction is not a judgment on the merits. Rather, it requires determining a collateral issue: whether the attorney has abused the judicial process and, if so, the appropriate sanction. Lefley v. United States, No. 259-89, 1997 WL 718468, at *11-12, 1997 U.S. Claims LEXIS 309, at *34-35 (Ct.Cl. July 31, 1997); see also Willy v. Coastal Corp., 503 U.S. 131,137-38, 112 S.Ct. 1076,117 L.Ed.2d 280 (1992) (<HOLDING>). In Cooter & Gell, the Supreme Court set forth holding that a district court had jurisdiction to impose rule 11 sanctions regardless of the existence of subjectmatter jurisdictionholding that an award of sanctions under rule 11 survives despite a later determination that the court lacked subject matter jurisdictionholding that a district court could constitutionally impose rule 11 sanctions in a case in which was later determined that the court lacked subject matter jurisdictionholding that rule 11 sanctions imposed by district court remained in effect after case was remanded to state court upon a finding that district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the caseholding that a district court may impose sanctions for abuse of judicial process pursuant to rule 11 even after it is determined that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the plaintiffs claims & \n\nof tolling. Id. at 1474. Accordingly, the Court finds that federal law, not state law, governs whether the limitations period in this case was tolled; and \u00a7 657-13 does not operate to toll t rom other jurisdictions are sharply divided on this issue. One line of cases holds that mental incompetency may not toll federal statutes of limitations. E.g., Harris v. Ford Motor Co., supra, 635 F.Supp. 1472 (E.D.Mo.1986) (and cases cited therein) (mental incompetency does not toll DelCostello six month period on hybrid claims). However, most of the decisions relied upon in Harris involved claims against the federal government and therefore are called into question by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in Irwin v. Veterans Administration, 498 U.S. 89, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, another line of eases holding that equitable principles apply to child support proceedingsholding tolling principles do not apply because the purpose of the statute of repose is clearly to serve as a cutoffholding that in statute authorizing suits against united states limits time period in which such suits may be brought united states retains its sovereign immunity as to any suits brought outside of that time period therefore court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over suit against united states that is barred by statute of limitationsholding that we lacked jurisdiction to review the veterans courts determination that equitable tolling did not apply in the case before itholding that equitable tolling principles apply to suits against the united states in the same manner as they apply to private parties & \n\na defense to the claims asserted. It is a \"constitutional principle\u201d that \"limit[s] the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction under Article III,\u201d Seminole Tribe v. Fla., 517 U.S. 44, 64, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), therefore the Court considers Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on the basis of sovereign immunity as attacking subject matter jurisdiction. 9 . FMC v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 753-54, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (explaining that \"the Eleventh Amendment does not define the scope of the States' sovereign immunity; it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity .... the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d); see also Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890) (<HOLDING>). 10 . This suit primarily seeks declaratory holding that sovereign immunity barred a federal question suit against a state brought by one of its own citizens even though the text of the eleventh amendment only addresses suits brought by citizens of another stateholding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that the eleventh amendment protects a state from suit by its own citizensholding state immune from suit brought by its own citizensholding that utah did not waive its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to a suit brought in federal court because state statute provided for exclusive original jurisdiction in its own courts & \n\nBeverages & Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 51, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990). But despite the constitutional requirement that there be a remedy, the Supreme Court expressly noted in Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 115 S.Ct. 547, 130 L.Ed.2d 454 (1994), that \u201cthe sovereign immunity [that] States enjoy in federal court, under the Eleventh Amendment, does generally bar tax refund claims from being brought in that forum.\u201d Id. at 110, 115 S.Ct. 547 (second emphasis added). To ensure that taxpayers possess an avenue for relief, the Court held that state courts must hear suits to recover taxes unlawfully exacted, the \u201csovereign immunity [that] States traditionally enjoy in their own courts notwithstanding.\u201d Id.; cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 740, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (<HOLDING>). Reasoning analogously, we conclude that the holding that in statute authorizing suits against united states limits time period in which such suits may be brought united states retains its sovereign immunity as to any suits brought outside of that time period therefore court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over suit against united states that is barred by statute of limitationsholding that congress has power to subject the states to wage and hour regulationholding that congress did not properly abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity from suits under the patent actholding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that congress cannot subject states to suits in state courts but taking care not to overrule reich & \n\nauthority to determine whether we 'have jurisdiction over deportation orders\u2018concerning alleged aggravated felons as described in Tapia Garcia, supra, \u201cthe plain language of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) fairly explicitly strips the courts of appeals of jurisdiction to hear their claims on petitions for direct review.\u201d Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U.S. 348, 351, 121 S.Ct. 2268, 150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001). Because Mr. Latu does not contest his status as an aggravated felon subject to removal, thereby admitting the jurisdip-tional fact that strips the court of jurisdiction to review his final order-of removal, he has not. failed to seek an available judicial remedy, and he is not procedurally barred from habeas review in the district court. See Noriega-Lopez v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 874, 878 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Ramtulla v. Ashcroft, 301 F.3d 202, 203 & n. recognizing appellate court jurisdiction over questions of law when objections were not presented belowrecognizing that failure by state to provide the required certification deprives appeals court of jurisdiction over appealholding that subject matter questions may be but are not necessarily decided before questions of personal jurisdictionholding that review of questions not raised to the bia is barredholding that 1252a2c deprives court of appeals of jurisdiction over constitutional questions as well as other questions presented in petition for review by removable alien who has committed qualifying aggravated felony & \n\nthe federal officer removal statute. When the Second Circuit held that removal was improper under section 1442, it necessarily held that this Court lacked jurisdiction because there is no independent statute that gives original subject matter jurisdiction to federal courts over cases involving federal officers. \"Federal jurisdiction rests on a \u2018federal interest in the matter,\u2019 the very basic interest in the enforcement of federal law through federal officials.\u201d Willingham v.

It is a rule of primary jurisdiction, allocating to an administrative agency the first crack at certain matters.\u201d). Accordingly, Garmon preemption provides no basis for removal jurisdiction in federal court. A case falling within the scope of the doctrine must be adjudicated before the NLRB. The lower courts are uniform in finding that Garmon preemption under the NLRA does not completely preempt state laws so as to provide removal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Ethridge v.

Given that the district court treated the order allowing attorneys\u2019 fees as an appealable order and that the parties do not object to treating it as such, we find no reason to remand for formal compliance with Rule 58. Domegan, 972 F.2d 401 (<HOLDING>), vacated on other grounds, 507 U.S. 956, 113 holding that there was appellate jurisdiction under principle that a premature notice of appeal from a nonfinal order may ripen into a valid notice of appeal if a final judgment has been entered by the time the appeal is heard and the appellee suffers no prejudiceholding that court had jurisdiction where no separate judgment had been entered even though notice of appeal was not timely filed as measured from the final decisionholding that a notice of appeal is timely when filed before final judgment is entered by the district courtholding that lack of a separate judgment does not preclude the taking of an appeal from a district courts final decision because the parties may waive the separate judgment requirement where one has accidentally not been enteredholding that notice of appeal was not effectively taken where appeal was filed simultaneously with timely motion for reconsideration because when timely motion for reconsideration is filed a notice of appeal filed prior to disposition of the motion to reconsider has no effect & \n\nof conviction, [and Benris] conviction[s] [are] not ripe for appeal.\u201d Ex parte Kelley, \u2014 So.3d at \u2014. Consequently, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Benris appeal. The State appears to concede that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Kelley supports the position that no judgments of conviction have been entered in these cases but argues that this Court should nonetheless hold that the issuance of a sentencing order without the pronouncement in open court of a sentence is sufficient to enter Benn\u2019s judgments of conviction. In Ex parte Kelley, the Alabama Supreme Court considered the State\u2019s argument and rejected it, holding that nothing less than a pronouncement in open court of the defendant\u2019s sentence will satisfy the sentencing element of a judgment of conviction. \u2014 So.3d \u2014 (<HOLDING>). \u201c[T]his Court is bound by the decisions of holding that the trial courts oral expression in open court of its future intention to render a judgment was not itself a judgment but rather the trial courts written findings of fact and conclusions of law were its judgmentholding that the trial courts written order was not the entry of a sentence sufficient to support a determination that a judgment of conviction was enteredholding premature notice of appeal was treated as entered on date of entry of final judgmentholding that in the interest of judicial economy considering appeal from order denying posttrial motions and ordering entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff even though judgment was not actually enteredholding that because trial courts order did not dispose of the defendants counterclaim that order was not a final judgment that would support an appeal & \n\naddition, AmMed Surgical shall provide this court with a copy of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. Order to show cause discharged. ALTENBERND and BLACK, JJ., Concur. 1 . Although it was the defendant\/debtor that filed the notice of appeal, the appeal is considered to be the continuation of a proceeding \"against the debtor,\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1). See, e.g., Crowe Grp., Inc. v. Garner, 691 So.2d 1089, 1089 (Fla. 2d DCA 1993); Ingersoll-Rand Fin. Corp. v. Miller Mining Co., 817 F.2d 1424, 1426 (9th Cir.1987), 2 . U.S. Const, art. VI, cl. 2. 3 .The same is true of rule 9.110(b), which also sets the notice-of-appeal deadline for final orders at thirty days from rendition. See, e.g., First Nat\u2019l Bank in Fort Myers v. Fla. Unemployment Appeals Comm\u2019n, 461 So.2d 208, 208 (Fla. 1st DCA 1984) holding that identification of appellant in notice of appeal is a jurisdictional requirement and that the failure to name a party in a notice to appeal constitutes a failure of that party to appealholding that the 30day deadline to file a notice of appeal with the bia was not jurisdictionalholding 30day limit to be mandatory and jurisdictionalholding that in the appeal of a final order the fjailure to file any notice within the 30day period constitutes an irremediable jurisdictional defectholding that the 30day notice of appeal requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional & \n\nlog indicated the notice of appeal was accepted by the mail room on Monday, November 3, 2003, Singletary deposited the mail in the legal mail box no earlier than Friday, October 31, 2003, two days after the excusable neglect period expired. Thus, the magistrate judge apparently concluded that the appeal period could not be extended. See Hensley v. Chesapeake & O. Ry. Co., 651 F.2d 226, 228 (4th Cir.1981) (finding that expiration of time limits in Rule 4 deprives court of jurisdiction over case). The record was then returned to us for further review. It appears from our review of the record that the magistrate judge\u2019s order may be a dispositive ruling as it potentially ends Singletary\u2019s ability to pursue his appeal. See Vitols v. Citizens Banking Co., 984 F.2d 168, 169-70 (6th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the magistrate judge only is authorized holding that it is unconstitutional for a us magistrate judge to exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 usc 636c over a 2255 motionholding that a motion to certify a district court order for interlocutory appeal is dispositiveholding that under 28 usc 1292b the appellate courts may review only matters in the order not all issues in the caseholding that a magistrate judge acting pursuant to 636b1 has no authority to issue a dispositive ruling on a motion to certify a district court order for interlocutory appeal under 28 usc 1292b 2000 holding the failure to file objections to a magistrates report issued pursuant to 28 usc 636b1 waives the right to appeal all issues both factual and legal & \n\nbecause the notice of appeal mentioned both the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss Plaintiffs action and the district court\u2019s decision denying Plaintiffs Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for relief from that decision, we have jurisdiction to review both of those decisions. See Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B). See generally Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (construing pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings liberally). In his appellate brief, however, Plaintiff also challenges the district court\u2019s decision to deny his later-filed Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion for reconsideration. Because Plaintiff never filed a separate notice of appeal from that denial, we have no jurisdiction to consider it. See Bowles v. Russell, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007) (<HOLDING>); see also Stouffer v.

In any case, the record indicates that Matthews and Owens in fact received notice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d See Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). Here, Matthews and Owens received actual notice by mail \u2014 as they admit \u2014 which set forth the claim deadline in bold lettering and unambiguously warned them of the ramifications of inaction. See Dusenbery v. United States, 534 U.S. 161, 170-73, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002) (<HOLDING>). That Matthews and Owens filed a petition in holding that the government need not prove actual notice to the prisonerholding that due process requires that notice be reasonably calculated under all circumstances to provide parties with notice of the pending actionholding notice of impending tax sale of property was not reasonably calculated to reach property owner when notice sent via certified letter by state was returned unclaimed and state did not take additional reasonable steps to ensure notice was providedholding that notice of administrative forfeiture sent to prisoner did not require actual notice to the property owner only notice reasonably calculated to apprise a party of the pendency of the actionholding that actual receipt of notice is not necessary to satisfy 1607 or due process the government need only make an effort that is reasonably calculated to apprise a party of the pendency of the action & \n\nand, thus, the order fell easily within the ambit of Rule 2 (a)(6). But even more to the point, National Enterprises has taken inconsistent positions with respect to the chancery court\u2019s 1994 order. In its first notice of appeal in 1994, National Enterprises referred to the 1994 order as a \u201cfinal Order\u201d and stated that it was appealing issues relating to the deeds, easements, and the License Agreement and specifically mentioned ingress and egress and parking. Because National Enterprises failed to perfect its appeal in a timely fashion by tendering the record too late, it failed to appeal the 1994 order. Because the order was not appealed, it became a final order and became binding on all the parties. See, e.g., Millers Cas. Ins. Co. v. Fauria, 279 Ark. 291, 651 S.W.2d 80 (1983) (<HOLDING>). In addition to its notice of appeal, on May recognizing that a final judgment may provide for a particular standard upon which to modify a final judgmentholding that poliey language stating that insurer will pay all interest accruing on judgment against its insured requires an insurer to pay interest on the entire judgment amountholding that court of appeals was without jurisdiction to modify judgment against insurer because judgment against insurer became final when it failed to appealholding that in a dispute between insurer and insured in which the insurer admitted liability hut disputed the amount of damages it was only after entry of a judgment upon that verdict that the claim became liquidatedholding that the trial court had no jurisdiction to modify its final order more than 30 days after its final judgment & \n\nmoves into the realm of res judicata.\u201d). The doctrine of issue preclusion \u201ccomes into play when an issue involved in a prior decision is the same issue involved in a subsequent action.\u201d See Mabry v. State Bd. of Community Colleges & Occupational Educ., 813 F.2d 311, 316 (10th Cir.1987). If the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover order, which the debtors did not appeal, \u201cactually and necessarily decided\u201d the exemption issue, principles of issue preclusion could prevent the debtors from raising this argument in an appeal from a subsequent order. See id. (noting that issue preclusion does not apply unless \u201cthe issue is actually decided in the first action\u201d and \u201cit was necessary to decide the issue in disposing of the first action\u201d); see also In re Albrecht, 233 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Turshen v. Chapman, 823 F.2d 836, 839 (4th holding that court lacked jurisdiction on appeal from injunction because the order was simply an interpretation of an earlier orderholding that under the doctrine of direct estoppel a law firms failure to appeal the bankruptcy courts earlier order barred it from challenging the courts holding on its appeal from a subsequent orderholding that an issue not raised on direct appeal of sentence is barred by the law of the case from presentation in a subsequent appealholding that notice indicating appeal was from judgment on date of jury verdict was insufficient to preserve appeal from earlier order granting summary judgmentholding that under the law of the case doctrine an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal & \n\nORDER Plaintiff-Appellant Felix I. Lessambo, pro se, appeals from the September 29, 2010 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, \/.) dismissing the complaint on summary judgment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history of the case. This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the District Court\u2019s June 2009 decision granting the motion for partial judgment on the pleadings because that decision was not designated in Lessambo\u2019s notice of appeal, as required by Rule 3(c)(1)(B) of the Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure. See Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., 70 F.3d 255, 256 (2d Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, insofar as Lessambo challenges the holding that mothers failure to appeal prior contempt order precluded her challenge to prior order in appeal from later order entered based upon prior contempt orderholding that the appeal was properly before the court where the appellant appealed from an order amending a prior order without appealing from the prior orderholding that when a notice of appeal specified one district court order while failing to reference another an appeal from the unmentioned order cannot be consideredholding that court lacked jurisdiction on appeal from injunction because the order was simply an interpretation of an earlier orderholding that because the district courts order failed to comply with rule 58 appellants notice of appeal cannot be considered late & \n\n1999) (quoting Chitwood, 443 S.W.2d at 830-31) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court entered separate orders of dismissal for the chancery court and circuit court cases. Only one order was appealed. Because consolidated lawsuits remain separate actions, \u201cit logically fol lows that consolidation cannot cure defects in either lawsuit.\u201d Givens v. Vanderbilt Univ., No. M2011-00186-COA-R3-CV, 2011 WL 5145741, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App., filed Oct. 28, 2011) (citing McMillin, 2009 WL 749214, at *3). The developers\u2019 appeal of the order of dismissal in the circuit court case does not constitute an appeal of the chancery court case. Without an appeal, the chancery court order became a final judgment thirty days after it was entered. Creech v. Addington, 281 S.W.3d 363, 377 (Tenn. 2009) (<HOLDING>). \u201cThe thirty-day time limit for filing a holding attorney may not wait more than thirty days from the entry of final judgment give notice of nonrepresentation and then seek to enforce a hen not noticed before the entry of the final judgmentholding that the requirement to serve a motion for attorney fees or costs within thirty days after filing of judgment applies even where the final judgment reserves jurisdiction to award sameholding that california supreme courts denial of habeas petition becomes final thirty days after filingholding in part as a general rule a trial courts judgment becomes final thirty days after its entry unless a party files a timely notice of appeal or specified posttrial motionholding that trial court has no power to allow party to amend motion for new trial more than thirty days after trial court signed the final judgment and that denial of amended motion for new trial filed more than thirty days after judgment preserved nothing for appellate review & \n\nadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (quotations omitted). Because the district court did not rule on whether to grant Valencia a COA, we assume it was denied. 10th Cir. R. 22.1(C). Accordingly, she may not appeal the district court's decision absent a grant of COA by this court. 2 . Because the district court did not enter a separate judgment disposing of Valencia\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition, judgment is deemed entered 150 days from the entry of the relevant order. Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(b)(2)(B). Thus, the judgment dismissing the first \u00a7 2255 petition is deemed entered on September 18, 2006, and Valencia\u2019s June 26, 2006 Notice of Appeal is timely. See Thompson v. Gibson, 289 F.3d 1218, 1221 (10th Cir.2002) holding that a notice of appeal is timely when filed before final judgment is entered by the district courtholding that a judgment is final only when the parties have exhausted their respective rights to appeal or if no party to the action filed a timely appealholding that court had jurisdiction where no separate judgment had been entered even though notice of appeal was not timely filed as measured from the final decisionholding that a conviction is deemed final on the date of sentencing when there is no evidence that notice of appeal was filedholding that notice of appeal was not effectively taken where appeal was filed simultaneously with timely motion for reconsideration because when timely motion for reconsideration is filed a notice of appeal filed prior to disposition of the motion to reconsider has no effect & \n\nor by failing to grant his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for an extension of time. {91} We uphold the constitutionality of the Capital Felony Sentencing Act. The evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings of the aggravating factors charged. The evidence also supports the jury\u2019s findings that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The facts of Clark\u2019s case support the conclusion that the jury did not impose his death sentence under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Taking Clark, the circumstances of the crime, and other similar New Mexico cases into consideration, Clark\u2019s sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate. We affirm Clark\u2019s sentence. Finally, we conclude tha 91) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). 3 . See State v. Dodd, 120 Wash.2d 1, 838 holding the court lacked jurisdiction where the defendant failed to file a notice of appeal on the attorneys fee issue because a supplemental notice of appeal is required for us to have jurisdiction over an attorneys fees issue that becomes final subsequent to the initial notice of appealholding that an express waiver of the right to appeal the sentence was invalid because the trial court had failed properly to advise the defendant and that the defendant therefore did not waive his right to appeal the legality of his sentenceholding that a notice of appeal filed in an adversary proceeding could not appeal the main proceedingholding that a capital defendant must receive a meaningful appeal with the benefit of an adversary proceeding with diligent appellate advocacy addressed to both the judgment and the sentence but allowing the defendant to file a pro se supplemental brief setting forth his personal positions and interests with regard to the subject matter of this appealholding defendants pro se motion to reduce sentence was not properly before the trial court when defendant was represented by counsel since defendant may not proceed both by counsel and pro se & \n\ncourt with those facts relevant to the court\u2019s appellate review of agency action. Rule 80B(d) is not intended to allow the reviewing court to retry the facts that were presented to the governmental \u25a0 decision-maker, nor does it apply to any independent civil claims contained in the complaint. Rather, it is intended to allow the reviewing court to obtain facts not in the record that are necessary to the appeal before the court. See Palesky v. Secretary of State, 1998 ME 103, \u00b6\u00b6 5-9, 711 A.2d 129, 131-132. For example, the complainant may augment the record if there are claims of ex parte communication or bias alleged, with sufficient particularity, to have had an effect on the fairness of the governmental proceedings, see, e.g., White v. Town of Hollis, 589 A.2d 46, 48 (Me.1991) (<HOLDING>); Ryan v. Town of Camden, 582 A.2d 973, 975 holding that defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law which was denied by the district court when they made it at the close of the evidence limited the relief the appellate court could grant to a new trialholding that seventh application for postconviction relief which was rejected because evidence on which it was based was not properly authenticated was properly filedholding rule 80bd motion was properly denied because petitioner was not entitled to relief as a matter of lawholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he received notice and failed to properly file a claimholding that the defendants motion for discharge was premature and thus properly denied by the trial court & \n\nthe divorce judgment, i.e., that a jurisdictional defect appeared on the face of the record. See Walker, supra. Thus, we reject any contention that the trial court lacked any evidence on which to base its finding that the father had failed to properly register the divorce judgment. The father next argues that the trial court, for a variety of reasons, erred in setting aside the 2006 modification judgment; however, the father appealed only the March 28, 2011, judgment, which dismissed only the petition for a rule nisi and the petition to modify the divorce judgment filed on August 6, 2009. We, therefore, cannot consider any arguments addressed toward the propriety of the judgment setting aside the 2006 modification judgment. See Landry v. Landry, 42 So.Sd 755, 757-58 (Ala.Civ.App.2009) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, because the trial court relied holding that the appellate court should have construed the notice of appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment as an attempt to appeal from the underlying judgmentholding that notice indicating the appeal was from summary judgment order was insufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction to reach appellants challenge to earlier order compelling arbitrationrecognizing that an appellants failure to properly file a notice of appeal as to a particular judgment prevents an appellate court from obtaining jurisdiction to review that judgmentholding that when an appeal is properly taken from an underlying judgment the court of appeals has discretion to review a subsequent order denying a motion to vacateholding the trial court was without authority to dismiss an appeal on the ground that the amount of the judgment required the appellant to file an application for discretionary review & \n\nweighed against a finding of good cause. Furthermore, Ms. Wright did not provide any evidence that she acted diligently in the thirteen year interim. She also did not identify any circumstances beyond her control that prevented her from appealing at any point during the thirteen years. Thus, we affirm the Board\u2019s holding that Ms. Wright did not show good cause for her delay in filing her appeal. Costs Each party shall bear its own costs. AFFIRMED. 1 . Even if Ms. Wright was found credible, and the November 2009 date claimed in her initial appeal or the June 2009 date claimed in her petition for review was the first time she received notice of her termination, her October 2010 appeal would still be untimely. See Gordy v. Merit. Sys. Prot. Bd., 736 F.2d 1505, 1508 (Fed.Cir.1984) holding that where employee was aware of dissolution abatement of claims provision applied even in absence of written notice because employee had actual noticeholding that when an employee is not provided with notice of termination and appeal rights by an employing agency a dismissal based on untimeliness may be proper if the employee fails to act promptly and within the allowable time limits after he or she becomes aware of those rightsholding that res judicata properly barred claims based on an employers decision to terminate an employee because the termination was not a fresh act of discrimination rather it was the same decision not to allow the employee to return to work that the employee had challenged previouslyholding that a notice recommending termination of an employee to the board without notice to the employee of employees right to attend and dispute the claims violated due processholding that rights accrue only when an employee vests & \n\nW. Reginald Rose, Jr., and Laura J. Rose appeal pro se from the district court\u2019s order dismissing their civil rights complaint for failing to comply with Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The district court dismissed the Roses\u2019 complaint without prejudice and granted leave to amend. Rather than filing an amended complaint or obtaining a final order of dismissal from the district court, the Roses filed a notice of appeal. We therefore lack jurisdiction. See WMX Techs., Inc. v. Miller, 104 F.3d 1133, 1136-37 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (<HOLDING>). DISMISSED. ** This disposition is not holding that denial of a postconviction motion without prejudice and with leave to amend is not a final appealable orderholding that dismissal with leave to amend is not a final orderholding that a district courts dismissal that expressly grants leave to amend is not final and that a final judgment must be obtained before such a case becomes appealableholding that a district court judgment is not a final judgment appealable by the defendant unless it includes the final adjudication and the final sentenceholding that when a district court expressly grants leave to amend it is plain that the order is not final & \n\ngiven the defendant, a foreign state to be served under section 1608(a), was insufficient to meet the requirements of the FSIA. See also Shen v. Japan Airlines, 918 F.Supp. 686, 692 (S.D.N.Y.1994). The Seventh Circuit similarly required strict compliance under section 1608(a) in Alberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense De La Carne, 705 F.2d 250, 253 (7th Cir.1983). In that case, noting that section 1608(a) \u201cdelineates the \u2018exclusive procedures\u2019 for effecting service of process upon a foreign state,\u201d the court refused to excuse the plaintiffs service on the Nicaraguan Ambassador in lieu of the head of the foreign affairs ministry.

The district court properly granted summary judgment because Birnberg\u2019s attorney fee order was enforceable and the district court lacked jurisdiction to entertain Pozos\u2019 challenges to the ALJ\u2019s underlying decision. See Thompson v. Potashnick Constr. Co, 812 F.2d 574, 576 (9th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>).

AWSD bases its argument on a novel reading of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Maples v. State, 110 N.M. 34, 791 P.2d 788 (1990). In Maples, the Supreme Court held that on procedural matters such as time limitations for appeals, rules adopted by the Supreme Court governing limitations period for appeal to the judiciary from workers\u2019 compensation deci sions prevail over an inconsistent statute. Id. at 36, 791 P.2d at 790. AWSD argues that Section 72-7-1 is such an inconsistent statute and that AWSD was therefore required to comply only with the requirements set out in Rule 1-074 to perfect its appeal to the district court.

The other defendants later joined in this motion. 4 . Although we reach the same result as the trial court, we do so taking a different route. \"Ordinarily, an appellate court will not affirm a summary judgment by ruling on a ground not ruled upon by the trial court.\u201d Thomas v. City of Annapolis, 113 Md.App. 440, 450, 688 A.2d 448 (1997); see also Gresser v. Anne Arundel County,-Md.-, -, -A.2d - (No. 20, Sept. Term, 1997, slip op. at 9, filed Jan. 28, 1998). \"If the alternative ground is one as to which the trial court had no discretion, however, summary judgment may be affirmed.\u201d Thomas, 113 Md.App. at 450, 688 A.2d 448; see also Maryland Cas. Co., 100 Md.App. at 357-58, 641 A.2d 924 (<HOLDING>). In this case, the trial judge would have had holding where an appellate court affirms trial courts grant of summary judgment on a particular ground the appellate court need not discuss the remaining groundsholding that an appellate court may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground appearing in the record even if the circuit court did not rely on itholding that the trial court may not grant summary judgment on a ground not raised in the motionholding that if the trial court would have had no discretion to deny summary judgment on an alternative ground the appellate court can on that alternative ground sustain the order granting summary judgmentholding that trial court may not grant summary judgment on ground not presented by movant in writing & \n\nHowever, it ruled Dougherty\u2019s testimony about appellant\u2019s alleged hearsay statements was inadmissible because the evidence failed to establish the reliability of those statements. Appellant contends sufficient corroborating evidence established the reliability of the proffered statements and, thus, that the trial court erred in excluding them. We hold the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the testimony of the hearsay declarant\u2014appellant\u2014was unavailable. Because appellant had complete control over his own availability as a witness, we hold that he failed as a matter of law to prove his testimony was unavailable, and we conclude the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit the statements was not error. See Perry v. Commonwealth, 280 Va. 572, 581-82, 701 S.E.2d 431, 436-37 (2010) (<HOLDING>). \u201c \u2018[T]he sufficiency of the proof to holding that appellate court in affirming trial courts decision may rely in part on a ground not presented to trial courtholding that despite a trial courts failure to make specific factual findings an appellate court is free to affirm on any grounds for which there is sufficient record to permit conclusions of lawholding an appellate court is not limited to the grounds offered by the trial court in support of its decision and may affirm on any ground on which additional factual findings are not requiredholding that an appellate court may affirm a grant of summary judgment on any ground appearing in the record even if the circuit court did not rely on itholding that an appellate court may affirm the result reached by a district court on alternative grounds & \n\nthe warrant. Rather, according to the trial court, the express terms of the warrant \"through inadvertence\u201d did not permit as extensive a search as was actually conducted. Thus, it appears the actual basis for the trial court's ruling was that the search exceeded the scope of a valid warrant. 3 . We do not here address the question of whether an appellee may raise an argument in defense of the lower court\u2019s judgment when that argument was not presented in the lower court. We do note, however, that our previous opinions on that question have been somewhat inconsistent. See, e.g., Buehner Block Co. v. UWC Assocs., 752 P.2d 892, 894-95 (Utah 1988) (applying argument raised for first time on appeal to affirm lower court\u2019s decision); American Coal Co. v. Sandstrom, 689 P.2d 1, 4 (Utah 1984) (<HOLDING>); L & M Corp. v. Loader, 688 P.2d 448, 449-50 holding that 1252d1 bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below and of general issues that were not raised below but not of specific subsidiary legal arguments or arguments by extension that were not made belowholding that arguments not raised below are waived for appealholding that petitioners had abandoned arguments not raised belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding that an issue not properly preserved below in the district court is generally waived & \n\nonly relies on a self-serving affidavit. Consistently, the Supreme Court has held that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c) requires \u201cadequate time for discovery\u201d before granting summary judgment. Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Anderson, 477 U.S. at 250 n. 5, 106 S.Ct. 2505 (stating that \u201csummary judgment be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition\u201d). The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment. See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548; see also Americable Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, 129 F.3d 1271, 1274 (D.C.Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nEstate of Stephenson, 243 Neb. 890, 503 N.W.2d 540 (1993). In reviewing a question of law, an appellate court reaches a conclusion independent of the lower court\u2019s ruling. In re Estate of Stull, supra, citing Goff-Hamel v. Obstetricians & Gyns., P.C., 256 Neb. 19, 588 N.W.2d 798 (1999). ANALYSIS On appeal, Muff and Lauridsen argue that the county court erred in awarding Thomsen fees because there is no such office as an attorney for an estate and, secondly, because at all times Thomsen was proceeding contrary to Tucker\u2019s expressed desires and wishes. Ordinarily, the right of an attorney to compensation for his or her services depends upon a contract of employment, express or implied. In re Estate of Stull, supra. See, also, Doyle v. Union Ins. Co., 209 Neb. 385, 308 N.W.2d 322 (1981) (<HOLDING>). In Doyle v. Union Ins. Co., supra, the holding that attorneys claim for professional services against person sui juris or against property of such person must rest upon contract of employment express or implied made with person sought to be charged or with his agentholding that under the applicable statutory provisions a person need not be impoverished or devoid of all assets to qualify as an indigent sick person but only that the person be unable to pay for necessary medical careholding that burglary may qualify as offense against person if as committed it is in fact a crime against a personholding that a person is seized for purposes of article i section 7 of the hawaii constitution when a police officer approaches that person for the express or implied purpose of investigating him or her for possible criminal violations and begins to ask for informationholding that the person who travels as an agent of person defrauded is a victim & \n\nas far as I can surmise, is to bar successive petitions when lower courts, but not the Supreme Court, have held a rule not to be \u201cnew\u201d under Teague because dictated by their own precedent, cf. Dyer v. Calderon, 151 F. 3d 970, 993-995 (CA9) (en banc) (O\u2019Scannlain, J., dissenting) (rejecting proposition that lower court decisions can establish rule for Teague purposes), cert. denied, 525 U.

United States, 430 U.S. 188, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1976) (<HOLDING>). 25 . In Fullilove, the Court was faced with holding of fragmented court may be viewed as that position taken by those members who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest groundsrecognizing that this court may affirm summary judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the motion justiceholding where movant asserts several grounds in support of its summary judgment motion and the trial court does not specify the grounds on which judgment was granted the reviewing court can affirm the judgment if any of the grounds are meritoriousholding that when a fragmented court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five justices the holding of the court may be viewed as that position taking by those members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest groundsholding of the court is the position taken by member who concurs in the judgment on the narrowest grounds & \n\n. Appellants' own testimony at trial confirms that they experienced various health problems with the dairy herd in 2004, in addition to the unusual fluctuations in milk production which Appellants do not dispute. See supra note 6. We therefore accept the trial court's findings concerning the timing and nature of the property damage sustained by the dairy herd. As the Superior Court admirably noted, it is not the role of an appellate court to reweigh the evidence. 13 . The Superior Court\u2019s discussion of the multiple trigger theory of liability in Consulting Engineers was central to its trigger of coverage analysis in that case, and therefore carries precedential value given this Court\u2019s adoption of that court\u2019s opinion. See Commonwealth v. Tilghman, 543 Pa. 578, 673 A.2d 898, 904 (1996) (<HOLDING>). 14 . Even if we agree with Appellants that holding that notwithstanding the above and beyond language on the disposition form the discussion at resentencing revealed that the trial court understood its obligation to and its intent to give the defendant credit for time servedholding where an appellate court affirms trial courts grant of summary judgment on a particular ground the appellate court need not discuss the remaining groundsholding that appellant waived the issue on appeal by not raising it in its opening brief even though the lower courts decision was based on that pointholding that the trial court had no jurisdiction to modify its final order more than 30 days after its final judgmentholding that when this court per curiam affirms on the basis of the lower courts opinion it not only signals agreement with the result but also with the rationale employed in reaching its final disposition on matters essential to its holding & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\nthe appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Consequently, we affirm the convictions. Affirmed. 1 . In ruling on the propriety of a trial court\u2019s decision on a motion to suppress, the appellate court considers the evidence introduced at the suppression hearing and at trial. See, e.g., Beasley v. Commonwealth, 60 Va.App. 381, 385 n.1, 728 S.E.2d 499, 501 n.1 (2012). The Court views that evidence in the light most favorable to the party who prevailed below, in this case the Commonwealth. E.g., id. 2 . As Land approached, the appellant \"jump[ed] out ... of the car.\u201d The officer \"instructed him to get back into the vehicle,\u201d and the appellant complied. 3 . The appellant\u2019s assignment of error also notes that Detective Fraser observed the traffic inf 258, 127 S.Ct. 2400, 2407, 168 L.Ed.2d 132 (2007) (<HOLDING>). 5 . The appellant cites no controlling or holding that like burglary car theft is a crime that often involves the use of weapons and other instruments of assault that could jeopardize police officer safety and thus justifies a protective frisk under terry to ensure officer safetyholding that it is reasonable that a police officer at the scene of an investigation will not let people move around in ways that could jeopardize his safety and discussing the various ways an officer may limit such movementholding that police officer did not exhibit reckless disregard for safety and wellbeing of others by negligently causing auto accident where officer looked both ways at intersection even though view was partially blockedholding that when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that illegal drugs are in the vehicle the officer may in the absence of factors allaying his safety concerns order the occupants out of the vehicle and pat them down briefly for weapons to ensure the officers safety and the safety of othersholding officer may search vehicle for weapons if officer has reasonable belief based on articulable facts that officer or another may be in danger & \n\nthe custody arrangement in this matter, and we affirm that order. In addition, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it found Colleen in contempt and ordered her to pay attorney fees. 1 94 Nev. 79, 575 P.2d 585 (1978). 2 Rust v. Clark Cty. School District, 103 Nev. 686, 688, 747 P.2d 1380, 1382 (1987); see also Smith v. Emery, 109 Nev. 737, 740, 856 P.2d 1386, 1388 (1993); Huneycutt, 94 Nev. at 80, 575 P.2d at 585. 3 Rust, 103 Nev. at 688-89, 747 P.2d at 1382. 4 Kantor v.

Other courts have reached similar conclusions in child custody matters. See, e.g., Daniel v. Daniel, 42 P.3d 863, 867 n.6 (Okla. 2001) (<HOLDING>); Decker v. Decker, 440 S.E.2d 411, 412 (Va. holding that temporary order amounted to order modifying custody of children because language changed custody for an indefinite periodholding that the lower court should have entered a final order on custodyrecognizing that an appeal does not divest the lower court from making a provisional or temporary custody order during the appeals pendencyholding that the pendency of a petitioners federal habeas corpus petition does not divest a trial court of jurisdiction to address a pcra petitionholding that since district court of appeal properly found that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule on a 3850 motion during the pendency of a direct appeal the district court of appeal should have vacated the order rather than affirming on the merits & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa. R.A.P. 302(a), \u201c[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Edmondson, 553 Pa. 160, 718 A.2d 751, 753 (1998); Commonwealth v. Dennis, 548 Pa. 116, 695 A.2d 409, 411 (1997) (\u201c[I]f appellate courts were to consider issues not raised in the trial court, then the trial would become a dress rehearsal ....\u201d) (citing Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Company, 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114, 116 (1974)); Commonwealth v. Jones, 248 Pa.Super. 214, 375 A.2d 63, 65-66 (1977) (<HOLDING>). Because appellant did not preserve the issue holding that the failure to object to a trial courts instruction constitutes waiverholding that plaintiffs failure to object to the improper comments of defendant during closing arguments resulted in waiver of plaintiffs right to argue the issue on appeal because the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issueholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that failure to object to trial courts refusal of further instruction to jury during deliberation results in waiver of issue on appealholding failure to object in timely fashion at trial results in waiver of issue for appeal & \n\nease \u2014 at least not in the first instance. It is up to the Board, not ' the courts, to make labor policy. See Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers v. NLRB, 736 F.2d 1559, 1566 n. 5 (D.C.Cir.1984) (\u201cBecause requiring unions ... to have full time organizers present during each labor campaign raises serious questions of labor policy, it is an issue for the Board, not the courts, to settle.\u201d). Moreover, it is irrelevant that the court agrees with the Board\u2019s decision: \u201cWe emphasize that we harbor no disagreement with the Board\u2019s policy choices. We ask only for a clear statement of what those choices and the reasons for them are.\u201d Sullivan Industries, 957 F.2d at 905 n. 12; cf. Securities & Exchange Comm\u2019n. v. Chenery Corp., 318 U.S. 80, 94-95, 63 S.Ct. 454, 462-63, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we remand this ease to the Board holding that court can affirm administrative order only on grounds on which agency relied and noting that the orderly functioning of the process of review requires that the grounds upon which the administrative agency acted be clearly disclosed and adequately sustainedrecognizing that this court may affirm summary judgment on grounds other than those relied upon by the motion justiceholding that a motion for administrative reconsideration which congress did not order the agency to entertain which the agency dismissed in relevant part on procedural grounds and which the petitioner filed over sixty days after the agency acted cannot effectively extend retroactively the thirtyday period congress specified for judicial review petitionsholding we may affirm on any grounds supported by the record even those not relied upon by the district courtholding where movant asserts several grounds in support of its summary judgment motion and the trial court does not specify the grounds on which judgment was granted the reviewing court can affirm the judgment if any of the grounds are meritorious & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nbut instead to his \u201cirresponsibility.\u201d Id at 18. Findings of the District Court Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), trial courts should and must \u201cstate legal and factual conclusions sufficient to give an appellate court a clear understanding of the grounds of its decision.\u201d White Indus., Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 845 F.2d 1497, 1499 (8th Cir.1988). If an appellate court does not know what facts the trial court took into consideration in drawing its conclusions, its findings become suspect. See Atlantic Thermoplastics Co. v. Faytex Corp., 5 F.3d 1477, 1479 (Fed.Cir.1993) (remanding because the district court\u2019s findings were \u201ctoo conclusory and sparse\u201d to provide a factual basis for appellate review); EEOC v. United Va. Bank\/Seaboard Nat\u2019l, 555 F.2d 403, 406 (4th Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>). The only critical fact the district court holding that it is the commissioners findings of fact to the extent they modify or replace the administrative law judges findings that are relevant on appealholding that a reviewing court has the power to reject the findings and conclusions of the trial court where the findings are not supported by the evidenceholding that appellate review is precluded when the trial court provides only conclusory findings illuminated by no subsidiary findings or reasoning on all the relevant factsholding that as long as the findings are supported by substantial evidence the board must defer to the hearing committees credibility determinations because they are subsidiary findings of basic factsholding the findings of fact required to support an alimony award are sufficient if findings of fact have been made on the ultimate facts at issue in the case and the findings of fact show the trial court properly applied the law in the case & \n\nerror in the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion. This assignment of error is without merit. II. THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE JURY WAS SELECTED \u00b6 7. Robinson assigns error to the trial court\u2019s method of jury selection. Robinson\u2019s only claim rests on a vague recitation of Rule 4.05(2) of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court without any additional argument or citation to authority in support thereof. Robinson maintains a full panel of accepted jurors was not tendered to him after the State exercised its first round in the jury selection. Robinson is incorrect and misinterprets the selection procedure outlined in URCCC 4.05(2). Under URCCC 4.05(2) a full panel of jurors, meaning twelve, are tendered by the State after electing to exer , 113 L.Ed.2d 411 (1991) (<HOLDING>), neither of which are applicable to the holding that generally an unsworn statement by counsel is not evidence in the context of a batson hearingholding that evidence of the same name and that the former conviction was in same city and same court as the present case and the fact that the defendant did not offer any testimony to rebut the prima facie evidence of identity was sufficient to establish identityholding that probation does not constitute a sentenceholding that a defendants confirmation of a psrs findings does not waive a challenge on appeal where there is no conceivable strategic reason for not objecting to a sentence at a higher offense levelholding that racial identity between the objecting defendant and the excluded jurors does not constitute a relevant precondition for a batson challenge & \n\nCURIAM. Based upon the scant record before us, which does not include a transcript of the proceeding below or an appropriate substitute, we cannot conclude that the lower court abused its discretion when it entered a final judgment of dismissal. For this same reason, we also cannot find that the order denying appellant\u2019s motion to set aside final judgment, due to the appellant\u2019s failure to appear for the duly scheduled trial of this cause and\/or failure to contact the court or opposing counsel requesting a continuance was an abuse of discretion.

The protection provided by section 16-8-107(1) should not have been addressed by the court of appeals. The general rule is that failure to make a timely and sufficient objection during the trial constitutes a waiver of that ground on appeal. Larkin v.

Nothing in Green\u2019s EEOC charge related to incidents of harassment, nor did anything mention the dates on which they occurred. Because the facts alleged in Green\u2019s EEOC charge form cannot be said to encompass a hostile work environment claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s finding that his claim was therefore procedurally deficient. See Sanchez, 431 F.2d at 466 (explaining that a Title VII complaint may encompass only the kinds of discrimination like or related to the allegations contained in the EEOC charge). Unlike Title VII, \u00a7 1981 does not require that a plaintiff exhaust administrative remedies before filing an action in federal court. See Caldwell v.

See Vega v. Hernandez, 381 F.Supp.2d 31, 38 (D.Puerto Rico 2005). A public employer who fails to make an adequate investigation of an employee\u2019s sexual harassment complaint can be held liable under Title VII for hostile work environment created by another of its employees under negligence theory, without regard to effectiveness of employer\u2019s remedial action.

Boumehdi v. Plastag Holdings, LLC, 489 F.3d 781, 788 (7th Cir.2007).

In fact, this allegation does not even support her theory of the case. Following the Jeffers\/Perry email episode, the Agency in fact responded to complaints about insulting emails in the workplace and took corrective measures \u2014 it sent around an office-wide memorandum about inappropriate emails and hired the Littler Mendelson firm to investigate the matter. However, plaintiff complains nonetheless because she disagrees with the way in which it remediated the problem. 10 .

In the context of a Title IX sexual-harassment claim, \u201cthe plaintiff \u2018must always' prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations,\u2019 but in fact constituted discrimination \u2018because ... of sex.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)); see, e.g., id. at 67 (affirming dismissal of Title IX claim \u201c[i]n the absence of conduct cre 1st Cir.2002) (affirming jury finding of sexually hostile work environment where female plaintiff was subject to \u201chumiliating sexual remarks and innuendos\u201d on a daily basis for over a year);, Winsor v.

Catalyst Technology, Inc., 302 F.3d 474, 478 (5th Cir.2002). If this determination is answered in the affirmative, the court must decide whether the challenged conduct meets the applicable standards for either a quid pro quo or hostile environment claim. For example, same-sex harassment that is \u2018severe or. pervasive\u2019 enough to create a hostile environment ... might be excluded from the coverage of [T]itle VII because it was not discriminatory on the basis of sex. On the other hand, same-sex harassment that is indisputably discriminatory might not be serious enough to make out either a quid pro quo or hostile environment claim. Id. (citation omitted). See, e.g., Davis v. Coastal Int\u2019l Security, Inc., 275 F.3d 1119, 1126 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The Court\u2019s first task is to determine holding that transsexuals are not a protected class under title vii in response to the plaintiffs argument that because a persons identity as a transsexual is directly connected to the sex organs she possesses discrimination on this basis must constitute discrimination because of sexrecognizing that a plaintiff can demonstrate that samesex harassment is because of sex by showing that the conduct was motivated by the coworkers sexual desire for persons of the same sexholding that retaliation claim was reasonably related to prior sex discrimination claimholding discrimination based on pregnancy was not sex discriminationholding that actions of plaintiffs coworkers which included slashing plaintiffs tires grabbing their crotches and making kissing gestures and uttering a phrase used to describe oral sex however vulgar did not constitute discrimination because of sex & \n\nthe second element of her sexual harassment claim, in relating how she was harassed, plaintiff claims that she was harassed because Herron and Lohse instructed co-workers to \u201ckeep track of\u2019 plaintiff and that rumors about her were discussed at work. Dkt. 58 at 19. Plaintiffs claim that Herron and Lohse instructed co-workers to \u201ckeep track of\u2019 her is conclusory. Moreover, even if this allegation were proved, plaintiff claims that defendant\u2019s actions were covert. It is unclear how plaintiff was \u201charassed\u201d by those actions if she was not even aware of them. With respect to the third element of her claim, plaintiff is unable to show that the alleged harassment was \u201cbecause of\u2019 her sex. See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 118 S.Ct. 998, 1002, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998) (<HOLDING>).

Green Tree Credit Corp., 159 F.3d 759, 765 (2d. Cir.1998) (internal citations and quotations omitted). In this regard, a claim for hostile work environment, \u201cwill not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period.\u201d Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106, at. Acts occurring outside the limitations period that are significantly far apart from each other are \u201cfatal\u201d to a continuing violation argument. See Quinn, 159 F.3d at 766 (<HOLDING>).

Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in awarding IOV2 percent interest on the judgment rather than the statutory rate, and reverse and remand this portion of the judgment with instructions to amend the award by applying the statutory rate. Prejudgment interest on costs Appellants maintain that the district court order can be read to require prejudgment interest on the award of costs since it provides that interest on the entire judgment should be awarded from the date of service of the complaint. First, appellants argue that interest should not be awarded on costs at all. See National Educators Life Insurance Company v.

Accordingly, Durham\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees is denied. VII. Conclusion 98. On Plaintiffs claims under \u00a7 113(f)(1) of CERCLA, the Court awards Plaintiff, The Durham Manufacturing Company, $116,075.65 against Defendant Merriam Manufacturing Company, and $19,345.94 against Defendant Allan E. Adams, plus post-judgment interest. 99. The Court further awards Plaintiff pre-judgment interest, accruing from the latter of the date on which Plaintiff made demand for payment on the Defendants or the date of the expenditure. See Goodrich Corp., 311 F.3d at 177 (<HOLDING>). The Plaintiff is directed to submit a holding that prejudgment interest may include compound interestholding that award and rate of prejudgment interest are within trial courts discretionholding that an award of prejudgment interest under 113f of cercla is mandatoryholding that the state circuit court did not have the authority to award prejudgment interest for matters occurring prior to arbitration awardholding summary rejection of request for interest was not an abuse of discretion under indcode 345147 which states the court may award prejudgment interest as part of a judgment & \n\nto it, Massachusetts law does not provide for prejudgment interest to be included in uninsured motorist arbitration awards. However, as mentioned above, we have specifically held that arbitrators have the authority to award prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits and \u201cthat; arbitrators should add prejudgment interest to their awards unless the parties specifically provide otherwise by agreement.\u201d Sentry, 556 A.2d at 1000 (quoting Paola, 461 A.2d at 937) (emphasis added). Thus, we hold that defendant\u2019s argument that the arbitrator- awarded on a matter not submitted to him has no merit. Furthermore, we hold that any argument that defendant makes pursuant to the application of Massachusetts law was waived because it was not submitted to the arbitrator. See Aponik, 844 A.2d at 706 (<HOLDING>). The defendant admitted in the trial court and holding defendant liable for attorneys fees when the guaranty contract at issue provided for the payment of collection costs and expensesrecognizing that an award of temporary attorneys fees and costs is based on an assessment of need and ability to pay as well as the reasonableness of the fees and costsholding that the failure to request attorneys fees and costs during arbitration waived any rights provided by the mechanics lien statuteholding that where the arbitration agreement was silent on feesplitting and the costs imposed upon the plaintiff by the aaa were not prohibitive the plaintiff had presented little evidence to indicate that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive and the fees and costs of arbitration did not render the arbitration scheme unconscionableholding that oncors request for the trial judge rather than the jury to determine the reasonableness of its attorneys fees and the failure to submit the question of attorneys fees to the jury resulted in a waiver of oncors claim for the recovery of attorneys fees & \n\n899 P.2d 1004. \u201cA claim becomes liquidated when both the amount due and the date on which it is due are fixed and certain, or when the same becomes definitely ascertainable by mathematical computation.\u201d Kilner v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 252 Kan. 675, 686, 847 P.2d 1292 (1993). Prejudgment interest is not recoverable when damages \u201care not ascertainable by computation, based on some fixed standard of measurement.\u201d Foster v. City of Augusta, 174 Kan. 324, 332, 256 P.2d 121 (1953). In most tort cases, prejudgment interest is not appropriate under K.S.A. \u00a7 16-201 because the amount of damages due a plaintiff are not \u201cfixed and certain\u201d until a jury resolves questions of fact and the court enters judgment. See, e.g., Whittenburg v. L.J. Holding Co., 838 F.Supp. 519, 519 (D.Kan.1993) (<HOLDING>); Torre v. Federated Mutual Ins. Co., 906 holding that because liquidated damages under the adea are punitive in nature a jurys award of state punitive damages and adea liquidated damages constitutes a double recovery and therefore reducing the total recovery by the amount of the liquidated damages awardholding that prejudgment interest should not be added to damages awarded for misrepresentation because the amount of damages were not liquidated or ascertainable before the verdictholding that the amount of damages in a sex discrimination case was in dispute until the court entered judgment on the jury verdict the sum was not liquidated for ksa 16 201 purposesholding that where the amount of damages was the primary issue in dispute the plaintiffs claim for damages was not liquidated until the date the jury returned its verdict and the plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest under ksa 16 201holding that prejudgment interest is based on the amount of the judgment not the total amount of damages awarded by the jury because nonsettling defendants have no control over settlement negotiations and should not be forced to pay prejudgment interest on settling defendants parts of a damages award & \n\ntaxable. In reaching this conclusion, we place considerable emphasis on the nature of the funds that the Commissioner found taxable. Section 104(a)(2) excludes from taxation \u201cthe amount of any damages received ... on account of personal injury or sickness.\u201d (emphasis supplied). Language is not infinitely elastic, and here, the disputed prejudgment interest simply does not comprise \u201cdamages\u201d within the meaning of section 104(a)(2). We explain briefly. Under the applicable Rhode Island statute, prejudgment interest is awarded in all civil cases, not just in personal injury cases. See R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 9-21-10. This interest is separate and distinct from damages, and is awarded mainly to compensate for delay in payment. See Foster v. Quigley, 94 R.I. 217, 179 A.2d 494, 495 (1962) (<HOLDING>); accord Balian v. Allstate Ins. Co., 610 A.2d recognizing private right of actionholding that the right to drive is not a fundamental rightrecognizing that a person has been seized within the meaning of the fourth amendment only if in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leaveholding that the fourth amendment right implicated in a malicious prosecution action is the right to be free of unreasonable seizure of the personholding that prejudgment interest for damages to the person is not of the substance of the right of action but exclusively an incident attached thereto by legislative fiat after such right has been adjudicated & \n\nthat only rules of damages are substantive. Prior to Monessen, the United States Supreme Court had already decided that prejudgment interest is a form of \u201cactual damages\u201d and that damages are substantive. See id. Thus, no further analysis was needed to determine that prejudgment interest was substantive. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has found other state laws that have no relationship to damages to be substantive in FELA cases. See, e.g., Dice v. Akron, Canton & Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S. 359, 363, 72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398 (1952) (concluding that the right to have a jury decide factual issues of fraud is \u201ctoo substantial a part of the rights accorded by [FELA] to permit it to be classified as a mere local rule of procedure\u2019 \u201d); Brown, 338 U.S. at 299, 70 S.Ct. 105 (<HOLDING>); White, 238 U.S. at 511-12, 35 S.Ct. 865 holding that state courts must apply the federal pleading standard in fela casesholding that in diversity cases federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural lawholding that litigants may enforce fela in state courts as a matter of right but also observing that state courts are free to apply their own modes of procedure to fela casesrecognizing that the federal pleading standard is a less stringent standard than the delaware pleading standardholding that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity cases & \n\nwhich the award of sanctions .under \u00a7 14-10-129.5 is based. See Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 14-10-129.5(2)(b) (\u201cthe court, in the best interests of the child, may issue orders which may include ... [modifying the previous order to meet the best interests of the child ... [and] [ajwarding to the aggrieved party, where appropriate, actual expenses ... \u201d) (emphasis added). Under these circumstances, most courts hold that fees \u201cinextricably intertwined with proceedings affecting the welfare of the child,\u201d such as custody and visitation, should be deemed support. In re Peters, 133 B.R. at 295; see also Dellapa v. Vazquez (In re Vazquez), 92 B.R. 533, 535 (S.D.Fla.1988) (fees awarded in litigation over visitation, custody, contempt and child support nondischargeable); In re Farrell, 133 B.R. at 147-48 (<HOLDING>); In re Poe, 118 B.R. at 812 (fees incurred in holding that a debt for attorney fees incurred by an exspouse in a postjudgment divorce contempt proceeding was nondischargeableholding that in a chapter 7 case postpetition interest on a nondischargeable tax claim is also nondischargeableholding that a challenge to part b determinations in an order involving both part a and part b must begin in district courtholding that an outofwedlock childs pending claim for retroactive child support was nondischargeable in bankruptcy because a debt for child support arises upon the birth of the child and that the fact that no court had yet ordered the debtor to support the child does not take the debt outside the scope of 11 usc 523a5holding nondischargeable fees imposed in part to punish debtor for disobeying court order in proceeding to compel return of child & \n\nrelief,\u201d on breach of fiduciary duty and equitable estoppel theories for making affirmative misrepresentations with knowledge beneficiary would be misled thereby, and stating that to \u201csucceed under this [equitable es- toppel] theory of relief, an ERISA plaintiff must establish (1) a material misrepresentation, (2) reasonable and detrimental reliance upon the representation, and (3) extraordinary circumstances.\u201d The Court of Appeals concluded employer breached its fiduciary duties, affirmatively misled the beneficiary and her participating spouse, and awarded the beneficiary an additional $150,000 on a supplemental accidental death and dismemberment policy that the participant spouse would have opted to purchase had he known all of the material facts); Bixler, 12 F.3d at 1301-03 (<HOLDING>); Gillis v.

Moskowitz therefore violated his duty of disclosure under ERISA and his conduct gives rise to liability under \u00a7 1132(c)(1). Because the award of penalties is committed to the sound discretion of the Court, I must determine whether Moskow-itz\u2019s conduct warrants imposition of such a penalty. In determining whether to assess a penalty under \u00a7 1132(c)(1) courts have considered such factors as bad faith or intentional conduct on the part of the administrator, the length of the delay, the number of requests made and documents withheld, and the existence of any prejudice to the participant or beneficiary. See Ziaee v. Vest, 916 F.2d 1204 (7th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied 499 U.S. 959, 111 S.Ct. 1581, holding that in exercise of its discretion district court may consider factors such as number of requests made and number of documents withheldholding that district court may consider documents referred to in plaintiffs complaint and central to his claimrecognizing that district court in exercise of its rule 16b discretion may consider other relevant factors including in particular whether allowing the amendment of the pleading at this stage of the litigation will prejudice defendantsholding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that a district court may depart upward based upon a significant number of fraudulent schemes conducted by the defendant & \n\nother equitable relief, costs, and attorneys fees (Doc. 115) is granted in part and denied in part as follows: plaintiff shall recover from defendant back pay in the amount of $8,063, with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $1,363; plaintiffs costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; compensatory damages as found by the jury in the amount of $1,000; pecuniary damages as found by the jury in the amount of $12,000; and punitive damages as found by the jury in the amount of $20,000. 1 . 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. 2 .

In accord with the guidance set forth in Metropolitan Life, courts have found that the complete preemption doctrine\u2014 i.e. preemption under \u00a7 502(a) \u2014 permits removal of state law causes of action in a multitude of different ERISA-related circumstances. See Dukes, 57 F.3d at 355 (citing Metro. Life Ins. Co., 481 U.S. at 63-67, 107 S.Ct. 1542 (<HOLDING>); Anderson v. Elec. Data Sys.

See, e.g., Khalaf v. Williams, 814 S.W.2d 854, 858 (Tex.App.Houston [1st Dist.] 1991, no writ). The relief must also be consistent with the allegations in the petition, however. Id.; Hardin v.

The Copyright Act Standard The Copyright Act protects original works of authorship fixed in a tangible medium of expression. See 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102 (1994). Although copyright does not extend to ideas, procedures, processes, systems, or methods of operation, it is well established that the protection encompasses software. See Computer Management Assistance Co. v. Robert F. DeCastro, Inc., 220 F.3d 396, 400 (5th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). A copyright owner possesses the exclusive holding that copyright protection of computer programs extend beyond the programs literal code to their structure sequence and organizationholding that while the computer program at issue was within the subject matter of copyright the right sought under state law pursuant to a license was not equivalent to the exclusive rights under copyright as such copyright preemption did not applyholding that because literary works including compilations and derivative works are within the subject matter of copyright state common law that purported to protect a work for which plaintiffs copyright action was unsuccessful was preemptedholding that prejudgment interest ordinarily should be awarded on damages pursuant to claims under the copyright act of 1909 17 usc 1 et seq 1976 ed superceded by the copyright act of 1976 17 usc 101 et seqrecognizing that the copyright act was amended in 1976 to include computer programs in the definition of protectable literary works & \n\nin its discretion may allow the recovery of full costs by or against any party.... Except as otherwise provided by this title, the court may also award a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee to the prevailing party as part of the cost. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. The Supreme Court has provided a list of non-exclusive factors a court may consider in determining whether either party should receive attorney fees, including, \u201cfrivolousness, motivation, objective unreasonableness (both in the factual and legal components of the case) and the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.\u201d Fogerty v.

In the case of pre-award protests, we have repeatedly limited standing under \u00a7 1491 to those bidders who have a \u201csubstantial chance\u201d of securing the award and who have been disadvantaged by the government procurement decision they challenge. In Rex Service Corp. v. United States, we held that a contractor did not have standing because it did not \u201cestablish that it had a \u2018substantial chance\u2019 of receiving the contract\u201d and thus \u201cprove a direct economic interest as a putative prospective bidder.\u201d 448 F.3d 1305, 1308 (Fed.Cir.2006); see also Statistica, Inc. v.

If it involves the NLRA and another federal statute, then the Garmon doctrine is inapplicable as a general rule unless the underlying federal claim is illegal only by way of the NLRA. That is, if the defendant\u2019s conduct is perfectly legal but for the proscriptions of the NLRA, then those determinations of potential illegality should be left to the expertise of the NLRB. Likewise, if the conduct in question is federally chargeable independent of the NLRA (even if it is also arguably covered by the NLRA), then the Garmon doctrine does not apply because the two implicated federal statutes may both be given their intended purpose. See, e.g., Smith v. Nat\u2019l Steel & Shipbuilding Co., 125 F.3d 751, 754-57 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

With respect to the latter requirement, the Supreme Court has held that [a] private plaintiff may not recover damages under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act merely by showing \u201cinjury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market.\u201d Instead, a plaintiff must prove the existence of \u201cantitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d Atlantic Richfield Co., 495 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1884 (quoting Brunswick Corp. 429 U.S. at 489, 97 S.Ct. 690 (internal citations omitted)); see also J.

United States, 52 Fed.Cl. 599, 603 (2002). In contrast, parties who sue as shareholders, with no independent stake in the outcome other than through their ownership interest in the corporation, are not in privity of contract and have no basis to allege injury for breach. See Glass v.

But in federal-question cases, the identity of the parties is irrelevant and the district court\u2019s jurisdiction is grounded in the federal question(s) raised by the plaintiff. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The jurisdictional requirement, therefore, prevents the enlargement of federal jurisdiction in such cases only where a proposed intervenor seeks to bring new state-law claims.

We do not presume to draft precise disclaimers for each of appellants\u2019 four claims; we leave that task to the agency in the first instance. Nor do we rule out the possibility that where evidence in support of a claim is outweighed by evidence against the claim, the FDA could deem it incurable by a disclaimer and ban it outright. For example, if the weight of the evidence were against the hypothetical claim that \u201cConsumption of Vitamin E reduces the risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d the agency might reasonably determine that adding a disclaimer such as \u201cThe FDA has determined that no evidence supports this claim\u201d would not suffice to mitigate the claim\u2019s misleadingness. Cf. FTC v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 778 F.2d 35, 42-43 (D.C.Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>).

There is nothing talismanic about the phrase \u201cprocedural harm.\u201d A party claiming under that r\u00fabric is not relieved from compliance with the actual injury requirement for standing. See, e.g., Munoz-Mendoza, 711 F.2d at 425-26 (requiring, as a precondition to standing, that plaintiffs who allege procedural harm also show \u201cinjury in fact\u201d). Thus, one who asserts procedural harm as the basis for standing must set forth particulars that serve to indicate a distinct and palpable injury. Warth, 422 U.S. at 501, 95 S.Ct. at 2206. Put bluntly, a party must set forth a sufficient panoply of facts to show that his injury is real as opposed to being theoretical or abstract. See Capital Legal Found. v. Commodity Credit Corp., 711 F.2d 253, 258 (D.C.Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>).

In other words, the Virginia Act would in no way foreclose the availability of a federal maritime tort claim to plaintiff until plaintiff himself elected to subject himself to the Virginia Act\u2019s exclusivity provision by affirmatively availing himself of its benefits. Such a mode of analysis might not implicate federalism and Supremacy Clause concerns so much as questions of the limits of contract, release, and waiver: i.e., whether an injured worker may contract effectively to waive his right to bring a federal maritime tort claim in exchange for access to supplemental state disability benefits. But see, e.g., Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., 370 U.S. 114, 131, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962) (<HOLDING>).

As a result, the alleged implied message could not be proven false. In any event, even if PBM\u2019s \u201ccompare to\u201d messages were false, the district court correctly concluded that Mead Johnson cannot prove that the \u201ccompare to\u201d language caused any damages.

If the government were correct that X-Citement Video announced a new rule, this would provide an additional ground for our conclusion that the cause and prejudice requirement does not apply. We have consistently permitted defendants to challenge their convictions in \u00a7 2255 motions, where there has been an intervening change in the law after the time for direct appeal has run. See, e.g., Sood, 969 F.2d at 775 (defendants pled guilty and did not challenge their convictions until post-conviction collateral proceedings); see also Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 16, 104 S.Ct. 2901, 2910, 82 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (<HOLDING>). 14 .The district court shall enter an order holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim alleged to be cause for the procedural default of other claims is itself an independent claim subject to the procedural requirements of exhaustionholding that the novelty of a petitioners claim can constitute cause for a procedural defaultholding prosecutorial misconduct claim barred by procedural defaultholding that a federal court may excuse a state habeas petitioners procedural default if the petitioner can show cause for the failure to raise the claim and prejudice resulting from such failureholding judicial recusal claim barred because of procedural default & \n\nthe Supreme Court limited in Finley. In Finley, the plaintiff was attempting to bring non-federal defendants into a federal action based on a statute which is explicitly written to allow jurisdiction over only federal defendants. In the case at bar, a defendant is attempting to join a third- party defendant under the impleader rule which explicitly allows such an inclusion. The justice of the impleader rule is that it allows a defendant, who is itself in federal court against its will, to bring in parties who in fact may be more responsible to the plaintiff. Id. at 204-205. Further, the Sixth Circuit has recently applied the Finley rule to a situation with a \u201cposture\u201d or \u201ccontext\u201d analogous to the present case. See Stallworth v.

In contrast to this ease, in Short the Claims Court found jurisdiction under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, not the Indian Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505. See Short, 12 Cl.Ct. at 40 (\u201c[Plaintiffs are suing as individuals under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491 (1982).\u201d).

See 516 U.S. 489, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). Although Varity interpreted \u00a7 1132(a)(3) to authorize individual suits, its holding is not as broad as Wilson contends. The Supreme Court ruled that an individual can sue under \u00a7 1132(a)(3), but he or she must: (1) only seek equitable relief, and (2) have no more specific means of relief available. See Varity, 516 U.S. at 508-15, 116 S.Ct. 1065; Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, 127 F.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1997). Wilson\u2019s claim seeks damages in the amount of the rehabilitation expenses, not injunctive relief. Furthermore, the remedy for a claim that a plan participant\u2019s benefits were improperly denied is specifically provided for in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). See Turner, 127 F.3d at 200 (<HOLDING>).

CRE 103; People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965 (Colo.App.1983). Kruse, 819 P.2d at 551 (Van Cise, J., dissenting). We agree with Judge Van Cise. The protection provided by section 16-8-107(1) should not have been addressed by the court of appeals. The general rule is that failure to make a timely and sufficient objection during the trial constitutes a waiver of that ground on appeal. Larkin v. People, 177 Colo. 156, 160, 493 P.2d 1, 3 (1972); People v. Browning, 809 P.2d 1086, 1088 (Colo.App.1990).

But this argument also was not raised in arbitration and thus is also waived. The USPS urges that this argument is not waivable because it is based on due process and the civil service statutes; thus, if upheld, this argument would render the CBA and the Joint Statement unenforceable on public policy grounds. Our precedent does not support this position, however. See Dist. 17, 179 F.3d at 140 (finding waiver of First Amendment claim not raised during arbitration); see also AAOT Foreign Econ. Ass\u2019n (VO) Technostroyexport v. Int\u2019l Dev. & Trade Servs., Inc., 139 F.3d 980, 981-82 (2d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). We therefore hold that the decision of the holding that party waived public policy challenge by failing to raise it during arbitrationholding that the defendant waived an argument by failing to raise it in his appellants briefholding that appellant waived issue by failing to raise it in opening briefholding that party waived argument by failing to brief it on appealholding that a party abandoned an issue by failing to raise it in the opening brief & \n\nthey present no argument that we have not already addressed. 41 . The class-certification order\u2019s certification of the rule 42(b)(1)(A) class also mandates notice and sets forth opt-out provisions, 42 . To the extent LSRC\u2019s fifth issue contains other one-sentence complaints that we have not addressed elsewhere, these- complaints are waived. See Tex. R. App. P. 38.1(i) (requiring appellant\u2019s brief to \"contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record\u201d); Fredonia State Bank v.

Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Because there is no evidence in this case holding that plain error review is appropriate unless there is some evidence that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of a particular argumentholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nWhile McIntyre appears to have applied strict scrutiny, this Court does not find that the result differs under the exacting scrutiny standard. Simply stated, the inherent worth of speech in terms of its capacity to inform the public does not depend upon the identity of its source, at least in the context of referenda. The Defendants argue that the McIntyre holding is a very \u201cfact-specific\u201d and should yield to the more recent and relevant stream of Supreme Court cases. (Defs.\u2019 Br. Opp. Pl.\u2019s Mot. Summ. J. 4-5.) However, the Defendants do not fully develop this argument, and this Court has no obligation to formulate arguments for a party. See Spath v. Hayes Wheels Int\u2019l\u2014 Ind., Inc., 211 F.3d 392, 397 (7th Cir.2000); See also, United States v. Berkowitz, 927 F.2d 1376, 1384 (7th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). As highlighted in Swaffer, the only notable holding that the seventh circuit has made clear that perfunctory and undeveloped arguments and arguments that are unsupported by pertinent authority are waived even where those arguments raise constitutional issuesholding that arguments not raised in district court are waivedholding that an attorneys arguments are not evidenceholding that claims must put parties on sufficient notice of underlying arguments or arguments are deemed waivedholding that appellate courts will not review undeveloped and unsupported arguments & \n\n496, 745 P.2d 717, 721 (Ct.App. 1987). In this case, Plaintiff filed a pretrial motion to exclude the assailant from being considered a concurrent tortfeasor. The motion cited Lujan v. Healthsouth Rehabilitation Gorp., 120 N.M. 422, 902 P.2d 1025 (1995), the same authority Plaintiff relies on in this appeal. Plaintiff thus fairly invoked a ruling of the trial court on this issue and preserved it for appeal. See id. (explaining liabilities of concurrent and successive tortfeasors). {36} We are unpersuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to preserve this issue by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on comparative negligence. In so contending, Defendants rely on Pittard v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 101 N.M. 723, 729, 688 P.2d 333, 339 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>), and Romero v.

On appeal, Amquip argues the trial court also erred in denying: its motion for summary judgment, the admission into evidence of depositions, and its motion for a continuance. 2 . Amquip contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its request to admit deposition transcripts into evidence and in denying its motion for continuance when it was unable to get the deposition transcripts into evidence. As mentioned previously, those issues are moot because this case is reversed on the denial of the right to a trial by jury. 3 . Although Vercon contends Amquip waived its right to a jury trial by participating in a nonjury trial, this argument relates to whether Amquip preserved the issue for appeal. See Crespo v. Crespo, 28 So.3d 125, 128 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) holding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a claim was not preserved for review where the defense failed to object on the specific grounds advanced on appealholding that the defendant waived the issue on appeal when he failed to contemporaneously object to the admission of such evidence at trialholding exwifes claim regarding admission of parol evidence was not preserved for appeal because she failed to object to the evidence or to having an evidentiary hearing & \n\nevidence, Jacob moved for judgment as a matter of law, arguing that no evidence had been presented which would support a finding that his injuries were caused by anything other than Amtrak\u2019s negligence. The District Court reserved decision. Because Jacob failed to renew his motion within ten days of the entry of final judgment, as is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b); Williams v. Guzzardi, 875 F.2d 46, 50 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989). In his reply brief, Jacob argues that even if he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law, we should nonetheless review his sufficiency of the evidence argument and, if we find that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, grant a new trial. Id. (<HOLDING>). But cf. Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d holding that even when a defendant moves under rule 50 at the close of plaintiffs evidence and autocentro did not even do that if a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the posttrial stage with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidenceholding that defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law which was denied by the district court when they made it at the close of the evidence limited the relief the appellate court could grant to a new trialholding in a capital case that the defendant waived his argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue where the trial court took the motion under advisement but the defendant failed to seek a ruling on the motion and failed to renew the motion after the jurors had been qualifiedholding that the defendants insufficientevidence claim was barred by his failure to renew his rule 29 motion at the close of all the evidence because there was no manifest miscarriage of justiceholding that an appellate court should not undertake to review whether a plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when the only motion filed and the only motion on appeal was the trial courts grant of summary judgment & \n\nargue that the arbitrator must make that decision. Because the court already determined that the arbitrator must decide whether this matter may proceed on a class or collective basis (doc. 62 at 8), defendants contend that the court also must hold that it is the arbitrator who must decide whether the effective vindication exception applies to invalidate the arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs never respond to this argument in their Reply. Doc. 68. Arguably, their failure to do so amounts to a waiver of this issue. See In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015, 1100-01 (10th Cir. 2014) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument because their reply brief was silent on an issue and made no attempt to rebut the respondents\u2019 argument); see also Cayetano-Castillo v. Lynch, 630 Fed.Appx. 788, 794 (10th Cir. 2015) (<HOLDING>) (quoting Hardy v. City Optical, Inc., 39 F.3d holding that an appellant who does not respond to an argument in its reply brief waives as a practical matter anyway any objections not obvious to the court to specific points urged by the appellee because the court is not required to do his work for him and dissect the appellees plausible argumentholding that if an appellee raises an argument not addressed by the appellant in its opening brief the appellant may reply citation omittedholding that a reviewing court must address an appellees reply as to preservation of error and an alternative argument in an appellees replyholding a party waives an argument made for the first time on replyholding that an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief is waived & \n\nthe warrant. Rather, according to the trial court, the express terms of the warrant \"through inadvertence\u201d did not permit as extensive a search as was actually conducted. Thus, it appears the actual basis for the trial court's ruling was that the search exceeded the scope of a valid warrant. 3 . We do not here address the question of whether an appellee may raise an argument in defense of the lower court\u2019s judgment when that argument was not presented in the lower court. We do note, however, that our previous opinions on that question have been somewhat inconsistent. See, e.g., Buehner Block Co. v. UWC Assocs., 752 P.2d 892, 894-95 (Utah 1988) (applying argument raised for first time on appeal to affirm lower court\u2019s decision); American Coal Co. v. Sandstrom, 689 P.2d 1, 4 (Utah 1984) (<HOLDING>); L & M Corp. v. Loader, 688 P.2d 448, 449-50 holding that 1252d1 bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below and of general issues that were not raised below but not of specific subsidiary legal arguments or arguments by extension that were not made belowholding that arguments not raised below are waived for appealholding that petitioners had abandoned arguments not raised belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding that an issue not properly preserved below in the district court is generally waived & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\na statutory argument that Shepard and Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) should be applied to a district court\u2019s categorization of a particular prior conviction for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1 (i.e., whether the conviction was a drug offense, a crime of violence, and not related to the other conviction), or how the district court should arrive at that categorization when sentencing under an advisory guidelines system. Thus, he has waived that argument. See United States v. Duncan, 400 F.3d 1297, 1299 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to address the Booker implications of firearm and role enhancements because appellant did not challenge those enhancements in his initial brief); see also Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., 270 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). AFFIRMED. 1 . Compare United States v.

Pool v. Ford Motor Co., 715 S.W.2d 629, 635 (Tex.1986). Initially, we note that the jury was asked to determine Grace\u2019s damages for the breach of contract the court had found. The question was worded as follows: What sum of money, if any, if paid now in cash, w pp.Houston [14th Dist.] 2008, no pet.)

III. EiToneous Factual Basis for Sentencing Petitioner next contends that his sentence was based, in part, on an erroneous understanding of the facts. Specifically, Petitioner asserts that the Government erroneously informed the court that Petitioner told the probation officer that he had previously transported drugs into the State of Hawaii. Petitioner further claims that the court relied on this false information in determining Petitioner\u2019s sentence. Petitioner did not raise this argument when he appealed his conviction. Where a defendant fails to raise a non-constitutional challenge to his sentencing on direct appeal, the claim is deemed waived. See United States v. Schlesinger, 49 F.3d 483, 485 (9th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). In such a circumstance, the court may only holding that errors not raised before the trial court will not generally be considered on appealholding that this court follows the rule that nonconstitutional sentencing errors that have not been raised on direct appeal have been waived and generally may not be reviewed by way of 28 usc 2255holding claims must be raised on direct appeal or waivedholding ineffectivetrialassistance claim may be brought in 28 usc 2255 proceeding regardless of whether claim could have been raised on direct appealholding that nonconstitutional claims that could have been raised on direct appeal may not be asserted in a collateral proceeding & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v. Thompson, 710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983))); McRae v. United States, 420 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nthis court held that Rule 11(e)(2) \u201cdirects counsel to provide this court with all evidence relevant to the issues raised on appeal.\u201d Id. at 1002.

In this case, defendant failed to provide this court with a transcript of the March 8 entrapment hearing, which it was his responsibility to do. See Utah R.App.P. 11(e)(2). \u201cTherefore, our review is strictly limited to whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusions of law and judgment.\u201d Sampson, 770 P.2d at 1002; accord State v. Garza, 820 P.2d 937, 938-39 (Utah App.1991) (<HOLDING>).

Furthermore, it is appropriate for a district court to consider the substantial increase in turnout of black voters that usually follows the creation of an opportunity district in its effectiveness analysis. See United States v. Euclid City Sch. Bd., 632 F.Supp.2d 740, 765 (N.D. Ohio 2009) (\"[I]t is unreasonable to assume that minority turnout will not increase under a system in which that turnout is made meaningful, relative to a system in which that turnout was entirely ineffective.\u201d) With the boost in turnout of black voters the district becomes substantially more effective. 188 .

Moreover, he had the benefit of two attorneys\u2019 thoughts concerning the post-conviction petitions. We note parenthetically that the attorney who initially drafted one of the petitions, and reviewed the record in Stewart II, did not choose to raise any claim regarding Mr. Pumilia\u2019s alleged incompetency. More significantly, defendant did not even raise this issue in his briefs filed with this court appealing the denial of his post-conviction petitions. Our Supreme Court Rule 341(e)(7) provides that points not asserted in an appellant\u2019s brief are waived and shall not be raised for the first time, as defendant did here, during oral argument. 107 Ill. 2d R. 341(e)(7); see also People v.

See Garcetti, 547 U.S. at 418, 126 S.Ct. 1951 (<HOLDING>). Association Claim The gravamen of this claim holding if an employee does not speak as a citizen on a matter of public concern the employee has no first amendment cause of action based on his or her employers reaction to the speechholding that the plaintiffs speech was not constitutionally protected because it was made in his official capacity and there was simply no evidence that he was speaking as a citizen on a matter of public concernholding that an employee engages in protected activity under the first amendment when he threatens to file a lawsuit on a matter of public concernholding that if the speech in question does not address a matter of public concern there is no first amendment violationholding that the absence of a motivating desire to address a matter of public concern was not dispositive as to whether the speech addressed a matter of public concern & \n\nv.

If a plaintiff has alleged these three elements, the public employer may still avoid liability if it shows that the plaintiffs speech was likely to disrupt the government\u2019s activities to an extent that outweighs First Amendment value of the speech. Mandell, 316 F.3d at 382-83; see also Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968) (explaining that court must balance the interests of the employee \u201cas a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees\u201d); Cobb, 363 F.3d at 102.

Because all the speech for which Anemone recognizing a public employees first amendment right to address matters of legitimate public concernholding public employees conduct and expression in internal investigation of employees at county prosecutors office to expose potential wrongdoing constituted matter of public concernholding that employees allegation of corrupt and wasteful practices at municipal hospital obviously involved matter of public concernholding that employees voluntary testimony is also inherently a matter of public concernholding that the absence of a motivating desire to address a matter of public concern was not dispositive as to whether the speech addressed a matter of public concern & \n\nof public concern is Gardetto\u2019s public support of the three non-incumbent candidates for positions on EWC\u2019s board of trustees. One of the primary functions of a L.Ed.2d 201 (1992). Thus, we hold that Gardetto\u2019s endorsement of the three insurgent candidates for the college\u2019s board positions involves speech on a matter of public concern. Similarly, we hold that Gardetto\u2019s statements criticizing Mason for holding himself out as a \u201cdoctor\u201d when he did not have a Ph.D. or other doctoral degree involves speech on a matter of public concern. The integrity, qualifications, and misrepresentations of a highly visible public official, such as the president of a college, obviously impact the social and political life of a commu nity.

Alternatively, Markwell claims that his alleged action is immunized based on the Noerr-Pennington doctrine. See Def. Mot. to Dismiss (d\/e 14) at 15. The Noerr-Pennington doctrine provides that \u201cparties may petition the government for official action favorable to their interests without fear of suit, even if the results of the petition, if granted, might harm the interests of others.\u201d See Tarpley v. Keistler, 188 F.3d 788, 794 (7th Cir.1999).

Joliet, 491 F.3d 717, 722 (7th Cir.2007). The Seventh Circuit has extended the Noerr-Pennington doctrine to government officials as well. See id. at 721-22 (7th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>).

But the subject matter of the conversation at issue here is far removed from that in situations where the media publicizes truly private matters. See Michaels v.

Supp. 2d 823, 841-842 (CD Cal. 1998) (broadcast of videotape recording of sexual relations between famous actress and rock star not a matter of legitimate public concern); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R.

The government\u2019s first defense is that the Act does not implicate the First Amendment at all; rather, it regulates conduct that is outside the First Amendment. According to the government, the Act leaves plaintiffs free to engage in any form of protected speech they choose. In many respects the government is correct. The Access Act does not prohibit protestors from prayin S.Ct. 2538, 2546-47, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Finally, certain physical obstructions, such as a blockade of pedestrian traffic, are not protected by the First Amendment. See Cameron v. Johnson, 390 U.S. 611, 617, 88 S.Ct. 1335, 1339, 20 L.Ed.2d 182 (1968) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the Act does target unprotected holding that under 521 the coercive force applied against a plaintiff must result in an interference with a separate constitutional or statutory right and it is not sufficient that the right interfered with is the right to be free of the force or threat of force that was appliedholding that the plaintiffs right to political speech is fully in accord with the publics interest in free speech and associationholding that shortterm and sporadic interference with free exercise rights does not violate the first amendmentholding that to the extent compliance with the flsa interferes with the state budgetary process that interference is caused by state law not federal lawholding that a statute which prohibited unreasonable interference with access to a courthouse was a valid law and the fact that free speech is intermingled with such conduct does not bring with it constitutional protection & \n\nviewpoint or race. It is important to examine the proffered justifications for a college\u2019s selective denial of recognition to an organization. See Healy v. James, 408 U.S. at 184-85, 92 S.Ct. at 2347-48.

For instance, a state law placing conditions on public access to arrestees\u2019 home addresses is not subject to a facial challenge on free speech grounds because the government is under no obligation to make those addresses public at all. Id. Here, however, CNS asserts its First Amendment right of access to judicial and other public proceedings. See Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise II), 478 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2735, 92 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986).

Balancing of Harm and Public Interest Similarly, it is doubtful that the balancing of harm and public interest warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that even minimal interference with the First Amendment freedom of the press causes an irreparable injury. See, e.g., Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v.

The D.C. Circuit has neither recognized nor rejected that the First Amendment affords the public a right of access to civil proceedings. The government interprets the D.C. Circuit\u2019s silence as a denial of the right. Quoting Ctr. for Nat\u2019l Sec. Studies v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, the government argues that the D.C.

In Ctr. for Nat\u2019l Sec.

Conclusion Because plaintiffs were \u201cconfidential employees\u201d in the Bmnti sense, the First Amendment did not protect them from dismissal because of their political loyalty to the defendant\u2019s political adversary, so the summary judgment for defendant is AFFIRMED. 1 . 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). 2 . 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. 3 . 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976). 4 .

See LiMandri v. Judkins, 52 Cal.App.4th 326, 337, 60 Cal.Rptr.2d 539 (1997). As plaintiffs do not allege the existence of a fiduciary relationship or that Ford made any representations about its ignition locks, only the second and third of the above-referenced circumstances are implicated here, and, as set forth above, both require a finding of \u201cmateriality.\u201d See, e.g., Oestreicher v.

In contrast, IVGID has historically limited access to the beaches to certain persons for recreational uses only because it is required to do so by the restrictive covenant. The beaches here are similar to properties where the government has restricted access or only allowed the public to use portions for limited, non-expressive purposes.

The plaintiff also asserts that the defendant failed to provide to him his 2013 Within Grade Increase Notice. However, the plaintiff only requested the 2014 Within Grade Increase Notice in his FOIA request. See Def.\u2019s Mot., Def.\u2019s Facts 1. Furthermore, the Court is baffled by the plaintiff\u2019s assertion, given that he provided the Court with the requested 2013 Fiscal Year Acceptable Level of Competence Form, See Pl.\u2019s Compel Mot, I at 23. Accordingly, because the production of any 2013 Within Grade Increase Notice falls outside of the scope of the defendant\u2019s obligations under the FOIA, see Larson v. Dep\u2019t of State, 565 F.3d 857, 869 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (<HOLDING>); see also Truitt v.

See Tex. A & M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 840 (Tex.2007). We strictly construe a statute authorizing an interlocutory appeal because it is an exception to the general rule that only final judgments are appealable. Id. at 841. To appeal pursuant to section 51.014(a)(5), the appellant must be \u201can individual who is an officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision of the state.\u201d See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.014(a)(5). Rogers does not argue that he is a state employee or that he otherwise contracted with a governmental entity to perform governmental duties. See id.; see also Knowles v. City of Granbury, 953 S.W.2d 19, 24 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1997, pet. denied) (<HOLDING>). We therefore limit our inquiry to whether holding that private party can assert official immunity if it contracted with a public official to perform governmental dutiesholding that where a public official takes discretionary action that the official knows will directly benefit a financial interest that the official has concealed in violation of a state criminal law that official has deprived the public of his honest services under 1346holding that if official has violated clearly established law he is entitled to qualified immunity only if reasonable official could have believed conduct was lawfulholding police officer is a public officialholding that a state official can be held individually hable under 1983 for acts taken within the scope of his or her official duties & \n\nis the default sanction once a court determines that the party\u2019s failure was neither substantially justified nor harmless. In Design Strategy, the Second Circuit applied the four-factor test when considering an argument that the district court had improperly excluded certain evidence, and affirmed the district court\u2019s conclusion \"that sanctions, including severe sanctions, were warranted.\u201d 469 F.3d at 296-97. In other words, the Circuit referred to the four Patterson factors to assess the correctness of the district court\u2019s \u201csubstantially justified or ... harmless\u201d inquiry; it reviewed the district court\u2019s decision to preclude not as such, but because under Rule 37(c)(1) that decision was, in the district court\u2019s view, the logical consequence of its finding th d 1222, 1244 (D.N.M.2011) holding that plaintiff was not prejudiced by defendants failure to disclose documents before her deposition because she had a unique familiarity with documents at issueholding that when a plaintiff attaches documents to her complaint containing statements by the defendant that conflict with the plaintiffs allegations the plaintiff is not required to adopt every word in the documents as trueholding that the agency did not have an obligation to search for and produce the documents the plaintiff claimed entitlement to because the plaintiffs foia request gave no indication that she sought those particular documentsholding that pursuant to the best evidence rule trial testimony relying on documents was inadmissible without submission of such documents or an explanation as to why the documents were unavailableholding that admission of one defendants deposition was proper where she was present at the deposition even though she was represented at the time by the same counsel as her codefendants & \n\nbetween Long Creek, Little River, Limehouse, and Lake Wylie, the Court can attest that the factual premise of Rickborn\u2019s argument is an understatement. Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 25, 2014) (stating the rule applies \u201c \u2018if doubt exists as to the extent or fact of coverage\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buddin v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967)) (emphasis added)). As this Court has explained, exclusion A.7 is not ambiguous on the issue of whether a pickup is a private passenger auto. Cf. Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\nJJ., concur. 1 . On appeal, Amquip argues the trial court also erred in denying: its motion for summary judgment, the admission into evidence of depositions, and its motion for a continuance. 2 . Amquip contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its request to admit deposition transcripts into evidence and in denying its motion for continuance when it was unable to get the deposition transcripts into evidence. As mentioned previously, those issues are moot because this case is reversed on the denial of the right to a trial by jury. 3 . Although Vercon contends Amquip waived its right to a jury trial by participating in a nonjury trial, this argument relates to whether Amquip preserved the issue for appeal. See Crespo v. Crespo, 28 So.3d 125, 128 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) holding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a claim was not preserved for review where the defense failed to object on the specific grounds advanced on appealholding that the defendant waived the issue on appeal when he failed to contemporaneously object to the admission of such evidence at trialholding exwifes claim regarding admission of parol evidence was not preserved for appeal because she failed to object to the evidence or to having an evidentiary hearing & \n\nto counsel. Of course, it could be said that Clark can hardly complain about the district court\u2019s grant of his own motion. But, because the court\u2019s discretion to deny a request for self-representation requires the court to consider the defendant\u2019s interest, I would conclude that a defendant who makes such a motion, against the advice of or without the support of his appointed counsel ke a searching inquiry of Clark\u2019s reasons for wanting to dismiss his present counsel. , On their face, Clark\u2019s claims that counsel had not visited him in jail, had not discussed the case with him, would not seek out suggested witnesses, and would not have the gun checked for fingerprints, raised serious questions that required inquiry. See, e.g., United States v. Morrissey, 461 F.2d 666, 669 (2d Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The majority suggests that Clark\u2019s claims do holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to substitute counsel on the strength of gonzalezs sworn responses at the pleataking that no one was threatening him or forcing him to plead where the defendant alleged that his attorney forced him to plead guilty and threatened him if he did not take the pleaholding even when a request for an attorney is ambiguous it is incumbent upon law enforcement to seek clarification of the ambiguity before denying the statutory right to counselholding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding that an ambiguous mention of an attorney is not a request for counselholding that a defendants claim that his attorney did not meet with him or seek out witnesses required a searching inquiry before denying the request for new counsel & \n\na multidistrict litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d) proceeding for the purpose of conducting coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in cases involving injuries allegedly caused by Ortho Evra. With respect to the removing Defendants\u2019 request for a stay, it generally is not the Court\u2019s practice to allow cases in which the existence of subject matter jurisdiction is seriously at issue to remain pending long in federal court. The legal questions presented by the instant motion for remand are hardly novel ones for the Court, and they are quite as susceptible of resolution here as they are in the MDL court. See Weese v. Union Carbide Corp., Civil No. 07-581-GPM, 2007 WL 2908014, at *1 (S.D.Ill. Oct.3, 2007) (quoting Conroy v. Fresh Del Monte Produce, Inc., 325 F.Supp.2d 1049, 1054 (N.D.Cal.2004)) (<HOLDING>). Turning then to the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 holding that filing of appeal to federal circuit divests this court of jurisdiction to consider motion to stay court order pending appealrecognizing that pleadings filed in federal court while the federal court has jurisdiction become part of the state court record on remandholding that it would be judicially inefficient to stay proceedings so that a motion for remand could be resolved by a transferee court given that tjhis court is as qualified to evaluate the factors establishing federal jurisdiction as any other federal courtholding that certification of a remand order divests federal court jurisdictionholding that a transferee federal court should apply its interpretations of federal law not the constructions of federal law of the transferor circuit & \n\nSee also United States v. Horak, 833 F.2d 1235, 1245 (7th Cir.1987). In United States v.

The Court reasoned that such an appeal was permitted under Section 3731 because the district court\u2019s order was \u201c \u2018tantamount to a dismissal of the indictment ...,\u2019 though not labeled a dismissal.\u201d 702 F.2d at 670, quoting United States v.

Apex Distributing Co., 270 F.2d 747, 750 (9th Cir.1959) (<HOLDING>). We too hold that in the case before us the holding that a sufficiency challenge must be preserved in the trial court in a parental termination case to be reviewed on appealholding that an issue must be presented to the lower court and the specific legal argument or ground to be argued on appeal must be part of that presentation if it is to be considered preservedholding that the point on appeal and the objection in the trial court must be the same in order for it to be preserved for appealholding that a petitioner must specify which issues form the basis of the appealholding that the direction the governments appeal must take or whether it may appeal at all is to be governed by the substantial basis of the orders sought to be reviewed rather than their designation and form & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v.

On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nor issues remanded.\u201d United States v. Moore, 131 F.3d 595, 597-98 (6th Cir.1997) (internal citations omitted). \u201c[A]bsent explicit limitations in the appellate court\u2019s mandate, an order vacating a sentence and remanding the case for re-sentencing directs the sentencing court to begin anew, so that fully de novo resentencing is entirely appropriate^]\u201d United States v.

See DeMott, 513 F.3d at 58 (<HOLDING>). We agree and hold that upon general remand, holding that states procedure providing for jury evaluation of voluntariness of a defendants confession violates fourteenth amendment due processrecognizing that deference to an agencys interpretation of the written law is appropriate only when that interpretation is within the written laws languageholding that upon resentencing providing only a written opinion violates the open court requirement of 3553cholding that school policy prohibiting written material of a religious nature violates the fust amendmentholding that 172545hs written notice requirement is mandatory & \n\nFlorida Action The majority opinion holds that for an insurer to be bound by a judgment in an action between its insured and an uninsured motorist, all that is required is that the insurer be served with a copy of the summons and complaint, and that it is not necessary for the insurer to be a party to the action. In construing a statute, this Court is required to look at the entire statute, and construe it in pari materia, giving effect, if possible, to all provisions contained in the statute. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., 358 N.C. 160, 188, 594 S.E.2d 1, 20 (2004) (noting that \u201cthis Court does not read segments of a statute in isolation. Rather, we construe statutes in pari materia giving effect, if possible, to every provision.\u201d); State v. Tew, 326 N.C. 732, 739, 392 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1990) (<HOLDING>). The second sentence of N.C. Gen.

We find that the analysis set forth by Johnson is much more compelling. Because the 1997 Amendments do not impose a mandatory minimum sentence, see infra, petitioner\u2019s reliance on Smith is misplaced. Likewise, Meeks does not apply to this case, because it dealt with sentencing statutes and not parole guidelines. See generally Newland, 714 N.Y.S.2d at 631-32 (<HOLDING>). We agree that it is reasonable to interpret holding that an amendment passed two years into a 10year automatic extension period was not effective until the 10year extension period expired and stating that to hold otherwise would render the extension provision meaninglessholding that extension of a federal grand jurys term was within the discretionary powers of the district courtholding that the extension of meeks by the smith court was inappropriateholding that an amendment of restrictive covenants passed during the running of an automatic 10year extension period was not effective until the end of the 10year extension periodholding that a district court may not construe an untimely notice of appeal as a motion for extension of time & \n\nof conviction, [and Benris] conviction[s] [are] not ripe for appeal.\u201d Ex parte Kelley, \u2014 So.3d at \u2014. Consequently, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review Benris appeal. The State appears to concede that the Alabama Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Kelley supports the position that no judgments of conviction have been entered in these cases but argues that this Court should nonetheless hold that the issuance of a sentencing order without the pronouncement in open court of a sentence is sufficient to enter Benn\u2019s judgments of conviction. In Ex parte Kelley, the Alabama Supreme Court considered the State\u2019s argument and rejected it, holding that nothing less than a pronouncement in open court of the defendant\u2019s sentence will satisfy the sentencing element of a judgment of conviction. \u2014 So.3d \u2014 (<HOLDING>). \u201c[T]his Court is bound by the decisions of holding that the trial courts oral expression in open court of its future intention to render a judgment was not itself a judgment but rather the trial courts written findings of fact and conclusions of law were its judgmentholding that the trial courts written order was not the entry of a sentence sufficient to support a determination that a judgment of conviction was enteredholding premature notice of appeal was treated as entered on date of entry of final judgmentholding that in the interest of judicial economy considering appeal from order denying posttrial motions and ordering entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff even though judgment was not actually enteredholding that because trial courts order did not dispose of the defendants counterclaim that order was not a final judgment that would support an appeal & \n\n499 F.Supp.2d 501, 514 (S.D.N.Y.2007) for the proposition that the privilege does not reach \"routine operating decisions.\u201d PL\u2019s Mem. for Mot. to Compel at 26, but it is the Mead Data opinion that has precedential value here. 7 . Even the cases the Committee cites indicate that the privilege covers agency deliberations about decisions, as well as the formulation of policy positions. In Taxation with Representation Fund v. IRS, 646 F.2d 666, 677 (D.C.Cir.1981), the Court stated, \"the privilege protects documents reflecting advisory opinions, recommendations, and deliberations comprising part of a process by which governmental decisions and policies are formulated ....\u201d See also Paisley v.

When more than one inference can be reasonably drawn, it is for the trier of fact to determine the proper one. Id. Thus, if a reasonable fact finder evaluating the evidence could draw more than one inference from the facts, and if that inference introduces a genuine issue of material fact, then the court should not grant the summary judgment motion. See Augusta Iron & Steel Works, Inc., 835 F.2d at 856. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, it is well-established that the court may neither adjudge the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the evidence. See Pita v.

Such misconduct itself might warrant dismissal if a plaintiff's financial circumstances eliminate the effectiveness of sanctions as a remedy or as a deterrent. See Herring v. City of Whitehall, 804 F.2d 464, 468 (8th Cir.1986) (\"If the party is not capable of [paying discovery sanctions], the district court should then consider other sanctions. The ultimate sanction of dismissal with prejudice should only be used when lesser sanctions prove futile.\u201d). Nevertheless, where dismissal is predicated on the nonpayment itself, as opposed to the underlying misconduct, the degree of that misconduct does not alter our analysis with respect to the significance of a party's inability to pay. See id. holding that district court abused its discretion by dismissing for nonpayment without inquiring into partys asserted inability to payholding that the decision whether to apply the exhaustion requirement in an erisa case is committed to the district courts sound discretion but that the district court abused its discretion by not dismissing the suit for failure to exhaust administrative remediesholding district court abused its discretion in admitting state court findings of factholding that the district court abused its discretion by summarily dismissing all 26 grounds in a 2255 motion where only certain claims were vague and conclusoryholding that the trial court had abused its discretion in dismissing the case without allowing appellants an opportunity to amend & \n\nlaw. The fact that the state could have adopted a Luce-type rule and warned a defendant of its consequences without violating his constitutional rights does not mean, as the majority appears to believe, that the state\u2019s violation was one of state law only. There are a number of actions a state may take without violating a defendant\u2019s federal constitutional rights if a state statute or rule provides for them l constitutional right to testify in his own defense by the trial court\u2019s unlawful threat to permit the prosecutor to introduce his prior conviction, that waiver is constitutionally invalid as a matter of federal law despite the fact that the state could have adopted such a rule constitutionally had it chosen to do so. Cf. Caputo v. Henderson, 541 F.2d 979, 982-84 (2nd Cir. 1976) (<HOLDING>). Finally, Galindo was not only unlawfully holding that it is notrecognizing that where a guilty plea is shown to be constitutionally invalid leave to withdraw the plea is constitutionally mandatedholding that a defendants guilty plea is not knowingly made and is hence constitutionally invalid and subject to reversal on habeas if it is based upon erroneous sentencing information provided by the judgeholding that the defendants guilty plea was entered into knowingly voluntarily and intelligentlyholding that a sentence is subject to reversal if the trial judge selects a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts & \n\n(7)(f) or other discovery under N.D.R.Crim.P. 16, but the defendant is not under obligation to do so. The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v. Gielen, 54 N.D. 768, 210 N.W. 971, 975 (1926), the Court stated: It may be said that while the information in this case, under the circumstances presented by the ons which have reached what appears to be the opposite conclusion. But, we have not adopted a strict compliance standard. Rather, we have interpreted the statute as a notice requirement to which the harmless error analysis applies. Cf. State v. Anderson, 303 N.W.2d 98 (N.D.1981) (<HOLDING>). The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\nclaim, even in Jack\u2019s absence. A review of the complaint indicates that Solomon has sufficiently pled the existence and deprivation of a liberty interest, satisfying the first prong to state a due process claim. As to the second prong, Solomon must allege that the deprivation did not comport with constitutionally due process. Here, his claim fails. It is true that regardless of the state\u2019s practices and procedures, \u201c[w]hat process is due\u201d is a question of constitutional law, not state law. Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). When a state seeks to deprive a child of the liberty interest in being nurtured by their parent, it must provide procedures that are fundamentally fair. See Santosky, 455 U.S. at 753-54, 102 S.Ct. 1388 (<HOLDING>). Yet, the complaint fails to satisfy the holding that state could be liable under ada for inaccessibility of company it contracted with to provide state inmates with jobsholding that state law must give way to treasury department regulations governing survivorship rights in us bondsholding that while the state must provide a defendant access to procedures for making a competency evaluation it need not shoulder the burden of proof in convincing the trier of fact that the defendant is competentholding that when the state moves to destroy familial bonds it must provide parents with fundamentally fair proceduresholding that the extradition procedures are a matter of state law & \n\ntrial court to hold an evidentiary hearing to make a factual determination as to whether Richardson\u2019s failure to appear at his sentencing was willful. At this hearing, the State bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Richardson willfully failed to appear. See Peacock v. State, 77 So.3d 1285, 1288 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citing Ingmire, 9 So.3d at 1281). If the State fails to establish willfulness, then Richardson should be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement previously accepted by the trial court. See Lowery v.

Woodford, 358 F.3d 560, 579-80 (9th Cir.2004). This case is distinguishable because, here, the prosecution specifically acknowledged that Morris, Eckstrom, and Barrett were equally guilty of Van Zandt\u2019s murder; unlike the defendant in Beardslee, Morris is situated similarly with respect to his guilt in Van Zandt\u2019s death. There would be no legal imposition of the death penalty without the ability of juries to consider mitigating evidence proffered by the capital defendant. See Gregg v.

(quoting United States v. Frierson, 945 F.2d 650, 658 (3d Cir.1991)). This is supported by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s statements in Murphy.

The state concedes that the trial court committed plain error when it imposed court-appointed attorney fees. We accept the state\u2019s concession that the trial court plainly erred in imposing attorney fees of $416 on this record. See State v. Coverstone, 260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (<HOLDING>). Further, we conclude that, for reasons holding that it is plain error for a trial court to require a defendant to pay courtappointed attorney fees in the absence of legally sufficient evidence that defendant has the ability to pay the amount imposedholding that a trial court commits plain error by imposing courtappointed attorney fees where the record is silent as to the defendants ability to pay the fees orderedholding that a trial court cannot decide the issue of attorneys fees without findings as to one spouses ability to pay and the others needholding because an award of attorney fees is discretionary court may consider attorney fees in relation to the underlying equities in the caseholding that trial court properly assessed mothers attorneys fees as necessaries against father in case in which trial court ordered father to pay mothers attorneys fees as child support but did not state that the fees were necessaries & \n\nState made no effort to distinguish Cox; in fact, the State\u2019s brief does not even cite Cox. As previously discussed, the State was required to prove that when Phares induced Daniel Walker to pay him money, Phares intended to unlawfully deprive Walker of the money, ie., to take the money without performing the agreed-upon work. See Tex. Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 31.01(3)(A), \u00a7 31.03(a); see also Wilson v. State, 663 S.W.2d 834, 836-37 (Tex.Crim.App.1984) (To prove theft, the State must show intent to deprive the complainant of property at the time the appellant accepted remuneration pursuant to the contract.). On this record, there is no evidence from which such a deceptive intent can be inferred. See Cox, 658 S.W.2d at 669-71; see also Phillips v. State, 640 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Tex.Crim.App.1982) (<HOLDING>). As in Cox and Phillips, in the case sub holding that a paywhenpaid clause does not preclude a subcontractors recovery under the miller act payment bond because the federal legislation conditions payment of the subcontractor not on payment by the government to the contractor but rather on the passage of time from completion of the work or provision of materialsholding that an assignment was recognized by the government because the government issued a check made payable to the assignee as payment under the contractholding that payment made in reasonable belief that it was required by an insurance contract was involuntaryholding that when the appellant and the complainants entered into a residential construction contract the complainants made a down payment and the defendant took measurements drew up plans but ultimately failed to perform under the contract the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant obtained the down payment by deceptionholding that it was not essential to an action by a supplier on a payment bond under the miller act that a demand be made on the general contractor for payment although there was evidence in the case from which it could be found that the materialman looked to the general contractor for payment since the statute does not require a demand for payment but merely requires written notice of the claim & \n\nwith Rule 32.6(b)\u2019s pleading requirements. Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.7(d). While the Court of Criminal Appeals refers to all three of these rules in its peitinent order, we focus our analysis on Rule 32.6(b), as Frazier\u2019s failure to provide \"full disclosure of the factual basis\u201d of the relevant claim was the sine qua non of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s dismissal. 7 . It is uncontroversial that \"[i]f the petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies that are no longer available, that failure is a procedural default which will bar federal habeas relief, unless either the cause and prejudice or the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is established.\u201d Smith v. Jones, 256 F.3d 1135, 1138 (11th Cir.2001); see also Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep't of Corr., 568 F.3d 894, 908 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Because we find no procedural default, we holding that a petitioner may overcome a procedural default by demonstrating either 1 an adequate cause for and actual prejudice arising from the default or 2 that a miscarriage of justice caused by a substantial denial of constitutional rights will occur if the petitioners federal claims are not considered quoting lynd v terry 470 f3d 1308 131314 11th cir2006holding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that trial court must make entry of default prior to entry of default judgment and court may not make entry of default when there is no default in law or in factholding that a federal court may excuse a state habeas petitioners procedural default if the petitioner can show cause for the failure to raise the claim and prejudice resulting from such failureholding that the novelty of a petitioners claim can constitute cause for a procedural default & \n\nspecific acts indicating that propensity. Although the State does not advance this argument in its brief, it might be claimed that the defendant had done so by giving direct testimony in which he indicated that he \u201cwould\u201d not \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d \u201cever\u201d have hired someone to kill his mother or have told Pope that it was \u201cokay\u201d to kill her. However, we do not believe that such \u25a0 ambiguous statements, which appear to have been made in the context of attempting to show that the defendant had a close and loving relationship with his mother, and, hence, no motive to kill her, can be fairly construed as an unequivocal assertion of good character that would justify cross-examination about prior violence against others generally. Compare United States v. Collier, 29 M.J. 365 (C.M.A.1990) (<HOLDING>), with State v. Guritz, 134 Or.App. 262, 894 holding that discharge of a police officer for the choice to enter into a relationship with the wife of his superior officer on the force was rationalholding that defendants constitutional right to travel was not abridged when he was ordered not to make contact with the victim he attempted to rapeholding that a defendants answer on direct examination that he would have at eased if ordered to do so by a particular superior officer was not an unequivocal assertion that he possessed the character trait of obedience to orders because the defendants answer could be explained by showing a special relationship to that superior officerholding suspects contradictory answers on miranda waiver form that he would answer questions without an attorney and that he wanted to talk to a lawyer to be ambiguousholding that although jury found officer not to have had probable cause for arrest officer was entitled to immunity because law was not clearly established as to circumstances in which officer found himself & \n\nSaulpaugh whole, its failure to apply a compound rate of interest to its calculation of damages constituted an abuse of discretion. See Clarke, 960 F.2d at 1153. On remand, however, the district court may wish to deny interest for specific years if it concludes that a delay in the litigation was the result of dilatory tactics by the plaintiff. We leave this determination to the district court in the first instance. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Saulpaugh the remedy of front pay. The award of front pay is discretionary, and where as here the district court makes a specific finding that an award of back pay was sufficient to make a plaintiff whole, no abuse of discretion can be found. Cf. Barbano v. Madison County, 922 F.2d 139, 147 (2d Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). V. Reasonable Attorneys\u2019 Fees Saulpaugh next holding that it is within the courts discretion to award both reinstatement and punitive damages for violation of 2114 although finding that the district courts decision not to award such remedies did not constitute an abuse of discretionholding that an award of compensation for future lost earnings or front pay is an equitable matter for the court not the juryholding that failure to award front pay because the district court impliedly found that other relief was sufficient did not constitute an abuse of discretionholding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to deny an award of attorneys fees to the wife & \n\nUnited States v. Leachman, 309 F.3d 377, 381-83 (6th Cir.2002); United States v. Burns, 298 F.3d 523, 544 (6th Cir.2002). Thus, in the present case, where petitioner\u2019s 70-month concurrent sentences fall well below the twenty-year maximum sentence authorized for each bank robbery count by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), and, in pleading guilty, petitioner admitted to the factual allegations used to calculate his sentence, his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel falls short under the first prong of the Strickland standard. Moreover, as the government notes, petitioner does not otherwise claim that in pleading guilty, he did not understand his appeal rights, and nowhere in his petition does he argue or demonstrate that he directed counsel to pursue an appeal. See Regalado, 334 F.3d at 525 (<HOLDING>). The self-serving affidavit filed by Hicks\u2019 recognizing that defendant must show 1 that counsels performance was deficient and 2 that counsels errors prejudiced the defenseholding that counsels failure to object to use of an inapplicable controlled substance conviction tb enhance a sentence under 4b11 is deficient performance under stricklandholding that criminal defense counsels failure to file notice of appeal when requested to do so is per se ineffective assistanceholding that counsels failure to file appeal was not deficient performance under strickland where the petitioner in 2255 action did not direct counsel to file an appeal and acquiesced in counsels decision to pursue as an alternative a reduction in sentenceholding that the strickland test applies to claims that counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nsettlement, the insurer may be liable to the insured to pay the verdict rendered against the insured even though the verdict exceeds the policy limit of liability. The reason for this rule is that the insurer \u2018may not gamble\u2019 with the funds of its insured by refusing to settle within the policy limits.\u201d); Delaney v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 947 F.2d 1536, 1547 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cGeorgia law is clear that in a case in which a liability insurer defending a claim brought against its insured refuses, in bad faith, an offer to settle within the policy limits, and an excess judgment is entered against the insured, the insured may recover the amount by which the judgment exceeds the policy limits.\u201d);c\/ Trinity Outdoor, LLC v. Central Mut. Ins. Co., 285 Ga. 583, 679 S.E.2d 10, 13 (2009) (<HOLDING>). To Nationwide\u2019s predictable chagrin, it is holding that insured cannot bring an action against its insurer for bad faith failure to settle a claim in the absence of an excess verdictholding action by judgment creditor of insured against insurer for bad faith failure to settle claim against insured not a direct action within section 1332c provisoholding that insured may recover attorneys fees from insurer where insurer acts in bad faithholding that a negligence claim against an insured and a bad faith claim against the insurer are not separate as the first must be proved to prevail on the secondholding that insured was not required to suffer an excess judgment before it could sue its excess insurer and primary insurer for bad faith failure to settle where it was alleged the insurers arbitrarily refused to settle and insured was required to pay 1 million in settlement to avoid near certainty of larger judgment that would exceed all available coverage & \n\ncreate such a doubt, it is material even if it would not convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was the killer. Under the circumstances presented by the record before us, we cannot be confident that the result of Harrington\u2019s murder trial would have been the same had the exculpatory information been made available to him. We hold, therefore, that Harrington\u2019s due process right to a fair trial was violated by the State\u2019s failure to produce the police reports documenting their investigation of an alternative suspect in Schweer\u2019s murder. See Mazzan, 993 P.2d at 74-75 (finding Brady violation where withheld \u201cpolice reports provided support for [the defendant\u2019s] defense that someone else murdered\u201d the victim); Davis v. Commonwealth, 25 Va.App. 588, 491 S.E.2d 288, 293 (1997) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s holding that the prosecutions failure to disclose information regarding a witnesss past cooperation with law enforcement did not constitute a brady violation in light of other impeachment evidence in the record including testimony regarding the witnesss extensive drug use and past cooperation with the deaholding claim based on failure to disclose information to the epa preemptedholding prosecutions failure to disclose information of other africanamerican females in vicinity of drug sale constituted a brady violationholding as brady violation prosecutions failure to disclose to defense that prosecution had agreed not to prosecute key witness in exchange for his testimony at trialholding that the failure to disclose evidence known to the defense cannot form the basis of a brady violation & \n\n"}

If the government were correct that X-Citement Video announced a new rule, this would provide an additional ground for our conclusion that the cause and prejudice requirement does not apply.

See, e.g., Sood, 969 F.2d at 775 (defendants pled guilty and did not challenge their convictions until post-conviction collateral proceedings); see also Reed v.

After reviewing the record and considering the claims Burns is attempting to raise in his \u00a7 2254 petition, we reject his argument that applying the limitations period in this case renders the habeas remedy inadequate or ineffective. See Miller v. Marr, 141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998).

DISCUSSION The denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate presents a mixed question of law and fact, and we review the district judge\u2019s factual conclusions for clear error and questions of law de novo. Rhode v. United States, 583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and, consequently, must be construed liberally. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). District judges must resolve all claims for relief raised in habeas proceedings, regardless of whether relief is granted or denied. Clisby, 960 F.2d at 935-36 (involving a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition filed by a state prisoner); Rhode, 583 F.3d at 1291 (<HOLDING>). When a district judge fails to address all of holding 2254 applies to administrative proceedingsholding that 60day time limit for notice of appeal in civil cases not 10day limit in criminal cases applies to 2255 proceedingsholding that exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture proceedingsholding that res judicata applies in deportation proceedingsholding clisby applies to 2255 proceedings & \n\nhabeas federal district court failed to consider the substance of the statutory defense coded at ... \u00a7 25 ... when [it] deferred to the state [court\u2019s] ... dismissal .... \u201d); and 3 (\u201cThe federal district court[\u2019s] procedural ruling erred in determining that the State courts had made an \u2018adequate\u2019 determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d). We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\n460, 463 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cEquitable tolling is proper only when extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d), petition for cert. filed, \u2014 U.S.L.W. -, \u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. June 11, 2001) (No. 00-10520). Because Hatcher filed his habeas petition over two years past the required date for a timely petition, the appeal is untimely and we are barred from reviewing it on the merits. In addition to being untimely, all of the arguments contained in Hatcher\u2019s appeal (except for the District Court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing) have been defaulted by his failure to raise them on direct appeal or in state post-conviction proceedings. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Hatcher admits that he procedurally defaulted holding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that federal courts must defer to independent and adequate state procedural bars in reviewing 2254 petitionsholding that 15a1419a3 is an independent and adequate state ground for a state courts finding of procedural defaultholding that rule 322a is an adequate and independent procedural barholding that in reviewing trial courts ruling on habeas corpus petition reviewing court must defer to all of trial courts implied factual findings supported by record & \n\npretrial proceedings, Defendant was repeatedly advised of the risks he faced by choosing to proceed without counsel. Nevertheless, Defendant unequivocally maintained throughout the proceedings, orally and in writing, that he wished to represent himself. Defendant argues that certain technical errors, specifically a typographical error in the indictment and the prosecutor\u2019s initial misstatement of the maximum sentence at the arraignment, render his conviction invalid. Without a showing of prejudice, these errors do not constitute grounds for reversal. See United States v. Romero, 640 F.2d 1014, 1015 (9th Cir.1981). Defendant has not demonstrated prejudice; the technical errors were promptly corrected. See Garland v. Washington, 232 U.S. 642, 645-46, 34 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed. 772 (1914) (<HOLDING>). AFFIRMED. ** This disposition is not holding that instructional errors that are trial errors are subject to harmless error analysisholding that incorrect charges on substantive elements of a crime constitute reversible errorholding that error in denying such challenge is reversible error without demonstration of prejudiceholding that technical errors in arraignment do not constitute reversible error absent actual prejudice to the defendantholding the denial of a bill of particulars was not reversible error because it failed to cause the defendant any prejudice & \n\ncourt\u2019s denial of a petition for a writ of mandamus filed by a non-attorney representative of a Social Security claimant whose fee agreements had been repeatedly denied. 256 F.3d 1044, 1047 (10th Cir.2001). In that case, we found the petitioner had failed to prove that he had exhausted all other avenues of relief because he had not filed a fee petition pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1725. Id. Although the district court below did not address whether the reasons for the ALJ\u2019s disapproval of the fee agreement were entitled to deference, this does not change Cordoba\u2019s requirement that a representative seeking approval of a fee agreement must exhaust all available administrative remedies \u2014 including a fee petition \u2014 before the writ of mandamus may be granted. See also Power, 292 F.3d at 786 (<HOLDING>). In addition, Baker has not shown that the fee recognizing conflict between filing motion to dismiss and fee application and noting postponement of fee application resulted in no prejudice to any partyholding that where a contract for legal services fails to expressly provide for the amount of the fee a reasonable fee is impliedholding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that petitioner had failed to exhaust alternative remedies for review of his fee agreement because the ssa notified petitioner he could obtain his fee by filing a fee petitionholding that the petitioner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with regard to his claim involving a procedural error correctable by the bia & \n\nDISMISSING FIRST AMENDED PETITION WITHOUT PREJUDICE SAMUEL P. KING, District Judge. I. INTRODUCTION On January 7, 1999, Petitioner Michael Kent Poland (\u201cPetitioner\u201d or \u201cPoland\u201d) filed a First Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, amending a habeas petition filed on- October 20, 1998. Poland seeks, among other things, an evidentiary hearing on a claim that he is currently incompetent to be executed under Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 410, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986) (<HOLDING>). Respondent Terry Stewart, Director of the holding that leaning towards the death penalty is not the same as an automatic vote for the death penaltyholding that the eighth amendment prohibits the state from inflicting the penalty of death upon a prisoner who is insaneholding that the eighth amendment prohibits the punishment of death for a defendant convicting of raping a childholding that the eighth amendment prohibits execution of persons whose mental illness prevents them from comprehending the reasons for the penalty and its implicationsrecognizing that the eighth amendment protects individuals from a lingering death & \n\nJackson. Schreiber argues that Daily\u2019s alleged conflict of interest caused Daily\u2019s (and presumably Neary\u2019s) failure to pursue Jackson\u2019s assertion that she was intimidated. Schreiber also alleges eight other grounds that allegedly show Daily was ineffective. Schreiber did present these other grounds to the court of appeals in a pro se brief, but he was represented by counsel, and the court apparently chose to evaluate only counsel\u2019s arguments. Because Schreiber\u2019s appellate attorney presented only the juror intimidation issue to the court of appeals, and because the court of appeals only addressed that argument in respect to its decision on prejudice, that is the only ground of its decision this Court may review pursuant to \u00a7 2254. See Myartt v. Frank, 395 F.3d 782, 785 (7th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Schreiber does not establish an adverse recognizing that 2254d by its own terms applies only to claims previously adjudicated on the merits in statecourt proceedingsholding that aedpa limits a federal habeas court to the record before the state court where a claim has been adjudicated on the merits by the state courtholding that a claim brought in a pro se brief that the state court did not address was not adjudicated on the merits as required by 2254dholding that aedpa only applies where the state court adjudicated the constitutional issue on the meritsholding that this court will not address the merits of an issue presented for the first time in a reply brief & \n\nclaims are defaulted, but Louisiana prisoners can benefit from the Martinez\/Trevino exception to the procedural-default, rule if they can show that they have a substantial IATC claim and received IAC from state habeas counsel. As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v. Woodard, 9 So.3d 112, 118 (La. 2009) holding court unable to rule on issue when the record fails to include copies of the evidence needed to decide issue on appealholding that an issue not raised on appeal is waivedholding issue not raised in the bankruptcy court was waived on appealholding that if the record discloses evidence needed to decide the issue of iac and that issue was raised by assignment of error on appeal it can be decided on appeal in the interest of judicial economyholding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it & \n\nCURIAM. Petitioner Thomas Alfred Brydon appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition for relief. We affirm. Brydon pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture methamphetamine. At sentencing, the district court applied the career-offender provisions of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 & 4B1.2. The court determined that four prior Iowa convictions for operating a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent and one prior Iowa conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated qualified as predicate crimes of violence. Subsequently, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (<HOLDING>). Later, in United States v. Steward, 598 F.3d holding a felony conviction for driving while intoxicated dwi may be a crime of violenceholding for the purposes of 18 usc 924e that being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a violent felony as defined in 18 usc 924e2bholding that statute prohibiting driving while intoxicated applied to defendant driving on a private parking lotholding that driving while intoxicated is not a violent felony pursuant to 18 usc 924e2bholding that burglary is violent felony & \n\nsucceed, Pearson\u2019s participation must have somehow harmed Iglesias\u2019s defense. Anticipating our conclusion that estoppel requires a showing of prejudice, the Athridges maintain that prejudice should be presumed in this case. This argument stands on firmer ground: An insured may be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, depending on the amount of control the insurer exercised over the defense. See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 384 F.2d 316, 318 (D.C.Cir.1967); Diamond, 476 A.2d at 657-58. Assuming the Athridges were entitled to this presumption, summary judgment was still proper because Aetna rebutted the presumption with uncontroverted evidence that its participation did not harm Iglesias. Cf. Curtis v. Cuff, 537 A.2d 1072, 1075 (D.C.1987) (<HOLDING>). To begin with, Iglesias knew that Aetna would holding that where uncontroverted evidence rebuts a presumption that a defendant consented to the drivers use of his vehicle the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of lawholding that the defendant did not establish good faith as a matter of lawholding that a drivers knowledge that there are concealable weapons in the car available for the drivers use is evidence of possessionholding that even when a defendant moves under rule 50 at the close of plaintiffs evidence and autocentro did not even do that if a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the posttrial stage with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidenceholding that delay caused by or consented to by a defendant is not unreasonable & \n\n106 S.Ct. at 1724 (quoting Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 258, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1096, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). The prosecutor having offered a race-neutral reason for the challenge, the trial court must evaluate the credibility of the parties in order to determine whether the reason articulated by the prosecutor is, indeed, legitimate and non-discriminatory, or if it is, in fact, pretextual. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s observation that the defendant in Batson had made a timely objection to the peremptory challenge, the Fifth Circuit has repeatedly held that in order to preserve the Batson issue for subsequent review, a defendant must make an objection at the l exceptions to the procedural default are not applicable in a Batson claim. Wiley, 969 F.2d at 101 (<HOLDING>). The eases in this line of precedent address holding that the cause and prejudice standard applied to defendants failure to object to his career offender classification at sentencingholding that an assertion of prejudice is not a showing of prejudiceholding that failure to comply with state contemporaneous objection rule bars federal review absent a showing of cause and prejudiceholding that when a district court fails to provide reasons for imposing special conditions and the defendant fails to object we review for plain errorholding that a showing of cause and prejudice fails to overcome a defendants initial failure to object & \n\ncredit against his federal sentence because he would likely have served only half of his 15-month term if it were not for the extradition detainer. We agree with the district court that there was no meaningful evidence to support that argument. For the reasons stated above, the district court\u2019s Order denying Efrosman\u2019s habeas petition is hereby AFFIRMED. 1 . Efrosman\u2019s petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, challenged the propriety of the BOP\u2019s execution of his sentence, not the legality of the district court\u2019s imposition of his sentence. Placing substance over form, see Cook v. New York State Div. of Parole, 321 F.3d 274, 277-78 (2d Cir.2003), the petition is properly construed as brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, see Chambers v. United States, 106 F.3d 472, 474-75 (2d Cir.1997) recognizing our ability to construe a pretrial habeas petition filed under 2254 as being brought under 2241holding that a defendant is not entitled to credit for time served as a condition of probationholding that a 2241 petitioners claim was not cognizable under 2241 and therefore the district court lacked jurisdictionholding that petition relating to calculation of credit for time served during federal detention was properly brought under 2241holding that credit cannot be awarded for time served on community control & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\ndistrict court\u2019s denial of a motion to amend a complaint is abuse of discretion. Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 330, 91 S.Ct. 795, 802, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971); Shipner v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 868 F.2d 401, 407 (11th Cir.1989). After a responsive pleading has been filed, subsequent amendments are permissible only with leave of court, which \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). This liberal policy of allowing amendments under Rule 15(a) \u201ccircumscribes the exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion; thus, unless a substantial reason exists to deny leave to amend, the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.\u201d Shipner, 868 F.2d at 407; see also Moore v. Baker, 989 F.2d 1129, 1131 (11th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added). In this case, the district holding that denial of a postconviction motion without prejudice and with leave to amend is not a final appealable orderholding that denial of leave to amend is error in the absence of justifying reasonsholding that denial of motion for summary judgment is interlocutory even though trial judge had stated that there was no just reason for delay because denial of motion for summary judgment was not a final determination of defendants rights and the appeal did not affect defendants substantial rightsholding that a justifying reason must be apparent for denial of a motion to amendholding that though the court did not expressly state its reason for denying leave to amend it was apparent what delay and prejudice would be caused by plaintiffs motion which sought to add four new individual defendants as well as additional counts under two federal statutes and a statelaw claim & \n\n"}

Generally, the negligent conduct of a physician causes at least some immediate damage to the patient, but the statute of limitations, nonetheless, commences running at termination of the course of treatment, sometime after the initial damage occurs. See Schmit, 183 Minn, at 359, 236 N.W. at 625 (adopting the termination of treatment rule despite the general rule that a statute of limitations action in tort begins to run at the time of the negligent act which coincides with the injury). Zagaros claims the termination of treatment rule is inapplicable in her case because no immediate damage coincided with Erickson\u2019s allegedly negligent misdiagnosis. See Peterson v. St. Cloud Hosp., 460 N.W.2d 635, 639 (Minn.App.1990) (<HOLDING>). She argues she was not injured by any lack of holding that plaintiffs could not sue attorneys for legal malpractice so long as underlying medical malpractice action out of which legal malpractice claim arose was still pending on appealholding that the occurrence of damages determines when a medical malpractice action accruesrecognizing that even when a prisoner files suit under section 1983 alleging medical malpractice against prison medical officials medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisonerholding that absent a contrary mandate from congress the discovery rule determines when a cause of action accrues in a federal question caseholding cause of action accrues when some compensable damage occurs & \n\nargue that their claim for fraud did not accrue until at least September 25, 1992, the date of the consent judgment for civil forfeiture. Plaintiffs filed their complaint in state court on September 23, 1998. Under Michigan law, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff can allege each element of the asserted claim. Moll v. Abbott Labs., 444 Mich. 1, 506 N.W.2d 816, 824 (Mich.1993). Further, Michigan courts apply the discovery rule, whereby a claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, an injury and causal connection between his injury and the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id. (discussing discovery rule in the context of a products liability action); Agristor Fin. Corp. v. Van Sickle, 967 F.2d 233, 236-38 (6th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). In the instant case, the record suggests that recognizing applicability of discovery ruleholding that a discovery exception to a statute of limitation applies only to the discovery of facts not discovery of the lawholding that the time of discovery of fraud is not a proper matter for summary judgmentrecognizing that the heck deferred accrual rule applies to fourteenth amendment equal protection claimsholding that discovery accrual rule applies to causes of action under michigan law for fraud & \n\nfailure to inform the plaintiff of the tumor on February 23, 2002, resulted in any actual injury to the plaintiff before February 24, 2002, the first day of the four-year period in question. Rather, this Court concluded that, although the complained-of negligent act occurred beyond the four-year period of repose in 6-5-482(a), the plaintiff may have been able to prove a set of facts indicating that the actual legal injury occurred within the four-year period of repose. In this case, the trial court explained in its order dismissing Cutler\u2019s medical-malpractice action that the primary difference between Crosslin and the instant case is that Crosslin alleged in his complaint only that his injury occurred at a point after February 24, 2002, and, thus, \u201cCrosslin may [have been] able (<HOLDING>). The key fact in this case is the time at holding that the plaintiffs cause of action accrued on the date of the repealer statute not on the date the wrong occurred despite the federal courts ruling as to the statutes unconstitutionalityholding that the cause of action accrued on the date of saleholding that a plaintiffs 1983 claim accrued on the date of the alleged illegal search and seizureholding that plaintiffs cause of action accrued on the date the ophthalmologist performed the initial surgery and left the gauze at the surgical siteholding that under the rule against splitting a cause of action a new claim for damages is not barred if the underlying cause of action had not accrued at the time of filing the previous lawsuit & \n\nis controlling. 6 As noted above, knowledge of the \"facts\" comprising a cause of action for attorney malpractice is to be distinguished from knowledge that such conduct constitutes malpractice. As noted in Gevaart, the discovery rule does not require that the plaintiff know of the negligent character of the conduct alleged as the cause of his or her injury. See Gevaart, 111 Wn.2d at 502. 7 We note that a limited number of jurisdictions have adopted the position that a judgment of a trial court does not become final and, hence, a party to such action does not incur any injury as a result of negligent representation at such proceeding, until a court of appeals affirms the decision of the trial court and\/or the time to appeal has expired. See Neylan v. Moser, 400 N.W.2d 538 (Iowa 1987) (<HOLDING>). Such an approach may be appropriate where the holding that interest does not begin to accrue until the date of judgment not the date of verdictholding that the date of sale for an installment contract was the date of contract formation not the date of the last payment dueholding that the date of discrimination is the date on which a decision not to hire a plaintiff becomes effectiveholding that the date of injury for purposes of attorney malpractice does not occur until the last possible date when the attorneys negligence becomes irreversibleholding that the date of the federal indictment not the date of the state arrest was the triggering date for the speedytrial act & \n\nprovided, however, that: (t \u215d \u215c \u215d \u201c(2) In respect to those injuries or damages due to acts of medical * * * malpractice which could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence be discoverable at the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action, suit shall be commenced within three (3) years of the time that the act or acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.\u201d (Emphases added.) Under the plain language of \u00a7 9-1-14.1, in order to toll the malpractice statute of limitations, there must be a finding that the plaintiff exercised reasonable diligence at the time the injury occurred, yet failed to discover a wrongful act on the part of the defendant. See Grossi v. Miriam Hospital, 689 A.2d 403, 404 (R.I.1997) (<HOLDING>). In contrast, the tolling provision contained holding prescription defense available to wife who asserted that she was holding her husbands pills on his behalfholding erisa did not apply when doctor was not employee of the medical association of the state of alabamaholding that a wifes minimal involvement in her husbands business coupled with the lack of evidence that she knew of or intended to further her husbands fraudulent schemes was insufficient evidence of conspiracyholding that the tolling provision of 91141 did not apply when the plaintiff knew that medical negligence may have contributed to her husbands death but asserted that she did not know the identity of the doctor who treated himholding that where petitioner testified she did not know who fired shots at her ear or why the evidence did not compel the conclusion that the shooting was based on her political opinion & \n\ndistributed. Inasmuch as the Ohio Legislature has not expressly adopted a discovery rule in libel and\/or invasion of privacy cases and because of the single publication rule, the cause of action as to the plaintiff in her libel and invasion-of-privacy claims accrued in December 1975. Therefore, this Court concludes the present case is not timely filed. PLAINTIFF\u2019S CLAIM FOR INTENTIONAL INFLICTION OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS The plaintiff Donda R. Morgan also contends that she has brought an independent action for intentional infliction of emotional distress, and that this cause of action did not accrue until the first time she was aware of the picture. The tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress is a new and recognized theory of a tort action. See Yeager v. Local Union 20, supra (<HOLDING>). In the present case, the plaintiff has only holding that act did not bar intentional infliction of emotional distress claimrecognizing validity of cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distressrecognizing torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distressholding that intentional infliction of emotional distress is a personal injury tortholding that a tort claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is distinct from a claim for emotional distress damages under the employment discrimination statute & \n\nSignal Corp., 68 F.3d 1488, 1492 (2d Cir.1995) (same); Flanigan v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, Chauffers, Warehousemen & Helpers of America, 942 F.2d 824, 827 (2d Cir.1991) (same); Ghartey v. St. John\u2019s Queens Hosp., 869 F.2d 160, 165 (2d Cir.1989) (same). Applying this standard to this case, we conelud\u00e9 that the cause of action did not accrue prior to January 28, 1999, and therefore this action was timely filed. IAM initially suggests that the cause of action accrued in 1993 when it announced its position that plaintiffs would not be credited with their Eastern seniority. This argument borders on the absurd because, although we have held that the harm that results from the union\u2019s breach need not be beyond all doubt for a cause of action to accrue, see, e.g., Buttry, 68 F.3d at 1492-93 (<HOLDING>), we cannot accept IAM\u2019s contention that the recognizing that union members interests are adequately represented by the unionholding that the breach occurs when the union acts against the interest of its membersholding that cause of action accrued when union manifestly abandoned the interests of its membersrecognizing union members vital concern in preserving jobs for union membersholding that the cause of action accrued on the date of sale & \n\n2d 353, 361 (1995). The term \u201cwrongfully caused\u201d refers to the point in time in which \u201cthe injured person becomes possessed of sufficient information concerning his injury and its cause to put a reasonable person on inquiry to determine whether actionable conduct is involved.\u201d Knox College v. Celotex Corp., 88 Ill. 2d 407, 416 (1981). Historically, the limitations period for bringing a wrongful death action has been regarded as a condition precedent, not modified or affected by the general statute of limitations. Fure v. Sherman Hospital, 64 Ill. App. 3d 259, 264 (1978). However, as plaintiff correctly notes, the discovery rule has been applied to wrongful death actions under certain circumstances. See, e.g., Coleman v. Hinsdale Emergency Medical Corp., 108 Ill. App. 3d 525, 529 (1982) (<HOLDING>); Fure, 64 Ill. App. 3d 259 (same). holding that a failure to include a beneficiary in a wrongful death action is a defect because the wrongful death act restricts plaintiffs to a single actionholding that a surviving spouse can bring a wrongful death action based on medical malpracticerecognizing cause of action for wrongful deathholding that plaintiffs failure to prove decedents death was caused by the wrongful acts of the defendant precludes any recovery of wrongful death damages under mississippis wrongful death statuteholding that discovery rule applied to wrongful death action predicated on medical malpractice & \n\nconduct proximately caused his injuries. Mellen v. Lane, 377 S.C. 261, 280, 659 S.E.2d 236, 246 (Ct.App.2008). \u201cFor an intervening act to break the causal link and insulate the tortfeasor from further liability, the intervening act must be unforeseeable.\u201d Dixon v. Besco Eng\u2019g, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 180, 463 S.E.2d 636, 640 (Ct.App. 1995). Ordinarily, proximate cause is a question for the jury, but when the evidence is susceptible to only one inference, it becomes a matter of law for the court. Platt, 379 S.C. at 266, 665 S.E.2d at 640. Although we did not find and the parties did not provide any South Carolina cases directly on point, other jurisdictions have contemplated situations similar to the one at hand. See, e.g., Tolton v. Am. Biodyne, Inc., 48 F.3d 937, 944 (6th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); Darren v. Safier, 207 A.D.2d 473, 615 holding that a tortfeasor is required to pay the expenses of over treatment or unnecessary medical treatment unless such treatment was incurred by the victim in bad faith holding that conduct by the plaintiff contributing to his illness or medical condition and furnishing the occasion for medical treatment is not a defense to medical malpractice where a doctor negligently treated a man who had attempted to commit suicideholding when the decedent committed suicide more than one month after his last visit to the hospital and received treatment from two other hospitals during that onemonth period the plaintiffs could not prove damages because of the time lapse and intervening medical treatmentholding that under title vii the ultimate issue is the reason for the individual plaintiffs treatment not the relative treatment of different groups within the workplaceholding that a two month period might be enough to prove the causation prong & \n\nconcealment rule states that when facts essential to the cause of action are fraudulently concealed, the statute of limitations is tolled until the plaintiff has discovered such facts or could have done so in the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Bricker v. Putnam, 128 N.H. 162, 165 (1986). Here, the rule is inapplicable because, as the trial court found, the plaintiff knew, or \u201cin the exercise of reasonable diligence should have discovered the causal r 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (NewYork courts \u201cdo not generally regard the accountant-client relationship as a fiduciary one\u201d (quotation omitted)), there is no support in our case law for the proposition that a limitations period is tolled in fiduciary cases until the fiduciary discloses his or her misconduct. See Furbush, 149 N.H. at 430-31 (<HOLDING>). Moreover, despite the defendants\u2019 failure to holding that although the defendantattorney did not disclose to the plaintiff his failure to file a claim in a timely manner the limitations period on the legal malpractice claim began to run when the plaintiff could reasonably discern that he suffered some harm caused by the defendants conductholding that the date on which the plaintiff learned of the defendants denial of tenure not the date on which the plaintiff became unemployed was when the statute of limitations began to runholding that the statute of limitations for an attorney malpractice suit did not begin to run until the client had suffered some actual damageholding that the statute of limitations for a miscalculation of benefits claim began to run at the time at which some event other than a denial of a claim should have alerted the claimant to his entitlement to the benefits he did not receiveholding that statute of limitations for malpractice begins to run when plaintiff knows or has reason to know of the alleged malpractice & \n\nthe Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution. However, if Johnson\u2019s claim rests upon the ineffectiveness of his attorney on appeal, then his cause of action could not have accrued prior to the disposition of his appeal. For these reasons, we find that Johnson\u2019s cause of action for habeas corpus did not accrue until his direct appeal was decided by this court on May 19, 1989. See Johnson, 774 P.2d 1141. Because this decision occurred after the legislature\u2019s deletion of imprisonment as a disability that tolls the statute of limitations under section 78-12-36, the trial court correctly held that Johnson\u2019s claim was time-barred. We recognize that the ninety-day statute of limitations applicable to habeas corpus actions has been declared unconstitutional. See Currier, 862 P.2d 1357 (<HOLDING>); see also Renn v. Utah State Bd. of Pardons, recognizing that rights under article i section 11 are subject to reasonable limitationsholding that executive branch prosecution of disciplinary charges against a judge violated the separation of powers provision in the nevada constitution a provision identical to article v section 1 of the utah constitutionholding that refusal to proceed to trial by arbitrarily abating case violates article i section 13 of the texas constitutionholding that the contracts clause article i section 10 clause 1 to the united states constitution does not apply to the actions of the federal governmentholding that ninetyday statute of limitations on habeas actions is unreasonable limitation that violates article i section 11 of utah constitution & \n\nshield to justice.\u201d We find no authority on which to do so and Plaintiff provides us with none. {33} This Court previously indicated, although not specifically addressing an argument concerning conflicting public policies created by the Legislature, that negligence arising out of the violation of a statutory duty does not change the immunity granted under the Tort Claims Act. See Rubio v. Carlsbad Mun. Sch. Dist., 106 N.M. 446, 449, 744 P.2d 919, 922 (Ct.App.1987) (denying education malpractice claim based on duties under the Certified School Personnel Act, stating the claim was \u201ca form of negligence and the courts of this state would have no jurisdiction over the claim unless there was a waiver of immunity\u201d); Begay v. State, 104 N.M. 483, 487-88, 723 P.2d 252, 256-57 (Ct.App.1985) (<HOLDING>), rev\u2019d on other grounds by Smialek v. Begay, holding that plaintiffs claim that medical providers did not comply with baker act was not subject to medical malpractice statutes ajlthough a medical diagnosis is necessary in order to involuntarily commit a patient the process of complying with the statute does not require medical skill or judgmentholding that general statement of intent does not override plain language of statuteholding state medical examiner immune from alleged violation of autopsy statute stating even if the statute does create a private cause of action it does not override the medical investigators grant of immunity under the tort claims actholding that the ada does not create a remedy for medical malpracticeholding at least under the facts of the case that the statute of limitations in a medical malpractice action did not begin to run until the plaintiff secured a specific medical diagnosis & \n\n985 (3d Cir. 1988). In this case, it is evident that Prive\u2019s injury occurred in the context of Dr. Fabian\u2019s business activities. Clearly if Prive had tripped while in Dr. Fabian\u2019s office, see also Harad, supra at 985, had been exposed to disease because Dr. Fabian had improperly labeled laboratory samples, see Doe v. Doctors Bryan, Hatcher, Vick and Gastings, 623 So.2d 722 (Ct.App.La. 1993), or had injured herself moving a patient, see Duprey v. Shane, 249 P.2d 8, 13 (Ca. 1952), a medical malpractice action would not be warranted. As these cases recognize, the proper recourse for a physician\u2019s negligence toward nonpatients is a common law claim for negligence rather than a claim for medical malpractice. See Doe, supra at 723; see also Roe v. Federal Ins. Co., 412 Mass. 43, 49-50 (1992) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the exclusion clause in the holding that a patients settlement of a prior action brought against him by doctors for payment of a bill did not bar medical malpractice action against doctorsholding that doctors conduct toward patient that does not come within penumbra of doctorpatient relationship cannot form basis for malpractice actionholding that doctors may limit the extent of their responsibility to patients by narrowing the scope of the doctorpatient relationshipholding that provision would not be enforced due to that fact that the doctorpatient relationship is special and entitled to unique protectionholding that an obligation imposed by statute cannot form the basis for a statutory employer relationship & \n\na claim for relief and that no exceptions to this obligation would seemingly be authorized. In Borger v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, the Nevada Supreme Court, albeit in dicta, concluded \u201cNRS 41A.071 clearly mandates dismissal, without leave to amend, for complete failure to attach an affidavit to the complaint. This interpretation is consistent with the underlying purpose of the measure, which is to ensure that such actions be brought in good faith based upon competent expert opinion.\u201d 120 Nev. 1021, 1029, 102 P.3d 600, 606 (2004) (emphasis added); accord Collins v.

Perez, 125 Nev. 728, 219 P.3d 906, recognizing that even when a prisoner files suit under section 1983 alleging medical malpractice against prison medical officials medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisonerholding a medical malpractice complaint filed without a supporting medical expert affidavit is void ab initio and as a consequence it does not legally exist and thus it cannot be amended under rule 15a of the nevada rules of civil procedureholding that a north carolina rule requiring an expert certification in a medical malpractice case applied in a federal tort claims act case sounding in medical malpractice brought in federal courtrecognizing that a plaintiff must produce a medical expert to testify as to causation in all but the most selfevident medical malpractice actionsholding that the ada does not create a remedy for medical malpractice & \n\nfinancial interest in AeroMed. First, the order does not in any form prohibit the offering of evidence; it prohibits certain claims. Second, the language clearly permits claims of medical malpractice and lack of informed consent, which are the issues in the instant case. Next, the order only prohibits the assertion of claims that have as an essential element a financial relationship between the physician and AeroMed. However, this case is a medical malpractice and lack of informed consent action that does not require proof of a financial interest as an essential element. See Rauch v. Mike-Mayer, 783 A.2d 815, 824 (Pa.Super.2001) (stating the essential elements required to prove medical malpractice); and see Bey v. Sacks, 789 A.2d 232, 2001 WL 1602971 (Pa.Super. December 14, 2001) (<HOLDING>). \u00b6 23 As stated above, questions referring to holding that a patient who endures an operation without his consent may base his action on a tortious batteryholding that battery is an inherently included offense of aggravated batteryholding that an operation without the patients consent sounds in batteryholding that battery is clearly a factual determination readily resolved by the application of a legal standard defining battery to the facts in questionholding that in pennsylvania lack of informed consent claims utilize a battery standard that is a physician commits battery where the patient does not consent to the procedure on his person thus constituting a harmful or offensive contact & \n\n227, 231-32 (S.D.N.Y.2001). However, the prospective class members were not denied benefits; they received benefits that they later discovered were miscalculated with resulting underpayment. The relevant date for fixing the accrual of such a claim is when a plaintiff was put on notice that the defendants believed the method used to calculate his disability pension was correct. Thus, the claim does not begin to run until a prospective class member inquires about the calculation of his benefits and the Plan rejects his claim that the benefits were miscalculated. See e.g., Davis v. NMU Pension & Welfare Plan, 810 F.Supp. 532, 536 (S.D.N.Y.1992); Kiefer v. Ceridian Corp., 976 F.Supp. 829, 842-43 (D.Minn. 1997); Cotter v. E. Conf. of Teamsters Ret. Plan, 898 F.2d 424, 429 (4th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to plaintiffs argument, it is holding that where oral loan was silent as to the time of repayment the statute of limitations began to run at the time the contract was madeholding that the statute of limitations for a miscalculation of benefits claim began to run at the time at which some event other than a denial of a claim should have alerted the claimant to his entitlement to the benefits he did not receiveholding that a plaintiff in an erisa denial of benefits case bears the burden of proving her entitlement to contractual benefitsholding that although the defendantattorney did not disclose to the plaintiff his failure to file a claim in a timely manner the limitations period on the legal malpractice claim began to run when the plaintiff could reasonably discern that he suffered some harm caused by the defendants conductholding that the consideration of the fact that claimant collected unemployment benefits while he was allegedly disabled was not a ground for reversal where there was other medical and vocational evidence supporting denial of benefits and claimants receipt of unemployment benefits was not decisive factor in denial of benefits & \n\ntort,\" and their \"accrual dates are linked to the accrual date[s] of the underlying tort[s].\" Prince George's County v.

The trial court entered a final judgment against the Hospital and in favor of Ms. Liles for $500,000 in compensatory damages and for $1,000,000 in punitive damages. The Hospital now appeals. II. Analysis A. Medical malpractice The Hospital first argues that the trial court erred in failing to treat this case as a medical malpractice case subject to the provisions of chapter 766. We disagree. Section 766.106(l)(a), Florida Statutes (2004), defines a \u201c[cjlaim for medical negligence\u201d or \u201cclaim for medical malpractice\u201d as \u201ca claim, arising out of 712 (Fla. 2d DCA 1995) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, Ms. Liles, who was not a holding at least under the facts of the case that the statute of limitations in a medical malpractice action did not begin to run until the plaintiff secured a specific medical diagnosisholding that parents claims of outrage and negligent handling of a body were not subject to the medical malpractice statutes because hospital personnel did not engage in any medical skill or judgment in the disposition of the childs remainsholding that plaintiffs claim that medical providers did not comply with baker act was not subject to medical malpractice statutes ajlthough a medical diagnosis is necessary in order to involuntarily commit a patient the process of complying with the statute does not require medical skill or judgmentholding that there was insufficient evidence that alleged victim made statements to forensic nurseexaminer for purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment in part because there was no evidence regarding alleged victims past experience with medical facilities or medical providersrecognizing that even when a prisoner files suit under section 1983 alleging medical malpractice against prison medical officials medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner & \n\non appeal, therefore, turns on the legal question of the burden of proof. We review questions of law de novo. See Housing Fin. & Dev. Corp. v. Fe cts Liability \u00a7 8.04[7][b], at 8-228-27 (rev. ed.1999): As a practical matter, ... in most strict liability lawsuits, in most jurisdictions, whether or not there was a substantial change in the condition in the product is a non-issue.

As well, we agree with Haygood that the circuit court erred in distinguishing this case from Crawford on the bases that the statement in Crawford (1) was taken in a custodial interrogation and (2) was not an excited utterance. First, the fact that the statements here were not taken at a police station during custodial interrogation, although a proper factor to consider, is not dispositive. See Davis, 547 U.S. at 827, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (considering the difference in the level of formality between the interview in the station house in Crawford and the frantic 911 call in Davis as one of the factors in determining whether the statements from the 911 call were testimonial); Hammon, 547 U.S. at 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266 (<HOLDING>); Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1166-67 (considering the recognizing the crawford interrogation was more formal but determining the interrogation of hammons wife was formal enough in considering that factor and determining the wifes statements were testimonialrecognizing that there are no formal procedures for determining the validity of rs 2477 claimsholding that edwards protection only extends to interrogation and that denial of counsel is only one factor to be considered in determining whether consent was voluntarily given but it is not a decisive factholding that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of an allegedly coerced interrogation where the taped interrogation was played for jurors and the defendant crossexamined the witness at length about the interrogationholding that the sixth amendment generally permits interrogation of a represented person only 1 if it was the defendant and not the government who initiated the interrogation and 2 if the defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel & \n\nreport constitutes an admission of a party-opponent, which is an exception to the hearsay rule. Snizaski counters that she offered the police accident report solely to establish the approximate time of the accident and, therefore, was not an admission of the truth of the substantive statements contained in the report. Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 802 provides that hearsay is not admissible unless some exception applies. \u201cA police report prepared by an officer who is not a witness to the accident is inadmissible hearsay evidence and should not be admitted into evidence. Nor should a party be able to get such a report into evidence in an indirect manner.\u201d Holland v. Zelnick, 329 Pa.Super. 469, 478 A.2d 885, 888 (1984); See Johnson v. Peoples Cab Company, 386 Pa. 513, 126 A.2d 720 (1956) (<HOLDING>); accord Harvey v. Doliner, 399 Pa. 356, 160 holding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding that a report of a police officer who arrived at an accident scene minutes after a collision which contained a statement that one of the vehicles traveled through a stop sign was inadmissible hearsay evidenceholding that witness statements in police report inadmissibleholding that the defendant was guilty of leaving the scene because the injured party and a police officer were present at the scene within a reasonable time after the accidentholding that hearsay within a police report was inadmissible & \n\nthat he told the same story before the motive or influence came into existence or before the time of the alleged recent fabrication. [In those circumstances], the prior consistent statement is defined as not hearsay . . . and thus is admitted into evidence. Unless a witness\u2019s veracity has affirmatively been placed in issue, the witness\u2019s prior consistent statement is pure hearsay evidence, which cannot be admitted merely to corroborate the witness, or to bolster the witness\u2019s credibility in the eyes of the jury.

Rule 803(24) is identical to Rule 804(b)(5), which is the corresponding \u201ccatchall exception\u201d to be used when the declarant is unavailable. See State v. Posten, 302 N.W.2d 638, 641 (Minn.1981). We have considered either Rule 803(24) or 804(b)(5) in a number of cases, including: State v. Langley, 354 N.W.2d 389 (Minn.1984) (admission of hearsay accounts of prior assaults upon homicide victim by defendant under Rule 804(b)(5)); State v. Hansen, 312 N.W.2d 96 (Minn.1981) (<HOLDING>); State v.

Admission of Evidence Regarding Victim\u2019s Identification of Polite from a Photo Line-Up Polite next contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of Ms. Levine\u2019s out-of-court identification of him from a photo line-up on grounds that the State failed to inquire into this issue during its direct examination of Ms. Levine.

Though DeToto\u2019s affidavit does not explicitly state that Roberts refused to provide an affidavit, we believe the affidavit implicitly makes this contention through DeToto\u2019s statement that he had spoken with Roberts and that Roberts had denied making the statements. 36 . Because we have found, based on the reasoning already discussed in this section, that appellant\u2019s affidavits are not deficient, we need not address whether appellant\u2019s affidavits are sufficient on some other basis. More specifically, we need not consider whether Roberts\u2019 alleged statements to Clinton are admissible through Clinton because they constitute an admission by party-opponent. See Tex.R.

Thus, the responses to the questionnaires must themselves fall within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rale. Cf. In re G.Y., 962 P.2d 78, 85 (Utah Ct. App. 1998) (<HOLDING>). Because the Spa does not contend that the holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were madeholding that exclusion of hearsay statements violated due process even though statements were not admissible under mississippi law which did not recognize declarations against penal interest as a exception to the rule against hearsayholding that factors used in determining whether hearsay statements are sufficiently reliable to satisfy hearsay exceptions also apply to whether statements have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness under confrontation clauseholding that thirdparty statements contained in dcfs caseworker reports constituted hearsayrecognizing that the united states constitution may require courts to admit exculpatory hearsay statements that do not fall within any recognized hearsay exception & \n\nand to have that determination declared presumptive evidence of disability and inability to work, subject only to rebuttal by the defense.

That being said, I would caution that the fact that witness Berry saw defendant in the area may have been relevant evidence. However, I address only the propriety of the admission into evidence of witness Berry\u2019s reiteration of the woman\u2019s statements, as opposed to witness Berry\u2019s testimony that she saw defendant in the area. While defendant\u2019s presence may have been relevant, the statements of Ms. Love, who did not testify at trial and who made no comment incriminating defendant with respect to the charged crimes was not relevant evidence. 2 While no Michigan case has addressed this issue, I note the following federal cases in support of my position: Krulewitch v United States, 336 US 440; 69 S Ct 716; 93 L Ed 790 (1949) (<HOLDING>); United States v Reynolds, 715 F2d 99, 103 (CA holding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding that when defendant was guilty of burglary but the only evidence that he was armed was from his own statement existence of the firearm went only to the degree of the offense and was not as an element of proofholding where neither defense counsel nor the trial court explained to the defendant that intent to cause death was an element of seconddegree murder and there was no factual statement or admission implying intent the plea was involuntaryholding that the outofcourt statement by the victims mother which was admitted when the mother refused to testify at trial was inadmissible under residual hearsay exception in mil revid 804b5 because a much of her statement was double or triple hearsay that was most unreliable and b the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement were not supported by any particularized guarantees of trustworthinessholding that hearsay within a police report was inadmissible & \n\nthe only major issue was the identity of the robbers.\u201d Id. 21 .Similarly, if the defense indicates that it will present evidence during its case to impeach the testimony of a State witness (as in Milligan and Cobh), there is no concern that the State will not have the \"predicate issue\u201d to justify offering further evidence to refute the defense evidence during the State\u2019s rebuttal case. 22 . The legislature has established entrapment as an affirmative defense with the concomitant burden of proof on the defendant rather than as an element of an offense to be negated in the State\u2019s prima facie case. See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 432(a). 23 . Arguments by counsel during opening statements and summation are not evidence and thus cannot be said to raise an affirmative defense. Cf. Milligan 761 A.2d at 8 (<HOLDING>). 24 . Cf. United States v. Bailey, D.C.Cir., holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence where the evidence would serve only to impeach testimonyholding that evidence of a later sexual encounter that triggered the delayed report was admissible only after milligan had in fact introduced evidence of late reporting to impeach the victims testimonyholding that remedial measures evidence was not admissible to impeach testimony that at the time of the event the measure was not believed to be as practical as the one employedrecognizing that if the government introduced evidence tending to show that the victims did not expect to engage in prostitution it will have put those victims sexual histories at issue and under those circumstances it is possible that evidence rebutting the governments allegations might be admissible under the constitutional exceptionholding that evidence of prior uncharged sexual conduct with the victim is admissible to corroborate the victims testimony & \n\nhave merit. Carnahan\u2019s statement to Det. Tecklen-burg was an out-of-court statement \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d i.e. that David was involved in the conspiracy and served in the role of money collector or \u201cmuscle\u201d for Martin. Fed. R Evid. 801(c). David made a timely objection to the admission of this aspect of Det. Tecklenburg\u2019s testimony, and we find no applicable exclusion to the hearsay definition nor exception to the general rule of inadmissibility that would permit Det. Tecklenburg\u2019s testimony. Carnahan was a cooperating informant and his statement to Det. Tecklenburg was made in that capacity, not in the capacity of co-conspirator and not in furtherance of the conspiracy. See United States v. Alonzo, 991 F.2d 1422, 1425-26 (8th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). Also, it is not clear that Pieters\u2019s holding that statements by a cooperating coconspirator to known authorities made after the commencement of cooperation are not admissible under rule 801d2e because such statements are not made in furtherance of the conspiracyholding that statements made to keep a coconspirator informed as to the groups drug supply were made in furtherance of the conspiracyholding that post arrest statements made by coconspirator to law enforcement officer were not admissible under rule 801d2e but admission of testimony was harmless because officers testimony was cumulativeholding a trial court should not allow a jury to hear outofcourt coconspirator declarations before holding a hearing outside the jurys presence to determine whether such statements are admissible under federal rule of evidence 801d2eholding that statements aimed at preventing detection and punishment were not admissible under the coconspirator exception because admission of such statements would expand exception to hearsay rule to include declarations made not in furtherance of conspiracy charged but made in furtherance of an alleged implied but uncharged conspiracy aimed at preventing detection and punishment & \n\nsimply did not bar the use of the residual exception. We note that Judge Wiss dissented from the Court\u2019s decision on this issue and complained \u201cthat the majority has erred by shuffling past one of the three absolute prerequisites for admission of hearsay under\u201d the residual exception by passing over the fact that the child\/vietim in Morgan was available and did testify, albeit in a somewhat limited manner. 40 M.J. at 413 (Wiss, J., dissenting). (2). As to the second part of the appellant\u2019s argument, that AK\u2019s testimony should not have been admitted because better evidence (i.e., Mr. Mills\u2019 tes ority for his contention except to quote our opinion in Martindale out of context. Martindale did not involve the exclusion or possible exclusion of other evidence because, as we pointed out 88) (<HOLDING>). We conclude that this aspect of Mil.R.Evid. holding also that only a childs first statement made is admissible under the exceptionholding childvictims statement to babysitter admissible un der residual exception in addition to statement to physician under medical treatment exceptionholding multiple statements by childvictim and childs mother admissible under residual exceptionholding statement by childvictim to teachers aide admissible under residual exception in addition to statements to school nurse and pediatrician under medical treatment exceptionholding ehildvictims testimony at pretrial investigation admissible under residual exception in addition to doctors testimony under medical treatment exception & \n\n\u201cstrategic\u201d decision entitled to deference is a \u201cconscious, reasonably informed decision made by an attorney with an eye to benefitting his client\u201d). In contrast, there is no allegation in this case that defense counsel failed to investigate the relevant alibi witnesses, or failed to file the required notice of alibi. The fact that defense counsel conducted a mock trial demonstrates that their decision not to call such witnesses was a quintessential strategic decision entitled to the highest level of deference under Strickland. While defense counsel promised alibi evidence during his opening statement, his failure to introduce the wives\u2019 testimony does not, in and of itself, constitute constitutionally deficient performance. See Harrison v. Motley, 478 F.3d 750, 758-59 (6th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>); see also Williams v. Bowersox, 340 F.3d 667, holding that failure to object to admissible evidence was not ineffective assistance of counselholding that trial counsels failure to call defendants family members as witnesses during penalty phase was reasonable trial strategy and not ineffective assistance of counselholding that the ineffective assistance of counsel claim for counsels failure to present the preindictment delay issue was without merit because there was no actual prejudice to the supposed alibi defense as the now unavailable witnesses would not have provided the defendant with an alibi for the time when the murder could have occurredholding the failure to call alibi witnesses promised during opening statement was not ineffective assistance of counselholding that the failure to call certain witnesses was not ineffective assistance because witnesses already presented similar evidence and counsel is not required to present cumulative evidence & \n\nnot dealing with what the law calls sexual penetration.

The complaints of irrelevance and prejudice are waived because they were not raised at trial. See Tex.R.App. P. 33.1(a). Regarding the Town\u2019s hearsay complaint, Chief Brungardt was the Town\u2019s agent or employee, and his authorization of Teague\u2019s investigation into the Wess Jones incident was in the course and scope of his employment as chief of police. Accordingly, Teague\u2019s testimony that Chief Brungardt did not object to Teague\u2019s investigation of Wess, but actually authorized it, was an admission by a party-opponent and was not hearsay. See Tex.R. Evid. 801(e)(2)(D); see also Excel Corp. v. Porras, 14 S.W.3d 307, 314 n. 1 (Tex.App.Corpus Christi 1999, pet. denied) (<HOLDING>); McEwen v.

Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\nno matter how quickly and ably given, could salvage a fair trial for the defendant.\u201d). Moreover, apparently the only reason the State sought to introduce the prior inconsistent statement was its belief that the jury would be swayed by the statement when determining guilt, or innocence. See United States v. Webster, 734 F.2d 1191, 1192 (7th Cir.1984) (\u201c[I]t would be an abuse of the [impeachment] rule, in a criminal case, for the prosecution to call a witness that it knew would not give it useful evidence, just\u201d so it could introduce hearsay evidence against the defendant in the hope that the jury would miss the subtle distinction between impeachment and substantive evidence \u2014 or, if it didn\u2019t miss it, would ignore it.\u201d (emphasis added)). See also Nance, 331 Md. at 566, 629 A.2d at 642 (<HOLDING>); State v.

United States v. Young Bros., Inc., 728 F.2d 682, 693 (5th Cir.1984). Thus, the issue is whether the amendment to the serial number constituted a change in form akin to correcting a typographical error or a change in substance that impermissibly altered the indictment. Although we have never addressed this question directly, precedent from this circuit and others suggests that the particular attributes of a firearm are not actual elements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v.

In any event, this amendment was also permissible..

Thus, the rule contains no authority to amend the charging document in a delinquency case after commencement of the adjudicatory hearing. {8} The State, however, attempts to rely on the provision in Rule 10-103(F) that permits amendments in order to correct mistakes in the pleadings. This ment. Roman, 1998-NMCA-132, \u00b6 12, 125 N.M. 688, 964 P.2d 852. Only amendments that are made to conform to the evidence in support of the charge on which defendant was tried are permissible.

First, the \u201cattempt\u201d language appears after \u201cknowingly\u201d and before the other elements of the crime. \u201cAttempt\u201d can fairly be read to modify all of the elements that follow the word, not just the \u201cmeans or facility of interstate commerce\u201d element. Second, even if the \u201cattempt\u201d language in the superseding indictment is somewhat imprecise, this does not render the superseding indictment insufficient. \u201c[D]ue process does not require a recitation of the statute; it requires only that the [indictment] as a whole set forth the critical details of the offense charged.\u201d United States v. Lentsch, 369 F.3d 948, 953 (6th Cir.2004); see also United States v. Martinez, 981 F.2d 867, 872 (6th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Third, given the circumstances in which this holding that the government need not prove that the defendant actually knew the exact nature of the substance to establish mens rea knowledge of drugs illegality is sufficientholding that a mens rea of unlawfully in the indictment was sufficient because the indictment referenced the applicable statute which required a reckless mens reaholding convictions under fla stat 893131 qualify as serious drug offenses pursuant to the acca despite the florida statutes lack of a mens rea elementholding that an indictment gave sufficient notice when the indictment charged the elements of the offenseholding that an indictment that omitted the mens rea element was sufficient because it cited the applicable statutes which informed the defendant of the elements of the charged offenses & \n\nof self-defense, and a person is just as capable of defending himself with a marked firearm as with an unmarked firearm. With or without a serial number, a pistol is still a pistol. Furthermore, it cannot be the case that possession of a firearm in the home for self-defense is a protected form of possession under all circumstances. By this rationale, any type of firearm possessed in the home would be protected merely because it could be used for self-defense. Possession of machine guns or short-barreled shotguns \u2014 or any other dangerous and unusual weapon' \u2014 so long as they were kept in the home, would then fall within the Second Amendment. But the Supreme Court has made clear the Second Amendment does not protect those types of weapons. See Miller, 307 U.S. at 178, 59 S.Ct. 816 (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Fincher, 538 F.3d holding that when regulations are intended to have different purposes and are not dependent on each other they are not intertwinedholding that shortbarreled shotguns are unprotectedholding that arguments which are not sufficiently developed are waivedholding that arguments that are not raised or that are not accompanied by factual and legal support are deemed waivedholding that possession of a shortbarreled shotgun is a violent felony under the accas residual clause because sawedoff shotguns are inherently dangerous and lack usefulness except for violent and criminal purposes internal quotation marks omitted & \n\nRule 29(c)). 9 . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) states, in relevant part; It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 10 .It is not clear whether the government attempted to demonstrate that the pistol and rifle were acquired separately and at different times or places. If they did not make such a showing, the indictment under which Alanis was charged would be duplicitous under our recent holding in United States v. Buchmeier, 255 F.3d 415, 422 (7th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The defense did not challenge the indictment holding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involvedholding that when the indictment charges that a certain minimum quantity of drugs is involved in the offense proof of that quantity is a fourth element of the offenseholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that the quantity of drugs involved in an offense does not support a downward departure because the legislature intended the quantity of drugs to be a determining factor in varying penaltiesholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that count & \n\n1223, 1228 (7th Cir.1994) (same); United States v. Badalamenti, No. S.S. 84 Cr. 236CPNL), 1985 WL 2572, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 19, 1985) (referring to a second indictment that would be returned after dismissal of a first indictment because of section 2517(5) violations, the same situation as in this case, as a \u201csuperseding\u201d indictment). Therefore, the court holds that the second indictment in this case can properly be referred to as a \u201csuperseding\u201d indictment. The superseding-versus-new-indictment issue might have been an interesting and relevant debate if the Speedy Trial Act or the statute of limitations were the focus of defendants\u2019 appeals from the Detention Order, because those are the only situations in which it matters whether an indictment is a superseding indictme (D.C.1979) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Thoresen, 428 F.2d 654, holding that application of the doctrine of law of the case is discretionary and that a district court abuses its discretion in applying the law of the case doctrine only if 1 the first decision was clearly erroneous 2 an intervening change in the law occurred 3 the evidence on remand was substantially different 4 other changed circumstances exist or 5 a manifest injustice would otherwise resultholding that the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same caseholding that the application of the fair use doctrine at the pleading stage is appropriateholding that for all intents and purposes the instant case is the same action that was brought previously we therefore find the application of the doctrine of the law of the case to be appropriateholding that the degree of the loss of use of a body part is a question of fact whether the loss is for all practical intents and purposes is a question of law & \n\nincludes \u201cseveral transactions or occur rences, any of which could constitute one of the acts proscribed by the charged statutes.\u201d United States v. Beros, 883 F.2d 455, 460-61 (3d Cir.1987). The Beros court noted that \u201cjust as the sixth amendment requires jury unanimity in federal criminal cases on each delineated offense that it finds a defendant culpable ... it must also require unanimity regarding the specific act or acts which constitutes that offense. Absent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too little protection in too many instances.\u201d Id. at 461. The Seventh Circuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to Holley. See United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 471 (7th Cir.1998). But see United States v. Margiotta, 646 F.2d 729, 733 (2d Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>). The risks of serious unfairness presented by holding that when two underlying offenses are charged in an indictment for capital murder the state need only prove one of the two offenses to support the convictionholding that only one offense should have been charged when four separate packages of the same drug were foundrecognizing that delay in indictment may sometimes be a basis for a sentencing departure but holding that district court erred when it decreased sentence based on a delay in an indictment where the offenses were separate crimes distinct in time place and victimsholding that the policy considerations behind the unanimity requirement suggest that a single count of an indictment should not be found impermissibly duplicitous whenever it contains several allegations that could have been stated as separate offenses but only when the failure to do so risks unfairness to the defendantholding unanimity requirement not violated when charge stated two separate counts with two separate and distinct offenses in each case & \n\nBlankenship admits that these prior convictions fall within the class of felonies to which the statute refers, but he contends that they were too remote in time to serve as a proper predicate for enhancement of the sentence. If a statute that imposes a criminal penalty is ambiguous, it must be construed in favor of the defendant. See Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980). However, in this case, section 924(e)(1) is not ambiguous. There is no indication, either in the statute or in the legislative history, that Congress intended to include a temporal restriction in that statute. See United States v. Green, 904 F.2d 654, 655-56 (11th Cir.1990); see also Young v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 690 F.Supp. 990, 995 (S.D.Ala.1988) (<HOLDING>). We refuse to construct such a restriction out holding the use of a 1951 felony conviction as a predicate for a violation of 18 usc 922g1 did not violate the ex post facto clause because the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm was not committed until after the effective date of the statute under which he was convictedholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that countholding that period of proscription for firearm ownership under section 922g1 was indefiniteholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violation & \n\nthe District Court applied the correct version of the Sentencing Guidelines. See United States v. Bertoli 40 F.3d 1384, 1403 (3d Cir.1994). The ex post facto clause is violated when a court applies a change in the law which is adverse to the interests of a defendant where that change occurred after the commission of the crime. See U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3. Accordingly, when the court in a criminal case is confronted with post-offense amendments which call for a more severe sentence than th ncealment of assets listed in Count One of the indictment was determined by either the evidence produced at trial, or the date the concealment was detected, both of which he claims point to an end date prior to November 2000. See United States v. Bakker, 925 F.2d 728, 739 (4th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Stein, 233 F.3d 6, 18-19 holding that where the date of the offense is not an element of the charge a variance between the indictment date and the proof at trial is not fatal so long as the acts charged were committed within the statute of limitations period and prior to the return date of the indictmentholding that court should not use ending date of indictment as determination of when continuing violation ended but should look at the evidence introduced at trialrecognizing trial court should not weigh evidenceholding that an offer to reimburse plaintiff for costs is not a precondition but an important factor for trial court to look at in determining whether it should grant a new trialholding that valuation should occur on the date of the trial at which property issues are determined & \n\nhave objected to this statement by the prosecutor and to the use of the word \u201cor\u201d in the jury charge on the ground that appellant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment right to due process of law was violated because the information alleged one offense, but the State proved another. It is proper for the jury to be charged in the disjunctive even though the indictment (or information) may allege the differing methods of committing the offense in the conjunctive. Kitchens v. State, 823 S.W.2d 256, 258 (Tex.Crim.App.1991). In this connection, alternative theories of committing the same offense are properly submitted to the jury in the disjunctive if the evidence is sufficient to support a finding under any of the theories submitted. Id; see also Rosales v. State, 4 S.W.3d 228, 231 (Tex.Crim.App.1999) (<HOLDING>). This comports with the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s holding when a statute defines manner or means of committing an offense indictment need not allege matters beyond the language of the statuteholding although indictment may allege manner and means of committing offense in the conjunctive jury may be charged in the disjunctive and a conviction on any method alleged will be upheld if the evidence supports itholding that when an indictment charges several acts in the conjunctive the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts chargedholdingthat an error in instructing the jury that an offense could be committed by a statutory method not charged in the indictment is cured where the court provides the jury with the indictment and instructs jurors that the burden of proof rests upon the state to prove every material allegation of the indictment and every essential element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt citation omittedholding that for purposes of 18 usc 924c1 the law is well established that where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means & \n\nclaiming that the district court failed to consider the effect that one of section 9(l)\u2019s three factors \u2014 the \u201cseriousness of the [defendant\u2019s] offense\u201d \u2014 had on its decision to dismiss without, as opposed to with, prejudice. Id. \u00a7 9(1). We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s dismissal of the indictment without prejudice. United States v. Kurt, 945 F.2d 248, 252 (9th Cir.1991). The district court discussed section 9(l)\u2019s three-factor standard in its June 7, 2002 Order setting Smith\u2019s motion for hearing, and the Government argued the seriousness of Smith\u2019s offense at the hearing. Though the district court did not make an express finding to the effect, Smith\u2019s offense was, in fact, quite serious. See, e.g., United States v. Tummolo, 822 F.Supp. 1561, 1565 (S.D.Fla.1993) (<HOLDING>). Coupled with the district court\u2019s findings on holding that armed robbery suspect was entitled to bail hearing even though armed robbery was considered capital offense under mississippi law because maximum sentence was life imprisonmentholding the imposition of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment was not excessive for conviction of possession of cocaine where defendant was adjudged to be a fourth felony offender with prior convictions for manslaughter two prior convictions for possession of cocaine and numerous arrests for drug offenses possession of a firearm by a felon aggravated battery and armed robberyholding that possession of a firearm by a felon is a serious offense for 3162a2 purposesholding that armed robbery and being a felon in possession are serious offenses for section 91 purposesholding that a conviction for florida armed robbery is a crime of violence under the armed career criminal act & \n\nand claims do not resolve the reasonable debate as to the proper way to correct the obvious error in claim 8. Finally, while it is not entirely clear if it intends this argument to apply in the correction context, we note that Fargo argues that the prosecution history supports only one reasonable construction of claim 8. IRIS maintains, however, that under Novo Industries our inquiry is com p\u00edete if the proper way to correct the error is not apparent from the face of the patent, even if the proper correction is clear from the prosecution history. Fargo is correct in so far as it argues that the prosecution history is to be consulted to determine whether the error is subject to only one reasonable construction. See Hoffer v. Microsoft Corp., 405 F.3d 1326, 1331 (Fed. Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). The error must be evident on the face of the holding that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim must be raised on direct appeal when the facts supporting the claim are presented on the face of the recordholding that when two patents issued from continuationinpart appliea tions derived from one original application the prosecution history of a claim limitation in the first patent to issue was properly applied to the same claim limitation in the second patent to issueholding a technical term used in a patent document is interpreted as having the meaning that it would be given by persons experienced in the field of the invention unless it is apparent from the patent and the prosecution history that the inventor used the term with a different meaningholding that a court can correct a patent claim for a grammatical error where the prosecution history does not suggest a different interpretation of the claimsholding that claim 22 which depends from nonexistent claim 38 could be corrected because the error in the dependency was evident based on the face of the patent and that the correct antecedent claim was apparent from the prosecution history & \n\nAlthough Joseph challenged the constitutionality of the drug-quantity determination in his sentencing memorandum, the Government points out that Dunbar did not make a constitutional challenge in the district court, and argues for plain-error review. The result is the same regardless whether our review is de novo or for plain error. According to the Court, Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury. Alleyne v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (internal citations omitted) (<HOLDING>). However, Joseph and Dunbar do not challenge holding that to apply the firearm enhancement the firearm need only reflect the context of the defendants possession and the defendants ability to use the firearm to promote the controlled substance offenseholding that use certainly includes brandishing a firearm quotation marks omittedholding defendants minimum sentence could not be increased for brandishing a firearm where based on jury instructions jury convicted defendant of the lesser offense of carrying rather than brandishing the firearmholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that the trial court was not entitled to impose a threeyear mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon where the jury verdict did not specifically find actual possession & \n\nand sentence. I. DISCUSSION A Unconstitutionality of 18 U.S.C, \u00a7 922(g) Seneeharles first contends that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional, both facially and as-applied to him, because his possession of the firearm did not have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Because Seneeharles did not object to the constitutionality of the felon-in-possession statute in the district court, we review for plain error. See United States v. Moriarty, 429 F.3d 1012, 1018-19 (11th Cir. 2005) (stating we review constitutional objections \u201cnot raised before the district court only for plain error\u201d). Senecharles\u2019s facial challenge is directly foreclosed by our precedent upholding the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). See United States v. Scott, 263 F.3d 1270, 1273 (11th Cir. 2001) (<HOLDING>). Further, because the parties stipulated the holding that double jeopardy precludes dual convictions for felon in possession of a firearm and felon in possession of separate ammunition because section 790231 florida statutes prohibits possession of any firearm ammunition or electric weapon or device emphasis in originalholding the jurisdictional element of the statute ie the requirement that the felon possess in or affecting commerce any firearm or ammunition immunizes 922g1 from a facial constitutional attackholding that conviction for possession of ammunition by a convicted felon in violation of 18 usc 922g is valid under the commerce clause as long as the ammunition had previously moved in interstate commerce even though the possession did not have a substantial affect on sameholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that dual convictions of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and possession of ammunition by a convicted felon violated double jeopardy & \n\ndefendants also say that the prosecution presented false evidence to the grand jury in order to secure an indictment. We have reviewed the evidence and conclude that there is no evidence to indicate that the government\u2019s testimony and evidence before the grand jury was false. The majority of the arguments presented by the defendants go to the weight and interpretations of the evidence, instead of demonstrating actual false statements made by the government. In addition, many of the arguably false statements appear to be about information that is not material to the case. The Ninth Circuit appears to focus on the materiality of statements when analyzing whether there has been government misconduct that warrants sanctions. See United States v. Kennedy, 564 F.2d 1329, 1338 (9th Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>) Post-Indictment The second argument focus on holding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding that tribal courts are not subject to the fifth amendments requirement of indictment by grand juryholding that the trial court erred in denying the defendants motion in arrest of judgment when the indictment lacked a material element and it was not apparent that the grand jury based the indictment on facts that satisfy this element of the crime and that the only permissible cure was to send the matter back to the grand juryrecognizing that a constructive amendment to an indictment occurs when either the government the court or both broadens the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand juryholding that in the situation of a possible dismissal of an indictment because of possible grand jury tampering only where knowing perjury relating to a material matter has been presented to the grand jury should the trial judge dismiss an otherwise valid indictment & \n\ncreating anger or resentment and a cross burning done with the [constitutionally proscribable] purpose of threatening or intimidating a victim\u201d), 374 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (agreeing that the First Amendment prohibits the conviction of a person for cross burning without the intent to intimidate, but concluding that the number of such convictions likely to occur under the Virginia statute was too small to render the statute facially overbroad). 20 Pet. for Review, State v.

Bagdasarian, 652 F.3d 1113, holding after long discussion of the various opinions in black that that case established that a defendant can be constitutionally convicted of making a true threat only if the defendant intended the recipient of the threat to feel threatenedholding that the district courts finding that an allegedly coercive threat did not specifically motivate the defendants confession where 1 there was no evidence that the threat was repeated at the police station 2 defendant offered no admissible evidence that the threat was the crucial factor motivating his confession and 3 he confessed immediately after the officer threatened to administer a gun residue test as opposed to confessing immediately after the allegedly coercive threat was made thus the gunresidue test was just as plausible a motivating factor for the confession as was the threatholding that an enhancement for an express threat of death may not be applied to the sentence for robbery when the threat is related to the use of the firearm and the defendant has a 924c sentence for the same firearmholding that the statement i have a gun is a threat of deathholding that threat occurring 36 days before possession of firearm not present threat & \n\nof a firearm during and in relation to the drug conspiracy and a carjacking incident) and Count 10 (knowingly possessing a firearm in furtherance of the drug conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute). The pre-sentence report stated that the mandatory minimum terms for these convictions were ten and five years, respectively. The Government objected, arguing that Count 10 constituted a second conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and therefore the mandatory minimum for Count 10 should be 25 years. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) (\u201cIn the case of a second or subsequent conviction under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924], the person shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.... \u201d); Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-33, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993) (<HOLDING>). The probation officer agreed with these holding that 924cs enhanced penalty for a second or subsequent conviction applies when the defendant is convicted of multiple 924c counts in a single proceedingholding that post conviction hearing act is not available to juvenile proceeding since the child is not convicted of a crimeholding that issues underlying all counts were sufficiently intertwined that the separate appeal of the summary judgment counts would complicate the trial of the remaining countsholding that where a statute provides for an enhanced penalty based on a defendants prior conviction the fact of conviction is a sentencing factor to be determined by the court rather than a juryholding that severance was not required when a defendant was charged with five counts of forcible rape two counts of felonious restraint three counts of kidnapping two counts of armed criminal action two counts of forcible sodomy one count of second degree assault one count of first degree robbery and one count of stealing & \n\nnot contest Alaimalo\u2019s actual innocence. B. Prior Opportunities to Raise Actual Innocence Claim We turn to the question of whether Alaimalo\u2019s actual innocence claim was unavailable to him during his direct appeal and his first \u00a7 2255 motion. In making this determination, we consider \u201c(1) wheth er the legal basis for petitioner\u2019s claim did not arise until after he had exhausted his direct appeal and first \u00a7 2255 motion; and (2) whether the law changed in any way relevant to petitioner\u2019s claim after that first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d Harrison, 519 F.3d at 960 (internal quotation marks omitted).

Moreover, at the March 23, 2014 hearing on the State\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to charge her as a habitual offender, Nations\u2019s attorney specifically stated: \u2018Tour honor, we don\u2019t have any opposition [to the State\u2019s motion]. It\u2019s either \u2014 she\u2019s habitual or she\u2019s not. I think that we had already talked and she is in that status.\u201d After Nations\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement, the trial judge granted the State\u2019s motion. It is difficult to imagine a clearer waiver of the issue. Thus, Nations\u2019s claim of unfair surprise is not only without merit but also procedurally barred. Newberry v. State, 85 So.3d 884, 888 (\u00b6 8) (Miss.Ct.App.2011) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we find no error in the trial holding that a noticebased objection to a motion to amend an indictment to charge the defendant as a habitual offender is waived if the defendant fails to make a specific and contemporaneous objectionholding that an objection was adequate when the judge cut short the objection and the defendant was not afforded the opportunity to explain his objection fullyholding a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate reviewholding that a party fails to preserve an evidentiary issue for appeal not only by failing to make a specific objection but also by making the wrong specific objectionholding that defendant waived his objection to the prosecutors use of her peremptory challenges by failing to make a contemporaneous objection during jury selection & \n\n"}

Dr. Klingenschmitt\u2019s second contention is that the court-martial proceedings were fundamentally unfair because they were tainted by impermissible \u201ccommand influence.\u201d PL\u2019s Mot. 33. Of the several examples of alleged improper command influence set forth in his brief, however, only one \u2014 the allegation that the convening authority of the court-martial, Admiral Ruehe, Commander Navy Religion Mid-Atlantic, was an accuser \u2014 was raised before the court-martial. PL\u2019s Mot. 35 (citing AR 1152-71). The other objections based on allegedly improper command influence were not raised and are therefore waived. See Martinez v. United States, 914 F.2d 1486, 1488 (Fed.Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). Dr. Klingenschmitt argues that improper holding that plaintiffs failure to raise his constitutional claims in the military court system bars him from raising them in federal courtholding that where defendant failed to raise defense of plaintiffs fraud in federal court defendant is barred from raising that issue in state courtholding that a defendants failure to object or join in a codefendants objection to an issue bars the defendant from raising the issue on appealholding that failure to raise issue at district court forecloses party from raising same issue on appealholding that the court bars a party from raising an issue on remand that was not raised on appeal & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question.

Henderson, 598 So.2d 1350, 1354 (Ala.1992). \u201cA jury\u2019s award of punitive damages will be considered excessive, as a matter of law, only if: 1) the jury\u2019s decision-making process was tainted by bias, passion, prejudice, or other improper motive; or 2) the verdict goes beyond that necessary to accomplish society\u2019s goals of punishment and deterrence.\u201d Killough v. Jahandarfard, 578 So.2d 1041, 1046 (Ala.1991) (citation omitted). After conducting a hearing under Hammond v. City of Gadsde 436 So.2d 827, 830-31 (Ala.1983) (<HOLDING>); Hutchins v.

Rather, according to the trial court, the express terms of the warrant \"through inadvertence\u201d did not permit as extensive a search as was actually conducted. Thus, it appears the actual basis for the trial court's ruling was that the search exceeded the scope of a valid warrant. 3 . We do not here address the question of whether an appellee may raise an argument in defense of the lower court\u2019s judgment when that argument was not presented in the lower court. We do note, however, that our previous opinions on that question have been somewhat inconsistent. See, e.g., Buehner Block Co. v. UWC Assocs., 752 P.2d 892, 894-95 (Utah 1988) (applying argument raised for first time on appeal to affirm lower court\u2019s decision); American Coal Co. v. Sandstrom, 689 P.2d 1, 4 (Utah 1984) (<HOLDING>); L & M Corp. v. Loader, 688 P.2d 448, 449-50 holding that 1252d1 bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below and of general issues that were not raised below but not of specific subsidiary legal arguments or arguments by extension that were not made belowholding that arguments not raised below are waived for appealholding that petitioners had abandoned arguments not raised belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding that an issue not properly preserved below in the district court is generally waived & \n\nand in general, \u201ca reviewing court will not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d See In re Cannon, 277 F.3d 838, 848 (6th Cir.2002). In any case, the record indicates that Matthews and Owens in fact received notice \u201creasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d See Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950). Here, Matthews and Owens received actual notice by mail \u2014 as they admit \u2014 which set forth the claim deadline in bold lettering and unambiguously warned them of the ramifications of inaction. See Dusenbery v. United States, 534 U.S. 161, 170-73, 122 S.Ct. 694, 151 L.Ed.2d 597 (2002) (<HOLDING>).

In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\ndistrict courts should handle motions by the government to reconsider suppression orders. When the government seeks reconsideration of a suppression order based on a new legal argument or evidence, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits require the government to justify its failure to present this legal argument or evidence in the earlier proceedings. See United States v. Villabona-Gamica, 63 F.3d 1051, 1055 (11th Cir. 1995) (\u201cBy failing to raise an issue at a suppression hearing without offering any justification therefor, the government waives its right to assert it in subsequent proceedings.\u201d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted) (quoting, in parenthetical, United States v. Thompson, 710 F.2d 1500, 1504 (11th Cir.1983))); McRae v. United States, 420 F.2d 1283, 1288 (D.C.Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, the Second, Fifth, holding that our court will not consider an issue of whether a defendant has standing to seek suppression of evidence if the issue was not raised in the lower courtholding that where an issue is raised in the district court but raised late and the district court declines to deem the issue waived the issue may be raised on appealholding that suppression issue not raised to the district court was waived under rule 12holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that the government was obligated to advance stronger justification for relitigating a suppression issue where the issue raised was clear and a considered ruling had been made & \n\nhave changed the jury\u2019s decision to impose a death sentence. See Gissendaner, 272 Ga. at 713-714 (10) (b) (reviewing alleged impropriety that was not objected to at trial solely for the purpose of determining if a death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor in violation of OCGA \u00a7 17-10-35 (c) (D). 9. In addition to his claim above regarding unsworn and allegedly false testimony, Martin argues that the trial court erred by permitting victim impact testimony that was improper in other ways. Because Martin failed to both raise objections and obtain rulings on them regarding any of the allegedly objectionable statements, he has forfeited his right to appeal under ordinary appellate review standards. See Smith, 287 Ga. at 30 (3) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, we conclude under the \u201cplain holding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that a party may not raise a claim on appeal that was not presented to the trial courtholding that a party must obtain a distinct ruling on an issue in order to raise it on appealholding that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal & \n\nwith the meaning of the word \u2018appeal\u2019 in the context of [Article] VI, Section 27.\u201d Hicks, 105 N.M. at 287, 731 P.2d at 983. {23} In Hicks, this Court held that, because criminal actions in metropolitan court were not of record at that time, \u201cthe right of appeal in such actions is the right to a trial or hearing de novo in the district court[, and] [i]n de novo proceedings, the district court is not in any way bound by the proceedings in the lower court.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). We held that the district court was required to independently determine whether the requirements of the metropolitan court were complied with and thus remanded the case to district court to make such a determination. Id. Compare State v. Spillman, 2010-NMCA-019, \u00b6 6, 147 N.M. 676, 227 P.3d 1058 (filed 2009) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, holding that where a defendant fails to challenge his plea in district court he must establish plain errorholding that before a defendant could contest the validity of a plea entered in metropolitan court by appealing to district court he had to first move to set aside his plea in metropolitan court because in an ontherecord appeal to district court that court is the equivalent of an appellate courtholding that the district court had jurisdiction to order restitution of award overturned on appeal even in the absence of a remand from the appellate courtholding that because a claim was never raised in the district court this court would not consider it for the first time on appealholding that if the defendant fails to file a motion in the trial court to withdraw his plea he cannot attack it for the first time on appeal & \n\nin the trial court on the grounds now asserted, defendant is deemed to have waived the objection on appeal. CRE 103; People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965 (Colo.App.1983). Kruse, 819 P.2d at 551 (Van Cise, J., dissenting). We agree with Judge Van Cise. The protection provided by section 16-8-107(1) should not have been addressed by the court of appeals. The general rule is that failure to make a timely and sufficient objection during the trial constitutes a waiver of that ground on appeal. Larkin v. People, 177 Colo. 156, 160, 493 P.2d 1, 3 (1972); People v. Browning, 809 P.2d 1086, 1088 (Colo.App.1990). Kruse waived his objection to the admission of Ortiz\u2019s testimony under section 16-8-107(1) by failing to properly object at trial. People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965, 966-67 (Colo.App.1983) (<HOLDING>). An exception to the general rule exists, holding that defendant must have clearly objected at trial to the matter he is raising on appealholding that appellate court could not consider objection to testimony when defendant objected at trial on different groundsholding that error was preserved when defendant objected to question regarding defendant was under arrest immediately following question about postarrest event sufficient to put trial court on notice of appellants state constitutional grounds for objectionholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewholding that claims based on grounds not objected to at trial cannot be considered on appeal & \n\nand Ek sold the vessel with the anchor, rope, and chain still on it. Even if Ek did misappropriate these items, Peterson does not have standing to assert the claim of a third party. Standing in this court is a rule of judicial self-restraint that asks whether the person raising a particular claim is a \" 'proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue.' \u201d Moore v. State, 553 P.2d 8, 23 n. 25 (Alaska 1976) (quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 100-01, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968)). We cannot consider the purported transfer of the materials lien from Dockery to Peterson because it was not in the record before the superior court and was improperly included in Peterson's excerpt of record. Alaska R.App. P. 210. See also B.B. v. D.D., 18 P.3d 1210, 1214 (Alaska 2001) (<HOLDING>).

The doctrine of issue preclusion \u201ccomes into play when an issue involved in a prior decision is the same issue involved in a subsequent action.\u201d See Mabry v. State Bd. of Community Colleges & Occupational Educ., 813 F.2d 311, 316 (10th Cir.1987). If the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover order, which the debtors did not appeal, \u201cactually and necessarily decided\u201d the exemption issue, principles of issue preclusion could prevent the debtors from raising this argument in an appeal from a subsequent order. See id. (noting that issue preclusion does not apply unless \u201cthe issue is actually decided in the first action\u201d and \u201cit was necessary to decide the issue in disposing of the first action\u201d); see also In re Albrecht, 233 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Turshen v. Chapman, 823 F.2d 836, 839 (4th holding that court lacked jurisdiction on appeal from injunction because the order was simply an interpretation of an earlier orderholding that under the doctrine of direct estoppel a law firms failure to appeal the bankruptcy courts earlier order barred it from challenging the courts holding on its appeal from a subsequent orderholding that an issue not raised on direct appeal of sentence is barred by the law of the case from presentation in a subsequent appealholding that notice indicating appeal was from judgment on date of jury verdict was insufficient to preserve appeal from earlier order granting summary judgmentholding that under the law of the case doctrine an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal & \n\nTherefore, it was an allegation based on speculation and conjecture. The trial court conducted a hearing, at which Walker could have pursued this legal theory, objected to the State\u2019s alleged lack of evidence of probable cause to arrest, presented evidence to support his allegation, and argued that the lack of evidence required that his statement be suppressed. Walker, however, remained silent; he did not pursue this issue in the trial court; and he did not allow the trial court the opportunity to prevent the alleged injustice. See Adams v. State, 585 So.2d 161, 164 (Ala.l991)(\u201cMatters not objected to at trial cannot be considered for the first time on appeal, since review on appeal applies only to rulings by the trial court.\u201d)- Cf. Coulliette v. State, 857 So.2d 793, 795 (Ala.2003)(<HOLDING>). Walker\u2019s silence and abandonment of this holding that an appellate court considers the entire record on appeal not just the evidence presented at the suppression hearing in affirming the denial of a motion to suppressholding that issues not raised before the trial court cannot be raised on appealholding issues not raised in appellate brief are waivedholding that issues not raised in the trial court may not be raised later on appealholding that because a specific argument raised on appeal was not presented at suppression hearing the motion to suppress did not give the trial court notice of the specific issues the defendant raised in his appellate brief therefore the trial court did not have the opportunity to rectify these alleged errors the defendants motion was not sufficient to preserve the issues presented by him in his brief quoting aeree v state 673 so2d 855 856 alacrimapp1995 & \n\nclaims are defaulted, but Louisiana prisoners can benefit from the Martinez\/Trevino exception to the procedural-default, rule if they can show that they have a substantial IATC claim and received IAC from state habeas counsel. As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v.

Gen. Laws ch. 152, \u00a7 24 are determined by the judge, justiciable by motion. Anzalone v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Authority, 403 Mass. 119, 125, 526 N.E.2d 246, 249 (1988); Foley v. Polaroid Corp., 381 Mass. 545, 548, 413 N.E.2d 711, 713 (1980); Catalano v. First Essex Sav. Bank, 37 Mass.App.Ct. 377, 381, 639 N.E.2d 1113, 1116 (1994). It is reasonable to infer that the Verdict and Judgment followed the State Court judge\u2019s consideration and denial of motions to invoke the exclusivity clause under the Act, M.G.L. c. 152, \u00a7 24. In Massachusetts, that level of adjudication is sufficient to provide preclu-sive effect for the issue underlying the motion in a subsequent forum. Jarosz v. Palmer, 49 Mass.App.Ct. 834, 836, 733 N.E.2d 164, 167 (2000) (<HOLDING>) aff'd 436 Mass. 526, 531, 766 N.E.2d 482, 488 holding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that an evidentiary hearing is necessary only if the party requesting the hearing raises a significant disputed factual issueholding that an evidentiary hearing or jury trial is not necessary for an issue to have preclusive effect if it was properly raised in the prior proceeding was submitted for determination and was actually determined citing restatement second of judgments 27 cmt dholding that the disputed issue with respect to the state law bar was properly submitted to the juryholding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars readjudication of issues when 1 the prior suit resulted in judgment on the merits 2 identical issues are involved 3 the issue was actually litigated 4 the issue was actually determined and 5 the determination was necessary to the resulting judgment & \n\nchallenge a vehicle search from passenger standing to seek suppression of evidence discovered in a vehicle as the fruit of an unlawful stop, detention, or arrest.\u201d). Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Because there is no evidence in this case holding that plain error review is appropriate unless there is some evidence that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of a particular argumentholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\na statutory argument that Shepard and Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) should be applied to a district court\u2019s categorization of a particular prior conviction for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1 (i.e., whether the conviction was a drug offense, a crime of violence, and not related to the other conviction), or how the district court should arrive at that categorization when sentencing under an advisory guidelines system. Thus, he has waived that argument. See United States v. Duncan, 400 F.3d 1297, 1299 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to address the Booker implications of firearm and role enhancements because appellant did not challenge those enhancements in his initial brief); see also Wilkerson v.

The reasons for this exception include that the union does not owe a duty of fair representation to persons who ax*e not members of the collective-bargaining unit and the possibility of potential conflicts of interest between retirees and active employees. Id. {\u00b6 32} Rutledge has been followed in a number of subsequent decisions. See, e.g., Featherstone v. Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. (Mar. 30, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-889, 1999 WL 177561, *3 (<HOLDING>). The board contends that these cases are holding that trial court properly granted motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because plaintiff had failed to exhaust remedies available through exclusive grievance procedureholding that a prisoner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he did not utilize grievance procedures that permitted waiver of the time limit for good causeholding that a retired teacher did not fail to exhaust administrative remedies because he was not subject to the grievance procedure in the collectivebargaining agreementholding that plaintiff could not look to the courts for relief because he did not exhaust his administrative remedies under the adeaholding that a plaintiff need not exhaust his administrative remedies to bring a retaliation claim & \n\nthis element.by showing either (1) the defendant \u201cis enabled to commit the predicate offenses solely by virtue of his position in the enterprise or involvement in or control over the affairs of the enterprise\u201d or (2) \u201cthe.predicate offenses are related to the activities of that enterprise.\u201d App. at 4689-90, see United States v.

The government does not have to show that the defendant\u2019s motive in committing the predicate act was to further the affairs of the enterprise. In fact, a defendant can commit a predicate act that is detrimental to the enterprise so long as the evidence establishes the requisite nexus between the predicate act and the enterprise. Pro-venzano, at 200 (<HOLDING>). D. Evidence of Uncharged Acts. Irizarry recognizing that by accepting bribes in exchange for allowing violations of a collective bargaining agreement the defendant was conducting the rico enterprise local union through racketeering activity even though the union was harmed by the racketeering activityholding that an employee may sue for breach of a collective bargaining agreement without the unionholding that union members had standing to bring rico claims for reduced compensation under collective bargaining agreementholding that there was abundant evidence to support the charge against a union member for helping organize a nonaflcio local union of a different name where the union member admitted at the hearing that he contacted local contractors for the purpose of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement for new union and serving as the new unions business managerholding that to prevail under civil rico plaintiff must prove that defendants participated in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity & \n\nJersey Racing Comm\u2019n, 113 F.3d 1313, 1318 (3d Cir. 1997) (\u201cIn order to succeed on a claim of deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to termination of a specific employment position, a plaintiff must first establish a property interest in the employment.\u201d) (citing Board of Regents of State Colleges v.

The burden thus shifts to Davis to show that holding that court erred as matter of law in failing to enter judgment for employer at close of plaintiffs implied employment contract actionholding that once the plaintiffs fixed term of employment expired he had no property interest as a matter of lawholding that plaintiffs had no vested interest in former interpretation of state lawholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that an assistant professor hired for a fixed term of one academic year had no property interest in his job because the terms of his employment allowed that his contract not be renewed & \n\ncontract, because the cause of action did not \u201carise under the agreement but [was] merely related to it.\u201d Id. 3 . Language in section 301(a) of the LMRA strongly suggests that its requirements are necessary to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on the federal courts: The action \"may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.\" 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a); see also Steel Co. v.

This reading is consistent with our precedent. See Majestic Housing, 743 F.2d at 1345 (<HOLDING>). Thus, a failure to state a claim under holding dispute under collective bargaining agreement not arbitrable as delegation of nondelegable authority without reference to whether provision was consented to by partiesholding that a complaint for interference with a collective bargaining agreement against a nonparty to that agreement is not actionable under 301a of the lmraholding that a debtorinpossession could reject a collective bargaining agreementholding that mere reference to a collective bargaining agreement does not confer federal question jurisdiction under section 301aholding that the mere delivery of documents does not confer jurisdiction & \n\nthat Plaintiffs Complaint is untimely. As already noted, it is undisputed that the Union convened plant employees at a meeting on December 20, 2001 to discuss the two-year extension to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. Plaintiff did not attend that meeting. On May 17, 2002, Plaintiff filed a charge with the NLRB asserting a claim arising out of the same facts alleged here. Obviously, then, Plaintiff was aware of the facts giving rise to this cause of action by May 17th at the latest. The present Complaint, however, was filed on August 9, 2004, well over two years after that date. Accordingly, Plaintiffs claims under 101(a)(1) and 101(a)(2) are untimely under the applicable statute of limitations. See Burd v. New Jersey Tel. Co., 149 N.J.Super. 20, 30, 372 A.2d 1355 (App.Div.1977) (<HOLDING>), affd, 76 N.J. 284, 386 A.2d 1310 (1978).

Here, there is no express requirement in the holding that a union officials comments may be used to infer the object of union activityrecognizing that union members interests are adequately represented by the unionrecognizing violations of section 101a1 where union officials circulated inadequate or misleading information about matters to be voted uponholding that a rico action by union members was properly dismissed where any financial improprieties occurred with union funds and directly injured solely the unionholding no right under section 101a1 to vote on matters relating to collective bargaining agreements & \n\nwhen he signed off from the ship after the end of the voyage, they complied with the Seafarer\u2019s Agreement, as well as the applicable law (Docket # 42.

O). Plaintiffs have not contested that Co-plaintiff Plesha signed off on August of 2001 when the voyage concluded (Docket #42 SUF No. 34). It follows that Defendants\u2019 payment of unearned wages until August of 2001 complied with the terms and conditions of the Seafarer\u2019s Agreement signed by Co-plaintiff Plesha. As such, Plaintiffs\u2019 claim on this respect must fail. Blainey, 990 F.2d at 891-92 (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 motion for summary holding that absent a law or collective bargaining agreement a municipal employee is an employee atwillholding that where the statutory scheme is clear the inquiry should endholding that an arbitrators interpretation of the scope of the issue submitted to him is entitled to the same deference accorded his interpretation of the collective bargaining agreementholding that order reducing the notice of a claim of lien was not interim in the sense of being an intermediate step toward a further end rather it is an end in itself for its very purpose is to clarify the parties rights in the interim period pending a final decision on the meritsholding that absent a collective bargaining agreement which extends the employment period past the end of a particular voyage a seaman is entitled to unearned wages until the end of the voyage & \n\nhowever, between the public interest asserted here and the public interest present in Dep\u2019t of Navy. In Dep\u2019t of Navy, this court held that collective bargaining was in the public interest, and the union, as the chosen bargaining representative, was the party specifically designated by Congress to further that public interest. In this case, by contrast, Congress has authorized the contracting federal agency and the Department of Labor to safeguard the public interest embodied in the Davis-Bacon Act by giving them the power to enforce the statute. Although we do not decide the issue, it is likely that the Union has no private cause of action against the employer for Davis-Bacon Act violations. Cf. Weber v. Heat Control Co., 579 F.Supp. 346 (D.N.J.1982), aff'd, 728 F.2d 599 (3d Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>). But the mere fact that federal agencies are holding that the employees of government contractors do not have a cause of action for back pay against employers who violate the davisbacon actholding in fca suit regarding contractors classification of employees for purposes of the davisbacon act that deferral to the department of labor was proper only with respect to the resolution of how particular types of work should be classified but not with respect to whether the contractors misclassified their employeesholding that an award of back pay is an issue for the courtholding that court would not imply a statutory cause of action for employers interference in employees assertion of claim for compensationrecognizing the cause of action & \n\nto do so, one being the plaintiffs failure to respond to several of the defendant\u2019s grounds for dismissal.

Defendants argue that the term \u201cparties\u201d encompasses individual employees as well as the collective bargaining unit, while Plaintiffs dispute that interpretation.

The Board recognizes two limited exceptions to requiring an employer to bargain to impasse: \u201c[w]hen a union, in response to an employer\u2019s diligent and earnest efforts to engage in bargaining, insists on continually avoiding or delaying bargaining, and when economic exigencies compel prompt action.\u201d Id. The mandatory subjects of bargaining include \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). Employees\u2019 workloads, such as the number of rooms a housekeeper must clean at issue here, is a mandatory subject of bargaining. See HTH, 2011 WL 2414720, at *6 (<HOLDING>); see also Beacon Piece Dyeing & Finishing Co., holding that the district courts erroneous rulings violated respondents sixth amendment right to paid counsel of his choosingholding that the number of rooms that housekeepers must clean is a mandatory subject of bargainingholding that respondents violated 8a1 and 5 of the act uni laterally changing the housekeepers workloads by adding two additional rooms to clean per dayholding that the limitation act does not apply to claims brought under the clean water actholding that the government did not have to prove that the defendant knew that his acts violated the clean water act but merely that he was aware of the conduct that resulted in the permits violation & \n\nexecute their duties as police officers. Thus, this type of communication falls squarely within the scope of speech as a public employee under Garcetti. Moreover, the fact that plaintiff also copied the Memorandum to next level of supervision (i.e., the Village Board) does not alter the analysis in this case. The fact that plaintiff not only expressed the grievance to his immediate supervisor, but also to the entity ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the police department is simply further evidence that this speech was not citizen speech; rather, the Memorandum \u2014 whether required or not\u2014 was clearly pursuant to his duties as a police officer.

Washington, 653 So.2d at 364 (\u201cAlthough a warrantless search is per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the search will be considered lawful if conducted pursuant to consent which was given voluntarily and freely.\u201d (citing Norman v.

See Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313, 317, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654 (1921) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, consent has been deemed to be holding that consent to search premises includes consent to search washing machine on those premisesholding that consent was coerced when officers told defendants wife they came to search the premises and she allowed them to enterholding that a landlord cannot validly consent to a search of a tenants apartment despite ownership and legal authority to enter the premisesholding consent involuntary when police told defendants grandmother they had a search warrant and she allowed them to enter and searchholding that a defendants consent to accompany dea agents from the detroit airport to the dea office was voluntary when she was asked to accompany the officers there were no threats or show of force and the officers told her twice that she could decline to consent & \n\nthe consent, the presence of intervening circumstances, and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d United States v. Santa, 236 F.3d 662, 677 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe proper inquiry is not simply whether [Mr. Scott\u2019s] will was overborne by the agents\u2019 illegal entry, but also whether his consent was a \u201cproduct\u201d of that illegality.\u201d Id. Considering these factors, we conclude that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was not tainted by the illegal protective sweep of his home. To be sure, Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was obtained minutes after the illegal protective sweep was completed. And we recognize that the fact that Mr. Scott was apprised of his right to refuse the search does not constitute an intervening factor sufficient to dissipate the taint of the illegal sweep. Id. at 678 (<HOLDING>). However, the officers\u2019 conduct in this case, recognizing that unconstitutionally obtained evidence can become so attenuated as to dissipate the taintholding that the reading of miranda warnings and the signing of a waiver of fourth and fifth amendment rights are not sufficient intervening factors sufficient to dissipate the taint of an unlawful entry into a homeholding that consent to search did not purge the taint of an unlawful detention when no intervening circumstances sufficiently separated the consent from the unlawful detentionholding that because miranda warnings make defendant aware of right to counsel and of consequences of waiving sixth amendment rights defendants waiver of right to counsel after receiving such warnings is validholding that although defendant was a deputy sheriff miranda warnings were required irrespective of defendants knowledge of his fifth amendment rights & \n\ninstead, the dispute is whether the consent was voluntary. ANALYSIS The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution states that it is \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in then-persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable seizures ... and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. Evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment shall not be admissible at trial. See Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 657, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (\u201c[T]he exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments .... \u201d); Sing v.

In Royer, a case originating in Florida, the holding that consent was coerced when officers told defendants wife they came to search the premises and she allowed them to enterholding that defendants consent was involuntary where defendant consented to search following a warrantless entry and officers explained that absent consent the officers would obtain a warrantholding consent invalid when given under coercive circumstances in which police misrepresented that they had a warrant to search the homeholding that search of backpack constituted a search of defendants person and was not authorized by search warrant for premisesholding consent involuntary when police told defendants grandmother they had a search warrant and she allowed them to enter and search & \n\nomitted). Accord, e.g., United States v. Bailey, 691 F.2d 1009, 1014 & n. 3 (11th Cir.1982) (\u2018Voluntary\u201d means not caused by police misconduct); United States v. Barber, 557 F.2d 628, 632 (8th Cir.1977) (evidence left in police car after illegal arrest held inadmissible because discovery of the evidence was a direct result of the unconstitutional seizure of defendant\u2019s person); United States v. Newman, 490 F.2d 993, 995 (10th Cir.1974) (drugs left behind as a result of illegal search of rear compartment of camper held inadmissible). Of course, if the abandonment is truly voluntary \u2014 i.e., not caused by police misconduct \u2014 evidence found is admissible even if there was a prior or subsequent illegal search or seizure. E.g., United States v. Pirolli, 673 F.2d 1200, 1204 (11th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Kelly, 551 F.2d 760, 763 recognizing that trial court properly left the door open for defendant to prove its defenses to the fed complaintholding that when a police officer observes something from an area where the officer is lawfully entitled to be anything that is in open view may be observed without having to obtain a search warrant because making such open view observations does not constitute a search in the constitutional senseholding tacit consent to search of person was insufficient to prove consent to search bags where bags were not in defendants actual possession defendant merely pointed out bags at officers request and officer never specifically asked for consent to search bagsholding that abandonment was not caused by police misconduct where defendant left bags in open view before officers had knocked on door to gain admission because officers had not yet done anything illegalholding that no search occurred when police officers entered an open business & \n\nMr. Belcher testified that he was able to remove the radio from the van.

Indiana courts have defined false imprisonment as \"the unlawful restraint upon one's freedom of movement or the deprivation of one\u2019s liberty without consent.\u201d Miller v. City of Anderson, 777 N.E.2d 1100, 1104 (Ind.Ct.App.2002). Indiana courts have stated also that \"[a] defendant may be liable for false arrest when he or she arrests the plaintiff[s] in the absence of probable cause to do so.\u201d Id. The circumstances of this procedural due process claim do not involve false arrest or false imprisonment under Indiana tort law. Therefore, these exceptions to the law enforcement immunity provision do not apply. 7 . See, e.g., East Chicago Police Dep\u2019t v. Bynum, 826 N.E.2d 22, 26 (Ind.Ct.App.2005) (<HOLDING>); City of Hammond v. Reffitt, 789 N.E.2d 998, holding police officers were entitled to immunity where the officers decided not to arrest an intoxicated driver who subsequently died of hypothermia in his vehicleholding that police officers were not entitled to immunity under the itca law enforcement immunity provision where the officers violated their statutory duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all individuals while acting within the scope of their employmentholding officers engaged in search entitled to immunityholding that even if the plaintiff had asserted a cause of action under the virginia wrongful death act against the city police officers the police officers would be entitled to sovereign immunityholding that officers were entitled to qualified immunity where defendant officers could have reasonably believed that they were given sufficient third party consent to search & \n\nArk. 142, 60 S.W.3d 464 (2001); Caldwell v. State, 780 A.2d 1037 (Del. 2001); State v. Paul, 62 P.3d 389 (Okla.Crim. App.2003). Many of these states simply cited a case from the federal circuit that covers the state to support their approach to this issue. {33} We disagree with the reasoning of the Seventh and Fifth Circuits and the state courts that follow them because it ignores the scope requirement of the second-prong of the Terry test, which our case law has consistently recognized as appropriate to analyze traffic stops. As we said in Werner, an officer\u2019s actions during the \u201cinvestigatory detention must be reasonably related to the circumstances that initially justified the stop.\u201d 117 N.M. at 317, 871 P.2d at 973; see, e.g., Taylor, 1999-NMCA-022, \u00b6 20, 126 N.M. 569, 973 P.2d 246 (<HOLDING>). We feel the cases relied upon by the Seventh holding that police officers are entitled to conduct an investigatory stop of a motorist if they have reasonable suspicion that the motorist has committed a traffic violationholding that where police officers had stopped a vehicle because they suspected that the motorist was intoxicated irrespective of whether the deputies were justified in detaining the motorist after he showed no signs of intoxication and even if they had not after approaching the motorist observed conditions raising a reasonable and articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot they were entitled to ask the motorist for permission to search his vehicleholding that defendant was unreasonably seized under fourth amendment when officer detained him to ask questions unrelated in scope to the reasons that justified the initial traffic stopholding that for purposes of determining whether the roadblock worked a fourth amendment seizure the controlling considerations are whether 1 the motorist was meant to be stopped by the physical obstacle of the roadblock and 2 the motorist was so stoppedholding that any questions an officer asks of a stopped motorist must be reasonably related to the circumstances which justified his initial stop & \n\ndecision that Detective Clark was not entitled to rely in good faith on the warrant issued by the commissioner. Whether a law enforcement officer reasonably relied upon a subsequently invalidated search warrant is a legal question which we review de novo. See United States v. Koerth, 312 F.3d 862, 865 (7th Cir.2002). A. The Foundations and Purpose of the Exclusionary Rule Simply stated, \u201c[t]he exclusionary rule operates to prevent the Government from using evidence seized as the result of an illegal search in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\u201d United States v. McGough, 412 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2005). It has existed, in some form, as part of our constitutional jurisprudence for over one hundred years. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 638, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886) (<HOLDING>). Although commentators have articulated holding statute requiring parties in tax suit to take notice of subsequent pleadings was not unconstitutional when city failed to take such noticeholding that where it was erroneous for the district court to take judicial notice it certainly cannot be said that such notice was mandatory and therefore ire 201d is inapplicableholding that a notice to produce personal papers was unconstitutional and void and that the inspection by the district attorney of said invoice when produced in obedience to said notice and its admission in evidence by the court were erroneous and unconstitutional proceedingsholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitionerholding that a defendant is not entitled to relief from default judgment because notice to an attorney of filing of motions and orders is constructive notice to the client even when the client did not have actual notice & \n\nsituation.\u201d Id. at 396-97. Nevertheless, the applicable standard is an objective one: \u201c[T]he question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d Id. at 397. In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him. This search revealed that Wilke degree of force is necessary, gratuitous acts against a person who has been seized might violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. Phelps v. Coy, 286 F.3d 295, 297, 301-02 (6th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Santos, 287 F.3d at 853 (explaining that holding that suspect was not in custody when officer handcuffed him for officer safety while transporting him to police stationholding that defendant was arrested when the police officer took physical custody of him by grabbing his arm and returned him to the hotel for detention thererecognizing the necessity of analyzing officer coys use of force against phelps in segments where coy arrested phelps placed him in handcuffs took him to the police station for booking and then beat him after he raised his leg in a manner that coy perceived to be a threat to another police officerholding the defendant was not under arrest when police asked him to go to the station and then offered him a ride because he did not have transportationholding that police executed an illegal arrest when they took a teenage suspect from his home and brought him in handcuffs to the police station for questioning & \n\nin Berry, 670 F.2d at 597, did say that \u2018The more intrusive on an individual's freedom complying with a request would be, the greater should be the skepticism with which a court treats assertions that an individual consented to a request\u201d; but this does not determine when consent was given, however, or suggest less validity to an acquiescence voluntarily and intelligently extended.

See, e.g., United States v. Erwin, 875 F.2d 268, 269-70 (10th Cir.1989), in which the court recognized the distinction to be drawn between \u201cstanding to challenge a stop and standing to challenge a search.\u201d The court pointed out, citing, inter alia, Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 484, 83 S.Ct. at 415, 9 L.Ed.2d at 453, that \u201c[e]ven if defendant lacks standing to challenge the search of the car, if the initial stop was illegal, the seized contraband is subject to exclusion under the 'fruit of the poison tree\u2019 doctrine.\u201d 875 F.2d at 269 n. 2. In United States v. Hill, 855 F.2d 664, 666 (10th Cir.1988) the court excluded evidence seized incident to an illegal arrest. Other cases and treatise writers have gone even further. E.g. United States v. Durant, 730 F.2d 1180, 1182 (8th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Williams, 589 F.2d 210, 214 holding that the government must proffer clear evidence of an independent untainted investigation that inevitably would have uncovered the same evidence as that discovered through the illegal searchholding that a passenger has standing to challenge a stops constitutionality because the passenger is seized from the moment a car is stoppedholding that it is clear that hearsay evidence is admissible in a hearing on a motion to suppressholding that the consent of the driver was invalid when the officer knew that the passenger was the owner of the automobilerecognizing that a passenger in an automobile that is stopped may on the basis that it was illegal move to suppress evidence uncovered as a direct result of the stop & \n\nof fact in a Terry stop). Where, as here, police officers themselves are responsible for the mistake (as opposed to police functionaries), the application of the rule is more efficacious still. But ignoring these deficiencies, and assuming without finding that Swierk and Mitchell simply misheard Antone say \u201ccome on\u201d (when he really said \u201chold on\u201d), the Court finds that an objectively reasonable police officer would not have believed that Antone consented to the entry of his home. As previously discussed, Det. Swierk asked Antone whether he would come to the police station, and Antone said that he would. To a reasonable person, Antone\u2019s unsolicited statement, \u201ccome on,\u201d would have been a puzzling follow up to Det. Swierk\u2019s introduction and question. Cf. Marshall, 348 F.3d at 286-88 (<HOLDING>). The statement that the detectives thought holding that acquiescence to a strip and body cavity search did not extend the scope of defendants consent to search his person because of the highly intrusive nature of the searchholding that when reasonable suspicion exists a school search will be permissible in its scope when the measures adopted are reasonably related to the objectives of the searchholding that the government must prove the defendant knew of the features of the firearm that brought it within the scope of the actholding that the challenged item was within the scope of the search because it reasonably fell within the expressed object of the search even though it turned out to be the defendants personal propertyholding that where defendant consented to search of his car and stood by as agent conducted a thorough and systematic search which included removal of vehicles back seat and raising of cars rear quarter panel defendants failure to object to search indicated search was within scope of consent & \n\nthat refusal may be admissible in a subsequent prosecution; (2) if the person refuses to submit to the taking of the specimen, the person\u2019s license to operate a motor vehicle will be automatically suspended, whether or not the person is subsequently prosecuted as a result of the arrest, for not less than 180 days;.... The statute was later amended to also require a warning that \"if the person refuses to submit to the taking of a specimen, the officer may apply for a warrant authorizing a specimen to be taken from the person.\u201d Act of May 23, 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S. ch. 674 \u00a7 2011 Tex. Sess. Law serv. 1627 (West). 3 . The fact that Barker\u2019s comments were in response to Appellant\u2019s questions does not by itself render the trooper\u2019s statements non-coercive. See, e.g., Hall, 649 S.W.2d 627 (<HOLDING>). It is, however, a factor to consider. holding that the issue of the voluntariness of a settlement agreement is waived on appeal if not raised before the boardholding that because of the factbound nature of the inquiry determination of voluntariness of consent to search is reviewed for clear errorrecognizing that the ultimate question of the voluntariness of consent is one of lawholding that the evidence raised the issue of voluntariness of consent even though the officers comments were in response to an inquiry by the suspectrecognizing that consent is an exception to the warrant requirement and that voluntariness of consent depends on the totality of the circumstances & \n\nthe district court\u2019s determination that Boswell consented to the search. If Boswell had authority over the case, whether joint or sole, then he had authority to consent to its search. We conclude that, bas that authority to consent to a search of property does not necessarily translate into authority to search specific containers. See Welch, 4 F.3d at 764 (\u201cThe shared control of \u2018host\u2019 property does not serve to forfeit the expectation of privacy in containers within that property.\u201d). However, in the cases in which we have held that there was not actual or apparent authority for a third party to consent to a search we have found that there was some fact that made it unreasonable for the officer to believe that the third party had authority over the container. See, e.g., id. at 764-65 (<HOLDING>). Here, Boswell\u2019s statement that he did not holding that it was unreasonable to believe that womans boyfriend had authority to consent to the search of her purse even though he had authority to consent to the search of the car in which it was keptholding that it was objectively reasonable for the police to conclude that the general consent to search the respondents car included consent to search a bag within that carholding that search of defendants purse which he carried was authorized by a warrant to search his personholding that the defendants consent to allow the officer to search her purse by way of holding it open for the officer was for consent to a limited view of the purses interior not to surrender possession for an unrestricted search and thus the officer exceeded the scope of the defendants consentholding that the question of whether police had a reasonable basis for finding that a third party had authority to consent to search is a question of law & \n\nstandard for searches of the two. In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its application of law to those facts de novo. United States v. Gibson, 708 F.3d 1256, 1274 (11th Cir. 2013). All facts are construed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below, in this case, the government. Id. The Fourth Amendment guarantees: \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d U.S. Const, amend.

Carter, 566 F.3d 970, 973-75 holding that a probationers challenge to a condition of his probation was moot in light of the supreme courts reversal of the underlying conviction and the probationers apparent completion of probation holding search provision in probation order constitute a reasonable and necessary element of the courts regulation of probationers which did not require the defendants consentholding search of probationers computer by probation officers was reasonable even in absence of a search provision when conditions on probationers computer use reduced his expectation of privacy in his computerholding that a roommate with shared access to anothers computer has common authority over the computer and can grant consent to searchholding warrantless search of probationers home by law enforcement officer for investigatory purposes was reasonable when conditions of probation included a search term and search was supported by reasonable suspicion & \n\nEvans rationale would seem inapplicable whenever the mistake was instead attributable to the law enforcement agency\u201d); cf. Groh v. Ramirez, 540 U.S. 551, 564, 124 S.Ct. 1284, 157 L.Ed.2d 1068 (2004) (stating, in the context of qualified immunity, that \u201cbecause petitioner [police officer] prepared the invalid warrant, he may not argue that he reasonably relied on the Magistrate\u2019s assurance that the warrant contained an adequate description of the things to be seized\u201d). But see United States v. De Leon-Reyna, 930 F.2d 396, 401 (5th Cir.1991) (en banc) (applying good faith exception to a police officer\u2019s m heard is at best ambiguous, and nearly nonsensical in light of the immediately preceding exchange.

Moreover, as noted above, there was no holding cotenants consent to search valid where rodriguez who was asleep inside the house was not asked for his consent if police reasonably believed the consenter possessed common authority over the premisesholding that the insurer is not bound by acts of the agent which are beyond the scope of his authority when the insured has notice of the limitations upon an agents authority or when the circumstances are sufficient to suggest that an inquiry should be made as to such limitationsholding that a principal is not hable for the actions of an agent when these actions exceed the agents authority and the thirdparty has knowledge that the agent does not have the authority assertedholding that when an agent has limited authority and informs the third party of this limitation the principal is not bound by the agents actions that exceed that authorityholding that the agents superficial and cursory questioning of the consenting party did not disclose sufficient information for the agent reasonably to believe that she had common authority over the premises and that further inquiry was required under rodriguez & \n\nwas found to have retained any privacy in the room after his eviction, the degree of privacy retained would not be significant under the totality of the circumstances. Additionally, while a hotel room may differ slightly from an in-home situation, Defendant and Nishimura still had the opportunity to hide weapons in the room just as they would have in a home. Because Nishimura was tasked with packing her belongings, the officers believed it necessary to secure the area from any danger posed to them. The Government argues that in the instant case, it would have been unreasonable for Special Agent Nutter to have left the drawer unsearched and jeopardized the safety of all present should Nishimura have gained access to a loaded gun. See United States v. Flippin, 924 F.2d 163 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Defendant counters that, here, a search for holding that the opening of a makeup bag was justified when a woman had grabbed the bag when the officer turned away had resisted it being taken from her the bag felt heavy her companion had been armed the previous day and the officer and individual were aloneholding the opening and inventory of a shoulder bag was reasonable despite the possible alternative of securing the bag as a wholeholding that when fleeing felon tossed a mesh bag weighing four or five pounds toward the officer the officer would have been justified if he fired at that moment out of fear that the bag might knock his firearm out of his hand but that he was not justified in firing after bag hit him and fell to the ground without injuring him and suspect turned and ranholding that search of shoulder bag was not authorized by search warrant for apartmentholding an officers reasonable suspicion that the suspect was armed was sufficient justification for seizure of suspects makeup bag and exigent circumstances justified the subsequent warrantless search of the closed bag & \n\nplate. 308 Or at 93. But, when the officer approached the defendant\u2019s car, he saw a temporary registration sticker in the window. At that point, the officer\u2019s reason for the stop evaporated. Id. Nevertheless, the officer proceeded to ask the defendant for his driver\u2019s license and proof of registration. The defendant\u2019s responses to those requests led to the discovery of evidence that the defendant\u2019s license was suspended and he was driving uninsured. The Supreme Court held that, once the reason for the stop evaporated, the officer did not have authority to ask the defendant for his license and registration, and the court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order suppressing the evidence resulting from those requests.

As Starr and Farley show, an illegal stop holding that defendants voluntary consent to search his car dissipated taint of officers illegal entryholding that officers request for defendants name during an illegal entry constituted exploitation of the illegal entry under hallrecognizing difference in elements between offense of actual entry and attempted entryholding in an impliedconsent case that a warrantless police entry was unlawful in part because the police did not request entryholding that a confession obtained by exploitation of an illegal arrest is not admissible & \n\nto insure that the defendant will not flee the jurisdiction.

Further, the statutory presumption that pretrial detention is appropriate in Medina\u2019s case does not violate his constitutional rights. The pre sumption, as applied in Medina\u2019s ease, arose following a determination by the magistrate that probable cause existed to believe Medina committed the crimes with which he was charged. Such a probable cause determination may be alone sufficient to justify detention pending trial. See Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 114, 95 S.Ct. 854, 863, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975) (<HOLDING>); Schall v.

See Edwards, 178 F.3d at 241 n. 6. Next, the Joneses dispute the district court\u2019s dismissal of their third claim, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing under the Uniform Commercial Code (\u201cUCC\u201d), as adopted by Virginia, which they based on Defendant\u2019s alleged breaches of contract discussed supra. The Joneses\u2019 claim fails as a matter of law for two reasons. First, the UCC does not apply to transfers of real property. Greenwood Assocs., Inc. v. Crestar Bank, 248 Va. 265, 448 S.E.2d 399, 402 (1994). Second, even if the deed of trust falls under the UCC as the Joneses argue, their claim fails because it was pled as a separate tort claim. See Charles E. Brauer Co. v. NationsBank of Va. N.A., 251 Va. 28, 466 S.E.2d 382, 385 (1996) (<HOLDING>). Finally, the Joneses contend that the holding that where the conduct forming the basis of the plaintiffs breach of duty of good faith and fair dealing claim is the same conduct forming the basis for the breach of contract claim the claims merge and there is no separate cause of action for breach of duty of good faith and fair dealingholding that a cause of action for breach of contract accrues at the time of the breachholding that the failure to act in good faith does not amount to an independent tort the breach of the implied duty under the ucc gives rise only to a cause of action for breach of contractrecognizing that breach of contract cause of action accrues at time of the breachholding that breach of good faith and fair dealing claim requires showing of breach of contract & \n\nfor breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing by Amtrak because it has failed to plead a valid contract. While Virginia law recognizes a contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing, Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Company-Connecticut, 156 F.3d 535, 542 (4th Cir.1998), a breach of that duty only creates a claim for breach of contract. Joyce v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., 845 F.Supp. 353, 355 (E.D.Va.1993) (stating that there is no independent cause of action for breach of implied covenant). Where, as here, there is no allegation of a valid contract betwee ence with prospective business advantage fails because Plaintiff has not alleged the existence of a valid business expectancy. Krantz v. Air Line Pilots Assoc., 245 Va. 202, 205-06, 427 S.E.2d 326 (1993) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiff admits in its Amended Complaint holding that with respect to tortious interference recognized standards of business ethics and business customs and practices are pertinentrecognizing the tort of interference with prospective contractual relations as a subspecies of the broader tort of interference with prospective economic advantageholding that the first element in a prima facie case of tortious interference with prospective business advantage is the existence of business expectancyholding that the first element in a prima facie case of tortious interference with contract is the existence of a valid contractual relationshiprecognizing action for tortious interference with prospective advantage & \n\ndefense of misrepresentation on the policy application is not proper; he had fully cooperated and satisfied all conditions of the i a-contractual claims was improper because: (1) he needed to conduct additional discovery regarding the reasonableness of the denial; and (2) the issue of whether Farmers breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing was a fact issue. In this case, Farmers had a reasonable basis for denying the claim based on Perrotta\u2019s own breach of the policy. See Betco Scaffolds Co., 29 S.W.3d at 348. As such, Farmers did not breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing to Perrotta with regard to that denial, and Perrotta\u2019s extra-contractual claims fail as a matter of law. See United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Williams, 955 S.W.2d 267, 268 (Tex.1997) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we affirm summary judgment for holding title company liable for bad faithholding that bad faith includes lack of good faith in investigating the facts of a complaintholding insurer not liable for bad faith when it denied insureds claim based on a good faith dispute regarding the interpretation of a ruleholding there can be no claim for bad faith when an insurer has promptly denied a claim that is in fact not coveredholding that a bad faith claim is a tort & \n\nhis position as an \u201cex-post facto attempt to add additional terms to the Forbearance Agreement.\u201d Instead, Saverin asserts, he is alleging that Wendy\u2019s bad-faith actions breached the existing terms of the Forbearance Agreement. Specifically, he posits that the very purpose of the Forbearance Agreement was frustrated when Wendy\u2019s failed to prevent the occurrence of a condition \u2014 the appointment of a receiver \u2014 that permitted Wendy\u2019s to prematurely terminate the Forbearance and Franchise Agreements. But this reasoning ignores the principle that the implied duty of good faith cannot be breached by acting as allowed by the specific terms of the contract. Ed Schory & Sons, 662 N.E.2d at 1083; see also Jim White Agency Co. v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., 126 F.3d 832, 834-35 (6th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). Simply put, Saverin admits that Wendy\u2019s did holding that franchisor not only has valid interest in protecting good will it has developed but it also has an interest in being able to place a new franchisee at or near the same location where its goodwill has been createdholding that a common law breach of contract action will lie for the insurers failure to comply with its obligation to act in good faith and with due care in representing the interests of the insured in its failure to settle with a third partyholding that a lending institution does not violate a separate duty of good faith by adhering to its agreements with a borrower or enforcing its contractual rights as a creditorholding that franchisor has an interest in the goodwill its franchise has createdholding in a case decided under ohio law that a franchisor cannot be found liable for failure to act in good faith where it has done no more than to insist on enforcing its contract rights to the detriment of its franchisee & \n\nhowever, that private contractual arrangements are not subject to constitutional requirements of objective standards. Id. 20. In the private sector, standards of reasonableness are commonly applied or implied which take into account the facts and the circumstances. See, e.g., NMSA 1978, \u00a7 55-1-102(3) (1961) (stating that under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u201cparties may by agreement determine the standards by which the performance of such obligations is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable\u201d); Watson Truck & Supply Co. v. Males, 111 N.M. 57, 60, 801 P.2d 639, 642 (1990) (every contract imposes upon parties a duty of good faith and fair dealing in its performance and enforcement); Boss Barbara, Inc. v.

A bad faith action under section 8371 is neither related to nor dependent on the underlying contract claim against the insurer. See March v. Paradise Mutual Insurance Co., 435 Pa.Super. 597, 646 A.2d 1254 (1994) (\u201ca claim brought under section 8371 is a cause of action which is separate and distinct from the underlying contract claim.\u201d). As a result, Miller (and, by extension, appellants) were not required to wait until the merits of the contract claim were decided to file suit for bad faith. See Boring v. Erie Insurance Group, 434 Pa.Super. 40, 641 A.2d 1189 (1984) (<HOLDING>); and Margolies v.

Bredesen, 500 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir. 2007). Moreover, the plaintiffs' \"obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of their entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of the cause of action.\u201d Id. at 527. \"To state a valid claim, a complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory.\u201d Id. 5 . A party may recover damages in equity if there exists a contract implied in law, see Paschall's, 407 S.W.2d at 153; however, equitable relief is not available if there exists a contract implied in fact.

Sony Elecs., Inc., holding that at will contracts of employment are subject to tortious interference with contracts claimsholding that ajctions brought upon theories of unjust enrichment quasi contract contracts implied in law and quantum meruit are essentially the same courts frequently employ the various terminology interchangeably to describe that class of implied obligations where on the basis of justice and equity the law will impose a contractual relationship between parties regardless of their assent theretoholding implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing found in some commercial contracts does not extend to atwill employment contractsholding he who seeks equity must do equity holding only contracts implied in law are creatures of equity & \n\nsee also Johnson v. City of Fort Wayne, 91 F.3d 922, 943 (7th Cir.1996) (noting that a property interest may arise from an express or implied contract, as well as a state statute or regulation). The plaintiffs assert that defendants deprived them of a property interest in an expected degree from an accredited state institution. Illinois courts have not identified clearly a property right in post-secondary education. However, Illinois courts have found that the payment of tuition to an educational institution ordinarily gives rise to an implied contract that the school will award a degree upon the student\u2019s satisfaction of the degree requirements established by the school. See Johnson v. Lincoln Christian Coll., 150 Ill.App.3d 733, 103 Ill.Dec. 842, 501 N.E.2d 1380, 1384 (1986) (<HOLDING>); Wilson v.

Court of Appeals.\u201d). The Supreme Court held in Salve Regina College v. Russell,. 499 U.S. 225, 111 S.Ct. 1217,113 L.Ed.2d 190 (1991), that \u201ca court of appeals should review de novo a district court\u2019s determination of state law.\u201d Id. 499 U.S. at 231, 111 S.Ct. at 1221. The D.C. Court of Appeals has not squarely addressed the question whether bad faith denial of an insurance claim constitutes an independent tort under D.C. law. The district court has considered the issue in two separate reported cases, but these cases are directly in conflict. Compare GEICO, 769 F.Supp. at 387 (\u201cDistrict of Columbia law does not recognize the tort of bad faith denial' of an insurance claim.\u201d) with Washington v. Group Hospitalization, Inc., 585 F.Supp. 517, 520 (D.D.C.1984) (<HOLDING>). We find it unnecessary to divine whether the holding that the district of columbia is among the many jurisdictions that have recognized a cause of action in tort for the bad faith refusal of an insurer to payholding that insured may recover attorneys fees from insurer where insurer acts in bad faithholding that no cause of action for bad faith exists when insurer has reasonable grounds to contest liabilityholding that a bad faith claim is a tortholding that an insurance contract between the parties and a breach thereof by the defendant is an element of a bad faith refusal claim & \n\nrequires Educators to bargain directly with Savage. This statutory provision, together with the structurally inclusive nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, creates a relationship of trust and reliance between injured employees and workers\u2019 compensation insurers. I would hold, as have several other courts, that this relationship places a tort-based duty on insurers to deal in good faith with injured employees. See Savio, 706 P.2d at 1272-74 (nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, combined with section of workers\u2019 compensation statute requiring that insurance policies contain clause making insurer primarily liable to employee, creates tort duty on part of insurer to deal in good faith with employee); see also Case v. Toshiba Am. Info. Sys., Inc., 7 F.3d 771, 773 (8th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>); Hollman v. Liberty Mut. Ins.

Jan. 7, 2013) (\u201cBased on the overwhelming precedent where federal courts sitting in diversity have applied Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(b) rather than state law to decide bifurcation issues\u2014many of which appear in the precise context presented in this case\u2014the Court cannot agree with the parties\u2019 assertions that Kentucky law governs and instead finds Rule 42(b) is the standard applicable here.\u201d). Federal law on bifurcation for bad faith claims against insurers does not support Arrowood\u2019s argument for separate trials. Federal courts sometimes bifurcate trials of underlying liability claims and bad faith claims, but only when the liability claims are still unresolved. See, e.g., Warren v. Federal Ins. Co., 358 Fed.Appx. 670, 676 (6th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). There is no pending contract claim here.

Although in his Original Petition the plaintiff alleges in a conclusory fashion that he was a public employee working pursuant to a contract of employment, the plaintiff fails to allege any facts to indicate that a contract of employment existed and further fails to provide any competent summary judgment evidence to support this allegation. The City of Was-kom\u2019s ordinance provides that the term of office of the municipal judge shall be by appointment of the City Council by a majority vote of the governing body. The City\u2019s ordinance does not appear to create a contract of employment. See Youngblood v. City of Galveston, 920 F.Supp. 10B (S.D.Tex. 1996) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiff does not even allege that the holding that plaintiff did not have dueprocessprotected property interest because he failed to sufficiently plead a rule or other mutually explicit understanding from the manual or otherwise bridling the reason for which he could be terminated and thereby creating a sufficient expectation of continued employment the critical component herewithout alleging such a bridle plaintiff was an atwill employee consequently he lacked a property interest in his continued employmentholding that former municipal judge did not have property interest in continued employmentholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that property interest in continued expectation of public employment does not include right to actually occupy positionholding an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was insufficient to create a property interest in continued employment under montanas statutory scheme for at will employment & \n\nwas reasonable, it believes that plaintiffs have met the Tenth Circuit\u2019s modified interpretation of the \u201clikelihood of success\u201d requirement. The court believes that plaintiffs have successfully shown \u201cquestions going to the merits so serious, substantial, difficult and doubtful, as to make the issues fair ground for litigation and deserving of more deliberate investigation.\u201d See Buca, 18 F.Supp.2d at 1201 (citing City of Chanule, 754 F.2d 310 and Otero Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 665 F.2d 275). Moreover, the court believes that if plaintiffs ultimately prevail on a theory of promissory estoppel, the covenant would be enforceable to the extent that it protects any legitimate business interest beyond mere competition. See Eastern Distrib. Co., Inc. v. Flynn, 222 Kan. 666, 567 P.2d 1371 (1977) (<HOLDING>). The court concludes from the record before it holding that the restraint of a covenant not to compete must be reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case and that only a legitimate business interest may be protected by the covenantholding employment agreement consisting entirely of a covenant not to compete unenforceable because the covenant must be supported by valuable considerationholding that michigan courts would not enforce a covenant not to compete which violates mcla 445761 even though the covenant would have been enforceable in missouri where the contract was executedholding that a covenant not to compete for two years was enforceableholding that in the employment context cause of action seeking tort remedies for breach of implied covenant is not permitted recovery for breach of this covenant is limited to contract remedies & \n\nit fails to pay its employees promptly, see Biggs v.

An employer\u2019s failure to heed administrative rulemaking or precedent with respect to the FLSA deprives the employer of the good faith defense. See, e.g., Joiner v. City of Macon, 814 F.2d 1537, 1539 (11th Cir.1987) (in view of Department of Labor regulation, the City of Macon could not reasonably believe that its mass transit system employees were excluded from FLSA requirements); Richard v.

See, e.g., 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 327(a) (\u201c... the trustee, with the court\u2019s approval, may employ ...\u201d); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(b) (\u201cThe trustee, after notice and a hearing, may use, sell, or lease ... \u201d); and 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365(a) (\u201c... the trustee, subject to the court\u2019s approval, may assume or reject ... \u201d). As a consequence, courts have been left in these many instances to figure out for themselves what they are to consider. Their response, though, has frequently been limited to only the adoption of some vague standard that in turn is exemplified by some equally vague phrase. Take, for example, the different measures that courts have offered in connection with Section 363(b) sales. Section 363(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code governs the present dispute and provides (Bankr.D.Del.1987) (<HOLDING>); In re Charlesbank Laundry Co., 37 B.R. 20, 22 holding that the duty of good faith and fair dealing is a contractual dutyholding that duty of good faith and fair dealing did not extend to thirdparty claimantholding that benefiting fiduciary must show he acted in good faith and that transactions were fair and equitableholding that a sale must be both fair and reasonable in price and made in good faithholding that the transaction must be fair and equitable and in good faith & \n\nless clear but likely that she would have a separate claim for misrepresentation either in equity for restitution or at law for negligent or fraudulent misrepresentation. See ARCO Alaska, Inc. v. Akers, 753 P.2d 1150, 1153 (Alaska 1988); Great Western Sav. Bank v. George W. Easley Co., 778 P.2d 569, 580-81 (Alaska 1989); Turnbull v. LaRose, 702 P.2d 1331, 1334 (Alaska 1985) (non-disclosure). The United States has not consented to be sued for such claims. The issue is whether St. Denis has a tort claim separate from misrepresentation. The applicable law is the law of Alaska because, under Alaska law, the government\u2019s obligations are measured by the obligations of a private party. Bell, 755 F.Supp. at 271-72.

Zimmerman, 175 Kan. 719, 721, 267 P.2d 543, 545 (Kan.1954). As the bankruptcy and district courts noted, however, some courts have adopted a \u201cmodern\u201d view of trespass that recognizes intangible invasions. See, e.g., Public Service Co. of Colo. v. Van Wyk, 27 P.3d 377, 390 (Colo.2001) (\u201c[W]e now hold that, in Colorado, an intangible intrusion may give rise to claim for trespass.... \u201d); Bradley v. Am.

Sidense Corp., 738 F.3d 1302, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2013) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, in MarcTec, we affirmed the holding that future benefits are available upon a finding of bad faith because repudiation is a legal conclusion which the trial court reaches after the fact finder makes its determinations about whether there was a breach and whether the breach was in bad faithholding that the district court should consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether the patentee acted in subjective bad faith and should consider whether circumstantial evidence would support an inference of bad faithholding that evidence of counsels bad faith constituted unusual circumstancesholding the bad faith rationale inapplicable given that the defendants acted in good faith in appealing the case and in raising defenses to the plaintiffs claimsholding that a bad faith claim is a tort & \n\nwaivers, deletions, changes or amendments shall be effective during the life of this Agreement, unless evidenced in writing, dated and signed by the parties hereto.\u201d Agreement \u00a7 16.1.

B. Application of Claim Preclusion to Claim in This Case Under Article I, Section 24 of the Iowa Constitution. We first consider whether the doctrine of claim preclusion applies under the circumstances of this case. Here, the parties are identical, there is no doubt that the article I, section 24 claim could have been brought in the prior proceeding, and there was a final judgment on the merits in the first action. Arnevik, 642 N.W.2d at 319. Further, no additional evidence would have been required to litigate the constitutional question in the first proceeding, in contrast to our other cases allowing parties to litigate separate claims involving the same contract in two proceedings. See Westway Trading Corp. v. River Terminal Corp., 314 N.W.2d 398, 401 (Iowa 1982) (<HOLDING>). Although not raised by the parties, there is holding that prior adjudication barred a claim that arose out of the same transactions and that could have been raised in prior suitholding that claim preclusion did not bar fire insurer from bringing a second action against its coplaintiff in first actionholding district court dismissal of plaintiffs present action did not constitute prior action and thus did not count as third strikeholding claim preclusion did not foreclose plaintiffs second action even though it arose out of the same lease agreement as that of a prior actionholding that a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was preempted where it arose out of the same conduct as a preempted contract claim & \n\n"}

Park Place Entm\u2019t Corp., 322 F.3d 211, 215 (2d Cir.2003). Counterclaim 4 simply recites the elements of a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations . without alleging facts to support this claim. Importantly, it fails to identify the business relationships and third parties to those relationships on which the claim is based. It fails to set forth any facts regarding the \u201cimproper, deceptive, illegal or fraudulent conduct\u201d in which Plaintiff and Counter-Defendants engaged. Such conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim. See Advanced Global Tech. LLC v. Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc., 15 Misc.3d 776, 836 N.Y.S.2d 807, 812 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2007) (<HOLDING>).

While Virginia law recognizes a contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing, Va. Vermiculite, Ltd. v. W.R. Grace & Company-Connecticut, 156 F.3d 535, 542 (4th Cir.1998), a breach of that duty only creates a claim for breach of contract. Joyce v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co., 845 F.Supp. 353, 355 (E.D.Va.1993) (stating that there is no independent cause of action for breach of implied covenant).

The requirements of activity beyond the scope of employment, malice, and personal gain invoked by Cohen are referenced out of context. That heightened standard applies when a corporate officer is accused of tortiously interfering with, or inducing the breach of, a contract between that officer\u2019s employer corporation and a third party. See, e.g., Maillet v. Frontpoint Partners, L.L.C., No. 02 Civ. 7865(GBD), 2003 WL 21355218, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. June 10, 2003) (\u201cUnder ... New York law, officers and directors are only hable for interfering with their own, company\u2019s contracts if they exceed the scope of their authority.\u201d (emphasis added)); The High View Fund, L.P. v.

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

State Farm was justified in informing insureds of this policy limitation and in suggesting alternative vendors whose charge would be fully covered under the policy. See Minn.Stat. \u00a7 72A.201, subd. 4(5) (making it an unfair claims practice to fail to notify an insured of all available benefits which the insured may be eligible to receive); see also DeBonaventura v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 419 A.2d 942, 951 (Del.Ch.1980) (<HOLDING>).

Nor can we say that Aidco\u2019s actions were targeted to have an effect in Iowa. See Calder, 465 U.S. at 789, 104 S.Ct. at 1487. When a business seeks to promote its products and solicit the customers of its competitors, it necessarily wishes to have customers believe that its products are superior and to place its competitor\u2019s products in a less favorable light. Although this promotion and solicitation may have an effect on a competitor, absent additional contacts, this effect alone will not be sufficient to bestow personal jurisdiction. We do not mean to imply that we approve or disapprove of Aidco\u2019s actions, only to point out that the holding of Calder cannot be read as broadly as Hicklin wishes. See also Keystone Publishers Serv., Inc. v. Ross, 747 F.2d 1233, 1234 (8th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>). For the reasons stated above we affirm the recognizing the tort of interference with prospective contractual relations as a subspecies of the broader tort of interference with prospective economic advantageholding that foreseeability of causing injury in forum state is not sufficient for specific personal jurisdictionrecognizing the tort of wrongful interference with anothers business relationsholding that interference with contractual relations occurring outside of iowa and causing injury in iowa is not sufficient to assert personal jurisdiction in iowaholding that the statute of limitations for a claim of tortious interference with contractual relations begins to run when the contract in question has been breached & \n\nhave dismissed tortious interference claims as preempted by ERISA, those cases typically involve a situation in which an entity seeks to utilize the interference claim to duplicate relief available under ERISA. For example, when a participant or assignee argues that,' with respect to a particular claim for payment, the claims administrator (or some affiliate thereof) \u201cinterfered\u201d with payment under the plan by unfairly denying the claim, courts have found that the interference claim is preempted. See, e.g., Adkins v. Unum Provident Corp., 191 F.Supp.2d 956, 959 (M.D.Tenn.2002); Steele v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 499 F.Supp.2d 1035, 1041 (E.D.Tenn.2007); Ctr. for Special Procedures v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., Civil Action No. 09-6566(MLC), 2010 WL 5068164, at *7 (D.N.J. Dec. 6, 2010) (<HOLDING>). Here, the interference claim does not relate holding that insurer could not tortiously interfere with its own insurance planholding only that although a party cannot interfere with its own contract a supervisor who is not an officer of a plaintiffs employer is not a party to the plaintiffs employment contract and therefore can interfere with itholding that state malpractice claims against insurer for negligently failing to obtain replacement insurance plan was not preemptedholding that a corporate officer acting in his or her official capacity could not tortiously interfere with a corporate contract because corporations act only through their officers and agentsholding that insurance certificate holder could not maintain negligence action against insurer when certificate holder was not insurers customer did not discuss insurance coverage with insurer and did not make any specific request to procure insurance coverage & \n\nwhen, under a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the Court might well conclude that Rodrigues had failed to state a claim because he has not alleged that Pacheco had notice of the charge or an opportunity to conciliate. The Court need not resolve this difficult question, however, because it determines below that the plaintiff has stated a colorable state law claim against Pacheco for interference with contractual relations. 2. Interference with Contractual Relations Genlyte argues that the claim against Pacheco for tortious interference with contractual relations is preempted by c. 151B. The weight of authority holds otherwise. While c. 151B\u2019s remedial scheme preempts all other state statutory causes of action, see, e.g., Green v. Wyman-Gordon Co., 422 Mass. 551, 557-558, 664 N.E.2d 808, 813 (1996) (<HOLDING>), an employee is not foreclosed, under holding a pleading will not be sufficient to state a claim under the civil rights act if the allegations are mere conclusionsholding that civil rights claims under 42 usc 1981 and 1982 are personal injury tort claimsholding that c 151b precludes claims under mass gen l c 214 1c civil rights act and equal rights actholding that damages based on the abstract value of constitutional rights are not a permissible element of compensatory damages in action under civil rights act of 1871holding that 16 of the urban mass transit act 1656 of the federalaid highway act and other acts created no substantive rights sufficient to invoke 1983 & \n\n75, 76, 81, 83, 84, 91, 92, 94, 102, 105. The court finds these alleged statements insufficient because they are unaccompanied by facts which demonstrate their accuracy or Defendants\u2019 involvement or control in their preparation. Moreover, as recently determined by one court in this district: \u201ca plaintiff cannot meet the requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) merely by pleading the specific time, place, and contents of misleading statements by a specifically identified analyst. Rather, to hold a defendant liable for misleading statements published by a third party, the plaintiff must at least identify the defendant who provided the information that the third party made public to the market.\u201d Barrie, 2002 WL 1841631, * 3; see also Suna v. Bailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 72-73 (1st Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>).

Further, the accommodation was reasonable. See id. at 595-96. 5 \u201cIn an action for wrongful interference with contract the plaintiff must prove that the plaintiff had a contract with a third party, the defendant knowingly induced the third party to break that contract, the defendant\u2019s interference was improper in motive or means, and the plaintiff was harmed by the interference.\u201d Abramian, 432 Mass at 122. 6 See also Comey v.

These facts supported the jury\u2019s finding of alter ego.

Although the danger of prejudice associated with prior conviction evidence is often great, the district court in this case substantially reduced the possibility of prejudice to Bonner by carefully instructing the jury on how they could consider the evidence.

B. Medina contends that the instruction improperly diminished the State\u2019s burden of proof. When explaining reasonable doubt to the jury, the trial court stated: \u201cwhen we talk about a reasonable doubt we mean doubt from which a reason can be given, a doubt which arises from a fair and rational consideration of the evidence or perhaps the lack of evidence, it means a doubt as would cause a man of ordinary prudence to pause or hesitate when called upon to act in the most important aspects of life.\u201d This portion of the charge was incorrect. It erroneously implies that the jury must find an articulable reason to support its doubts about the State\u2019s case. See State v. Vaszorich, 13 N.J. 99, 115, 98 A.2d 299 (1953) (<HOLDING>).

Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 318 F.2d 364, 369 (3rd Cir.1963). Because there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could find that Jenkins was given a direct order, the district court\u2019s failure to give the proposed instruction was tantamount to reinstating the defense of assumption of risk. The district court\u2019s instruction allowed the jury to treat the employee\u2019s \u201cvoluntary, knowledgeable acceptance of a dangerous condition\u201d as contributory negligence.

As a result, I would affirm the post-conviction courts denial of Carter\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. If deficient performance by appellate counsel is found, we turn to the prejudice prong to determine whether the issues appellate counsel failed to raise would have been clearly more likely to result in reversal or an order for a new trial.

(Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter. See Benefield v. State, 904 N.E.2d 239, 247 n. 4 (Ind.Ct.App.2009) (<HOLDING>), trans. denied.

The Government notes that the Court in Gray suggested \u201c[m]e and a few other guys [beat the victim]\u201d as an alternative to the improper redaction in the phrase \u201c[m]e, deleted, deleted, and a few other guys [beat the victim].\u201d 523 U.S. at 196, 118 S.Ct. 1151. But the language \u201ca few other guys\u201d is less specific than \u201cothers\u201d as stated at trial, especially when coupled with Alexander\u2019s identification of \u201cthe other individuals\u201d as the four other Defendants just a few minutes earlier in Hodous\u2019s testimony. Another issue implicates the Confrontation Clause. The analyses in Richardson, Gray, and Vasilakos assume the presence of a limiting instruction. See, e.g., Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702 (<HOLDING>). Here, no limiting instruction was given to holding that where a defendants name is replaced with a neutral pronoun as long as identification of the defendant is clear or inculpatory only by reference to evidence other than the redacted confession and a limiting instruction is given to the jury there is no bruton violationholding that when all references to the defendant in a eodefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the clause was not violated by a redacted confession with a proper limiting instructionholding that when all references to the defendant in a codefendants statement are replaced with indefinite pronouns or other general terms the confrontation clause is not violated by the redacted statements admission if when viewed together with other evidence the statement does not create an inevitable association with the defendant and a proper limiting instruction is givenholding that the confession did not violate the confrontation clause because it was redacted to eliminate not only the defendants name but any reference to his or her existence & \n\nalso provided that \u201cin order to convict of manslaughter by intentional act, it is not neces sary for [the] State to prove that the defendant had a premeditated intent to cause death.\u201d This instruction did not require the jury to find that Mr. Jasper intended to kill the victim. See Daniels v. State, 72 So.3d 227, 232 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011) (finding 2008 amended instruction not fundamentally erroneous), review granted, 79 So.3d 744 (Fla.2012) ; Moore v. State, 57 So.3d 240, 244 (Fla. 3d DCA 2011) (\u201cBecause the instruction given differs from the instruction given in [State v.]Montgomery [, 39 So.3d 252 (Fla.2010)], and the jury was also instructed on manslaughter by culpable negligence, we find no fundamental error.\u201d); but cf.

Evidence of the replacement cost was admitted, and the jurors were simply instructed that, if they determined the plaintiff was entitled to possession of the property, they were also to \u201cdetermine the value of that property as of the date of trial.\u201d They were not instructed that \u201cvalue\u201d meant market value, not replacement cost. Under these circumstances, we do not believe the jury\u2019s award of replacement cost at a level proposed by the plaintiffs expert was so far outside the range of evidence as to suggest the jury was motivated by passion. See Schmitt, 170 N.W.2d at 660-61 (<HOLDING>). A similar view can be reasonably taken of the holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial courtholding that appellate courts determine the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction based on a review of all of the evidence admitted at trialholding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objectionholding new trial cannot be based on claim of prejudice arising from jurys reliance on evidence admitted without objectionholding any error in admission of evidence cured when same evidence later admitted without objection & \n\ntell the jury to disregard the accomplice\u2019s testimony, See 10 Minnesota Practice, CRIMJIG 3.18, it does require that corroborating evidence \u201caffirm the truth of the accomplice\u2019s testimony and point to the guilt of the defendant in some substantial degree.\u201d Sorg, 275 Minn. at 5, 144 N.W.2d at 786. First, we consider that the requirement for the instruction is based on the fact that the \u201ccredibility of an accomplice in inherently untrustworthy.\u201d Lee, 683 N.W.2d at 316. Chapman agreed to cooperate with officers and do a controlled buy in order to avoid criminal charges and jail. Therefore, it is relevant that Chapman was afforded leniency in exchange for his cooperation because he could have been charged with possession or second-degree manslaughter. See Rodriguez, 2007 WL 1412880, at *2 (<HOLDING>). Second, the prosecutor relied heavily on holding that seconddegree manslaughter was not a crime of violence and thus was not an aggravated felony warranting an aliens removalholding on rehearing that the interests of justice would be better served by remanding for new trial on the offenses of seconddegree murder and voluntary manslaughterholding that the lower court properly charged the jury on voluntary manslaughter where defendant testified he was in fear of the threat of physical assaultholding that erroneous manslaughter instruction that defendant intentionally caused the death of the victim did not constitute fundamental error certifying question if a jury returns a verdict finding a defendant guilty of seconddegree murder in a case where the evidence does not support a theory of culpable negligence does a trial court commit fundamental error by giving a flawed manslaughter by act instruction when it also gives an instruction on manslaughter by culpable negligenceholding that drug user was properly charged with seconddegree manslaughter after he cooked a lethal dose of heroin for the victim & \n\ntorture.\u201d As is evident from the facts recited above, there is more than ample evidence to support such a conclusion. This distinction\u2014finding torture but not depravity of mind\u2014is significant. The vagueness problem of the \u201cheinous, atrocious, and cruel\u201d (\u201cHAC\u201d) instruction is curable with appropriately narrowing language. We have held, of course, that requiring \u201ctorture or depravity of mind\u201d does not solve the vagueness problem. Requiring only torture, however, does. See Maynard v.

Morris argues that by not requiring the court to define the limits of reasonable doubt, Mississippi is in effect trampling upon the requirement that the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Mississippi however has a longstanding policy of relying upon jurors to determine whether their doubt is reasonable, and prohibits any instruction that would presume to define the nature of reasonable doubt.

IS THE VERDICT CONTRARY TO THE OVERWHELMING WEIGHT OF THE EVID 03, 806 (1957) (<HOLDING>). This Court cannot substitute its judgment holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting testimony to only one witness where additional witnesses would have provided the same testimonyholding that a district court was entitled to accept or reject testimony on the basis of the witnesses demeanor and candor or lack thereof and contradictions in the witnesses testimonyholding that strength of testimony is not the result of a calculus of witnessesholding that material for witnesses need not be produced to defendant where the witnesses were not called as government witnesses at trialholding that selfinterested witnesses can be reliable when they provide detailed testimony that is corroborated by other witnesses or facts & \n\nstate habeas court\u2019s findings of fact were objectively unreasonable. We assume arguendo, that the district court concluded, for the six reasons it gave, that they were not objectively reasonable. 6 . See, e.g., Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1038, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984) (reasoning that trial court determinations of credibility and demeanor, which are entitled to \"special deference\u201d on direct review, deserve \"no less\u201d respect in habeas proceedings). 7 ..

Thaler, 432 Fed.Appx. 395, 404 (5th Cir.2011) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Again, Rivas is not precedential but is holding that district courts decision that trial counsels failure to object to crawford material was based on a reasonable trial strategy and did not constitute deficient performance under washingtons first prong was not debatableholding that counsel could have reasonably determined that the trial court would not sustain a rule 403 objection therefore counsels failure to object to this evidence was not deficient performanceholding counsels failure to object to victim impact testimony and evidence was not ineffective assistance of counsel when the trial record was silent as to counsels strategyholding that counsels failure to object or request a limiting instruction for evidence of defendants incarceration was sound trial strategyholding that failure to object to properly admitted evidence was not deficient performance by trial counsel & \n\nAs we explained in Part II, supra, it is the role of the trial court \u2014 not the jury\u2014 to determine whether a statement made by a defendant is voluntary and therefore admissible. See id.; Coates v. State, 534 N.E.2d 1087, 1093 (Ind.1989). Trial counsel was under no obligation to tender an instruction regarding the voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s statements, and the trial court would not have been obligated to present such an instruction to the jury. See Abbott v. State, 535 N.E.2d 1169, 1173 (Ind.1989) (upholding the trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession which specifically instructed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time an alleged admission was made); Gibson v. State, 694 N.E.2d 748, 756 (Ind.Ct.App.1998) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds, 702 N.E.2d 707 holding that trial court did not err in refusing to give charge because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that his requested charge was tailored to the evidenceholding that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the defendants tendered instruction regarding the voluntariness of his confessionholding that trial court did not errholding the determination of the voluntariness of a confession is a determination uninfluenced by the truth or falsity of the confessionholding that the district court did not err in refusing to give the defendants requested instruction concerning his mistaken belief about united states citizenship because the court had given an instruction covering the elements of the crime including the mens rea element & \n\n"}

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations.

Parties should be able to bargain for and execute a release barring all further dispute. This principle necessarily contemplates that parties may disclaim rebanee on representations. And such a disclaimer, where the parties\u2019 intent is clear and specific, should be effective to negate a fraudulent inducement claim. As an example, a disclaimer of reliance may conclusively negate the element of reliance, which is essential to a fraudulent inducement claim.

Rather, it continues to represent the quintessential shotgun pleading as this Court has ruled before, by wholly incorporating all paragraphs of the complaint into the second and final count.

If the Ninth Circuit has held to the contrary, HCMF should take that up in an appeal, not in a motion to amend.

Presently before the Court is a motion by the Defendants to dismiss the class action complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (\u201cFed. R. Civ.P.\u201d) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. I. BACKGROUND The following facts are derived from the complaint and the Letter which is attached to the complaint as exhibit A. See Rothman v. Gregor, 220 F.3d 81, 89 (2d Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). On or about August 19, 2005, the Defendants holding that 1 the complaint is deemed to include any documents incorporated in it by reference and any document upon which it solely relies and which is integral to the complaint and that the court may consider such documents on a motion to dismiss pursuant to fedrcivp 12b6holding that a court in deciding a rule 12b6 motion may consider a document that is incorporated by reference into the complaintholding that for the purpose of deciding a motion to dismiss the complaint includes any written instrument attached to it as an exhibit or any statements or documents incorporated in it by referenceholding that a written statement could not be regarded as an affidavit sufficient in law for any purpose because it was not sworn to by any one or before any officerholding that it was appropriate for the district court to refer to the documents attached to the motion to dismiss since the documents were referred to in the complaint & \n\nconsidered by the jury in its sentencing deliberations, this same evidence was also sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances concerning the commission of rape during the murders. See Berryhill v. State, 249 Ga. 442, 450-451 (11) (291 SE2d 685) (1982) (noting that the jury properly reconsiders all of the evidence from the guilt\/innocence phase in the sentencing phase). This same standard, which concerns the sufficiency of the evidence when reviewed on appeal, applies to Martin\u2019s claim here, which is essentially a claim that the trial court erred by not granting a directed verdict regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance at issue. See Miller v. State, 270 Ga. 741, 742 (1) (512 SE2d 272) (1999) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that the standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as the standard for a motion to dismissholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdict & \n\nforfeiture and to offer him a fair chance to present his claim of entitlement. See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v.

That said, the precedents shed some light on the government\u2019s obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurementholding us mail sufficient to give notice but mail cannot be expected to notify person who is missing or unknownholding rules of civil procedure are appropriate in determining what constitutes proper service by certified mailholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he was given sufficient notice of the administrative forfeiture proceeding through certified mailholding that if service done by certified mail action commenced upon receipt of summons and complaint & \n\ncommenced by filing a complaint with the court.\u201d Fed.

Counterclaim 4 simply recites the elements of a claim for tortious interference with prospective business relations . without alleging facts to support this claim.

It fails to set forth any facts regarding the \u201cimproper, deceptive, illegal or fraudulent conduct\u201d in which Plaintiff and Counter-Defendants engaged. Such conclusory allegations are insufficient to state a claim. See Advanced Global Tech. LLC v. Sirius Satellite Radio, Inc., 15 Misc.3d 776, 836 N.Y.S.2d 807, 812 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.2007) (<HOLDING>).

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

The trial court entered a directed verdict on Ordonez\u2019s negligence per se claims. At the charge conference, Ordonez requested an instruction on the negligence per se issue, which the trial court refused.

As discussed supra, Plaintiffs claim that defendants acts were ultra vires, without authority, and null and void. Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants were acting beyond the scope of their authority as public officials. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the Court finds that the allegations are sufficiently pled to defeat Defendants\u2019 motion at this stage of the litigation. See Collin Cnty. Tex. v. Homeowners Ass\u2019n for Values Essential to Neighborhoods (HAVEN), 654 F.Supp. 943, 949 (N.D.Tex.1987) (<HOLDING>). At this stage of the litigation, based upon holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants actions were ultra vires in character and that they acted outside of their capacities as public officials arguably deprives the defendants of rule 12b6 dismissal based upon an absolute immunity defenseholding that a plaintiffs breach of contract claim failed because he could make no showing that the individual defendants acted in their individual capacities when they signed the contract on behalf of the employer housing authorityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that the public policy considerations supporting public officials immunity required that the immunity be applied to bar contribution actions as well as direct actions & \n\nresulted from a good-faith, but erroneous, interpretation of section 6103. Therefore, the United States can have no liability to Plaintiffs. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7431(b). As to the second issue, I find and conclude that the United States has returned to Plaintiffs all the property seized. Accordingly, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), I now issue the findings of fact and conclusions of law that have informed my decision. I. A. Procedural History This case has a complex procedural history. A brief description of that history will provide a meaningful context for the discussion to come. When this case was assigned to United States District Judge Warren K. Urbom, he granted a motion to dismiss by private individuals named as defendants and dismissed Counts IV and VI. See Filing 22 (<HOLDING>). Among other things, the result of Judge holding that wrongfuldisclosure allegations of count iv did not state a claim against private individuals and further holding that conspiracy allegations of count vi did not state a claimholding that similar allegations were insufficient to state a due process claimholding that because the allegations purportedly suppressed by the government were not material an evidentiary hearing further exploring the allegations themselves and the governments knowledge of the allegations is unnecessaryholding district court dismissal of plaintiffs present action did not constitute prior action and thus did not count as third strikeholding that allegations against nondiverse defendants must be factual not conclusory because conclusory allegations do not state a claim & \n\nCitizens v. Bredesen, 500 F.3d 523, 527 (6th Cir. 2007). Moreover, the plaintiffs' \"obligation to provide the \u2018grounds\u2019 of their entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of the cause of action.\u201d Id. at 527. \"To state a valid claim, a complaint must contain either direct or inferential allegations respecting all the material elements to sustain recovery under some viable legal theory.\u201d Id. 5 . A party may recover damages in equity if there exists a contract implied in law, see Paschall's, 407 S.W.2d at 153; however, equitable relief is not available if there exists a contract implied in fact.

Further, while Plaintiffs allegations might also tend to show that Novar was concerned about safety at Indalex or that it even promulgated safety procedures that Indalex was supposed to implement, such allegations are still insufficient as a matter of law to show that Novar entered upon an active course of conduct to ensure the safety of Indalex\u2019s employees so as to create an independent claim of negligence against Novar. See, e.g., Muniz, 737 F.2d at 148 (<HOLDING>). In summary, Plaintiffs Complaint fails to recognizing a state law tort claim for negligence arising under a duty to provide a safe work environmentholding that njeither mere concern with nor minimal contact about safety matters creates a duty to ensure a safe working environment for the employees of a subsidiary corporationholding that control person liability adequately alleged because as the sole shareholder of the subsidiary the parent corporation had the potential power to influence and direct the activities of its subsidiaryholding that parent corporation could not be held liable for any acts of whollyowned subsidiary although boards of directors of the two corporations overlapped in all other respects corporation had not disregarded subsidiarys corporate separateness had not involved itself directly in management of subsidiary and had not otherwise dominated or controlled subsidiaryholding that there must be evidence that the parent corporation assumed a duty to ensure safety & \n\nNo. 95-0641, 1996 WL 633382, *12 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 1996). Plaintiffs allege that there is no legitimate public purpose to reduce the State contribution rate, a substantial impairment of their contractual rights, or that the same was necessary and reasonable to accomplish said purpose. See Dkt. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 95-99, 124-125. On a motion to dismiss, the Court must accept these allegations as true. Thus, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have pled sufficient facts suggesting that Defendants\u2019 actions were not reasonable and necessary. While Defendants rely upon the economic emergency, a resolution of the issues surrounding Defendants\u2019 fiscal crisis and economic situation will involve questions not appropriately resolved on a motion to dismiss. See Nat'l Educ. Ass\u2019n-Rhode, 890 F.Supp. at 1164 (<HOLDING>). Courts have held that \u201cResolution of ... holding that the defendants motion for discharge was premature and thus properly denied by the trial courtholding that the defendants challenge to the evidence through a pretrial motion to dismiss was premature because such a challenge can only be made after the state has had an opportunity to present its evidence to the trier of factholding that a determination of the reasonableness of the defendants actions based upon the economic crisis involving the retirement system was premature on a motion to dismissholding that the trial court erred by granting the defendants motion to dismissholding that the district court properly denied defendants motion to dismiss based upon a lack of jurisdiction when defendant challenged the interstate commerce element of the hobbs act & \n\ncustomers were common in the industry, and pointed out that plaintiffs had not pleaded specifically how the individual defendants had acted fraudulently by counting such customers in a manner common to the industry. Id. In their amended complaint, plaintiffs have added \u00b6 45(a), in which they allege that although Heartland represented in the press release that soft disconnects were common in the industry, \u201cthe counting of soft disconnects as \u2018active\u2019 subscribers is not, and to so count them was materially misleading.\u201d Am.Compl. \u00b6 45(a). Plaintiffs offer no facts to support their conclusory assertion that it was not customary in the industry to count soft disconnects as active subscribers. This allegation is insufficient as a matter of law to plead scienter. See Lovelace, 78 F.3d at 1020 (<HOLDING>). Nor do they address the other defects that holding that bare allegations about industry custom are inadequate to plead scienterholding that the nonmoving party may not defeat a summary judgment motion by standing on the bare allegations in the pleadingsholding a plaintiff must plead sufficient factual allegations to establish that a plausible contract exists but need not plead every detail of the contractholding that plaintiffs bare allegations of malice do not suffice particularly where such allegations are contradicted by plaintiffs own claims that defendants actions were financially motivatedholding that allegations of motive and opportunity were not enough to create a strong inference of scienter & \n\nof law or unwarranted inferences cast in the form of factual allegations. See Gregory v. Shelby County, 220 F.3d 433, 446 (6th Cir.2000). In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must provide the grounds of the entitlement to relief, which requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action. See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964-65, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). That is,\u201c[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d Id. (internal citation omitted); see also Association of Cleveland Fire Fighters v. City of Cleveland, 502 F.3d 545, 548 (6th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>).

As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v. Woodard, 9 So.3d 112, 118 (La. 2009) holding court unable to rule on issue when the record fails to include copies of the evidence needed to decide issue on appealholding that an issue not raised on appeal is waivedholding issue not raised in the bankruptcy court was waived on appealholding that if the record discloses evidence needed to decide the issue of iac and that issue was raised by assignment of error on appeal it can be decided on appeal in the interest of judicial economyholding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it & \n\ndate. Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim. The Walker court noted that Rule 9 was inapplicable, and held that \u201cit is enough in pleading a conspiracy to merely indicate the parties, general purpose, and approximate date, so that the defendant has notice of what he is charged with.\u201d Id. The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v. Mary Immaculate Queen Center, 188 F.3d 857, 859-60 (7th Cir.1999), which Sanchez cites in support of his specificity argument, because the plaintiff in Ryan \u201cdid not so much as hint at what role he might have played or agreed to play\u201d in the alleged conspiracy. Walker, 288 F.3d at 1007; see also, Hoskins v. Poelstra, 320 F.3d 761, 764 (7th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>). The other cases cited by Sanchez are also holding that more than notice to a defendant is requiredholding that a complaint under section 1983 must contain more than naked improbable unsubstantiated assertions without any specificsholding that a person alleging a conspiracy to violate constitutional rights must do more than simply aver that a conspiracy existedholding that complaint alleging a conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his civil rights cannot survive motion to dismiss based on conclusory allegations of conspiracy which are not supported by references to material factsrecognizing that ryan cannot be read to require that a complaint alleging conspiracy under 1983 contain more than notice of time scope and parties involved & \n\nin first degree assault cases. In its discussion, the court held that first, second, and third degree assault are all general intent crimes, meaning that the actor need only intend the assault, not the injury which results. In State v. Swigart, 233 Neb. 517, 446 N.W.2d 216 (1989), an appeal of the defendant\u2019s first degree assault conviction, the court rejected the defend ant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction because the defendant said he did not intend to cause serious bodily injury. Similarly, Parks claims that he did not intend to hurt the baby or break his leg. The Williams court said that the assault statutes prohibit conduct consisting of acts which cause injury of various seriousness. See, also, State v. Duis, 207 Neb. 851, 301 N.W.2d 587 (1981) (<HOLDING>). The assault statutes, Neb. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 holding that assault with dangerous weapon is general intent crime and that it is only necessary to prove that defendant did act of injuring another with dangerous instrument in intentional mannerholding that separate sentences for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and with intent to rob were barredholding that for purposes of the aggravated assault statute if the instrument used is a firearm as defined by section 7900016 then that instrument is a deadly weapon as a matter of law regardless of whether it is loaded or capable of being fired and holding that for purposes of the aggravated assault statute if the instrument is not a firearm then courts are to apply an objective test and look to the nature and actual use of the instrument and not to the subjective fear of the victim or intent of the perpetrator in determining whether the instrument is a deadly weaponholding that possession of a weapon is not in an of itself a crimeholding that mere possession of a dangerous weapon is insufficient to support a charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon & \n\n"}

In addition to his claim above regarding unsworn and allegedly false testimony, Martin argues that the trial court erred by permitting victim impact testimony that was improper in other ways. Because Martin failed to both raise objections and obtain rulings on them regarding any of the allegedly objectionable statements, he has forfeited his right to appeal under ordinary appellate review standards. See Smith, 287 Ga. at 30 (3) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, we conclude under the \u201cplain holding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that a party may not raise a claim on appeal that was not presented to the trial courtholding that a party must obtain a distinct ruling on an issue in order to raise it on appealholding that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal & \n\nalso claims that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument concerning his prior convictions. According to defendant, the State\u2019s comment was improper in that it called attention to the fact that his prior convictions were of the same crime with which he was charged here. Defendant waived this argument. In order to preserve an error for review, a defendant must both object to the alleged error at trial and renew the objection in his written posttrial motion. People v. Hunter, 331 Ill. App. 3d 1017, 1029 (2002); People v. Bennett, 304 Ill. App. 3d 69, 71 (1999). In this case, defendant failed to preserve this error for review because he did not object to the State\u2019s comment at the time it was made and he abandoned his posttrial motions. See Land, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 256 (<HOLDING>). Defendant claims that any failure to object holding that failure to file a postjudgment motion on alleged error of law relating to ruling on exception to the statute of frauds that was committed for first time in the judgment waives any objection to that ruling and that in the absence of any other formal objection the issue is not preserved for appellate reviewholding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate reviewholding that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court is limited to the grounds raised in the motionholding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the failure to obtain a ruling on a motion for new trial waives the issues raised for appellate review & \n\nit construed the claim. The court will address these arguments in turn, and then will turn to whether there was substantial evidence presented at trial to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The court finds Honeywell\u2019s argument that Sundstrand\u2019s evidence was legally insufficient to support a conclusion of non-infringement to be unpersuasive. Even considering that Shinskey said at one point that, \u201cI believe that claim C and claim D must both apply at the same time,\u201d Tr. 1407-08, this does not render Sundstrand\u2019s entire case legally insufficient. Although Shinskey may have made this statement, it is clear that his opinion as to why the APS 3200 did not literally infringe each element of Claim 4 of the \u2019194 patent did not depend on this statement. But see LNP Eng\u2019g Plastics, 77 F.Supp.2d at 549 (<HOLDING>). Specifically, before making this statement, holding that a patentee was entitled to jmol where the thrust of the defendants noninfringement argument was that it did not infringe the patents at issue because it was practicing the prior artholding that because the appellant did not present to the administrative agency the argument it raised before this court the issue was not preserved and holding that even if preserved the argument failedholding that despite the merits of the argument the appellant raised on appeal the issue was not preserved for judicial review because it was not raised before the administrative agencyholding a prior case was not precedent on an issue when the issue was not contestedholding the prosecutors argument if it was there they can bring it to you was not an improper jury argument & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nin the trial court on the grounds now asserted, defendant is deemed to have waived the objection on appeal. CRE 103; People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965 (Colo.App.1983). Kruse, 819 P.2d at 551 (Van Cise, J., dissenting). We agree with Judge Van Cise. The protection provided by section 16-8-107(1) should not have been addressed by the court of appeals. The general rule is that failure to make a timely and sufficient objection during the trial constitutes a waiver of that ground on appeal. Larkin v. People, 177 Colo. 156, 160, 493 P.2d 1, 3 (1972); People v. Browning, 809 P.2d 1086, 1088 (Colo.App.1990). Kruse waived his objection to the admission of Ortiz\u2019s testimony under section 16-8-107(1) by failing to properly object at trial. People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965, 966-67 (Colo.App.1983) (<HOLDING>). An exception to the general rule exists, holding that defendant must have clearly objected at trial to the matter he is raising on appealholding that appellate court could not consider objection to testimony when defendant objected at trial on different groundsholding that error was preserved when defendant objected to question regarding defendant was under arrest immediately following question about postarrest event sufficient to put trial court on notice of appellants state constitutional grounds for objectionholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewholding that claims based on grounds not objected to at trial cannot be considered on appeal & \n\nfact subject to independent appellate review); Lightbourne v. State, 742 So.2d 238, 247-48 (Fla.1999) (requiring cumulative analysis of Brady material). The second issue is whether the trial court erred in denying relief based on erroneous jury instructions as to the CCP and HAC aggravators. The trial court properly denied relief as to appellant\u2019s claims regarding the CCP and HAC instructions. First, the State\u2019s argument (based on the trial court\u2019s ruling) that appellant failed to preserve the error as to the CCP instruction is supported by the record. On direct appeal, appellant failed to specifically argue that the CCP instruction was unconstitutionally vague, even though he advanced the argument with respect to the HAC instruction. See Jackson v. State, 648 So.2d 85, 90 (Fla.1994) (<HOLDING>); see generally Steinhorst v. State, 412 So.2d holding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewholding factor b is not unconstitutionally vagueholding that an issue was not preserved for appellate review because appellants trial objection does not comport with the issue he raised on appealholding that an issue is preserved for appeal where the issue was sufficiently raised for the court to rule on it holding that issue of unconstitutionally vague instruction relative to aggravating factor was properly preserved for postconviction review where the defendant objected to the vagueness at trial and raised the issue on direct appeal & \n\nruling precluded Bolt from testifying about the work papers. The court did not explicitly make a ruling on Bolt\u2019s testimony concerning the work papers. The court stated it was not prepared to rule on Bolt\u2019s analysis of the work papers at the beginning of the trial. The court also stated it had no problem with QCBT mentioning inconsistencies and inaccuracies in the work papers in its opening statement; The record clearly establishes the court\u2019s ruling on the motion in limine declared that Bolt\u2019s testimony concerning generally accepted CPA auditing standards, whether Kireher breached those standards, and causation, was inadmissible. The court did not equivocate or state it would reconsider its ruling at trial. Cf. Holst v. Countryside Enters., Inc., 14 F.3d 1319, 1323 (8th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). Thus, as to this testimony, we conclude the holding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a trial courts evidentiary ruling on a pretrial motion is not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal unless a defendant renews the objection during trialholding that a party failed to preserve error by not pursuing a ruling at trial where the courts motion in limine ruling invited the party to attempt to admit the evidence during trialholding that a party had failed to preserve an argument for appellate review when that party had failed to argue the issue to the trial court either at trial or in his postjudgment motionholding that trial courts have discretion to decide whether litigation conduct violates a ruling on a motion in limine & \n\nthis court held that Rule 11(e)(2) \u201cdirects counsel to provide this court with all evidence relevant to the issues raised on appeal.\u201d Id. at 1002. When the appellant does not do so, we \u201cpresume the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by competent and sufficient evidence.\u201d Id.; see also Call v. City of West Jordan, 788 P.2d 1049, 1053 (Utah 1990); State v. Linden, 761 P.2d 1386, 1388 (Utah 1988). In this case, defendant failed to provide this court with a transcript of the March 8 entrapment hearing, which it was his responsibility to do. See Utah R.App.P. 11(e)(2). \u201cTherefore, our review is strictly limited to whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusions of law and judgment.\u201d Sampson, 770 P.2d at 1002; accord State v. Garza, 820 P.2d 937, 938-39 (Utah App.1991) (<HOLDING>). Section 76-2-303 of the Utah Code sets forth holding that as a general rule this court will not consider an issue that was not raised belowrecognizing general rule that an appellate court cannot address claims that were not raised belowholding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review a legal claim not presented in administrative proceedings belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding court cannot consider proceedings below without adequate record & \n\nchallenge a vehicle search from passenger standing to seek suppression of evidence discovered in a vehicle as the fruit of an unlawful stop, detention, or arrest.\u201d). Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Because there is no evidence in this case holding that plain error review is appropriate unless there is some evidence that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of a particular argumentholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa. R.A.P. 302(a), \u201c[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Edmondson, 553 Pa. 160, 718 A.2d 751, 753 (1998); Commonwealth v. Dennis, 548 Pa. 116, 695 A.2d 409, 411 (1997) (\u201c[I]f appellate courts were to consider issues not raised in the trial court, then the trial would become a dress rehearsal ....\u201d) (citing Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Company, 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114, 116 (1974)); Commonwealth v. Jones, 248 Pa.Super. 214, 375 A.2d 63, 65-66 (1977) (<HOLDING>). Because appellant did not preserve the issue holding that the failure to object to a trial courts instruction constitutes waiverholding that plaintiffs failure to object to the improper comments of defendant during closing arguments resulted in waiver of plaintiffs right to argue the issue on appeal because the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issueholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that failure to object to trial courts refusal of further instruction to jury during deliberation results in waiver of issue on appealholding failure to object in timely fashion at trial results in waiver of issue for appeal & \n\nthe warrant. Rather, according to the trial court, the express terms of the warrant \"through inadvertence\u201d did not permit as extensive a search as was actually conducted. Thus, it appears the actual basis for the trial court's ruling was that the search exceeded the scope of a valid warrant. 3 . We do not here address the question of whether an appellee may raise an argument in defense of the lower court\u2019s judgment when that argument was not presented in the lower court. We do note, however, that our previous opinions on that question have been somewhat inconsistent. See, e.g., Buehner Block Co. v. UWC Assocs., 752 P.2d 892, 894-95 (Utah 1988) (applying argument raised for first time on appeal to affirm lower court\u2019s decision); American Coal Co. v. Sandstrom, 689 P.2d 1, 4 (Utah 1984) (<HOLDING>); L & M Corp. v. Loader, 688 P.2d 448, 449-50 holding that 1252d1 bars the consideration of bases for relief that were not raised below and of general issues that were not raised below but not of specific subsidiary legal arguments or arguments by extension that were not made belowholding that arguments not raised below are waived for appealholding that petitioners had abandoned arguments not raised belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding that an issue not properly preserved below in the district court is generally waived & \n\nas displaying a total lack of competence in the law.\u201d Aplt. Opening Br. at 7. Further, in addition to charging that the judge has violated federal law \u201chundreds of times,\u201d thus demonstrating his \u201cheinous criminal nature,\u201d plaintiffs state: \u201cOf course, it don\u2019t make no never mind to [the district judge, he] is so far above the law, [he] cain\u2019t [sic] see the law, but then, [the judge] makes it up as he goes along anyway.\u201d Aplt. Reply Br. to Aplee. Smith at 3. Referring to one of the defendants\u2019 attorneys, plaintiffs wrote: \u201cbut hey\u2014 when you get to he like hell to gain advantage as [the attorney] has done \u2014 well go ahead and lie! Who cares?\u201d Id. at 4. These statements come perilously close to forfeiting plaintiffs\u2019 right to appellate review. See Garrett, 425 F.3d at 840 (10th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, we have carefully reviewed the holding plaintiffs scurrilous briefs that failed to address substance of claims forfeited appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that when an application letter included a statement referring to the appellate division briefs the claims in the briefs were fairly presented to highest state court because the fair import of this statement was that petitioner was requesting the new york court of appeals to review the same claims that were advanced in the appellate divisionholding that an appellant abandons an issue for purposes of appeal where he fails to argue it in his briefsholding that a habeas petitioner abandons the claims he does not address on appeal & \n\nJJ., concur. 1 . On appeal, Amquip argues the trial court also erred in denying: its motion for summary judgment, the admission into evidence of depositions, and its motion for a continuance. 2 . Amquip contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its request to admit deposition transcripts into evidence and in denying its motion for continuance when it was unable to get the deposition transcripts into evidence. As mentioned previously, those issues are moot because this case is reversed on the denial of the right to a trial by jury. 3 . Although Vercon contends Amquip waived its right to a jury trial by participating in a nonjury trial, this argument relates to whether Amquip preserved the issue for appeal. See Crespo v. Crespo, 28 So.3d 125, 128 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) holding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a claim was not preserved for review where the defense failed to object on the specific grounds advanced on appealholding that the defendant waived the issue on appeal when he failed to contemporaneously object to the admission of such evidence at trialholding exwifes claim regarding admission of parol evidence was not preserved for appeal because she failed to object to the evidence or to having an evidentiary hearing & \n\nby a plausible basis in the record. Secretary\u2019s Br. at 7-8. Furthermore, the Secretary argues that a remand for readjudication in light of the enactment of the VCAA is not required because \u201cthe record fails to reveal the necessity for additional development ... [and the a]ppellant has been given adequate notice which detailed the law and evidence necessary to establish his claim.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Br. at 10. In his reply, the appellant argues that the BVA decision should be vacated and the matters remanded because of \u201cthe Board\u2019s failure to make a finding on the question of whether the VCAA applies.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply at 1. Initially, the Court notes that it will address only those arguments adequately raised by the appellant in his briefs. See Ford v. Gober, 10 Vet.App. 531, 535-36 (1997) (<HOLDING>); Grivois v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 136, 138 (1994); holding that the court has discretion not to consider an issue abandoned on appealholding that an issue not presented to the trial court will not be considered on appealholding that claims presented to bva and not pursued on appeal are considered abandonedholding that issues not argued on appeal are deemed abandonedholding that a deposition that was not presented to the trial court could not be considered on appeal & \n\n496, 745 P.2d 717, 721 (Ct.App. 1987). In this case, Plaintiff filed a pretrial motion to exclude the assailant from being considered a concurrent tortfeasor. The motion cited Lujan v. Healthsouth Rehabilitation Gorp., 120 N.M. 422, 902 P.2d 1025 (1995), the same authority Plaintiff relies on in this appeal. Plaintiff thus fairly invoked a ruling of the trial court on this issue and preserved it for appeal. See id. (explaining liabilities of concurrent and successive tortfeasors). {36} We are unpersuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to preserve this issue by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on comparative negligence. In so contending, Defendants rely on Pittard v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 101 N.M. 723, 729, 688 P.2d 333, 339 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>), and Romero v. Mervyn\u2019s, 109 N.M. 249, 253 n. holding that a party waived an allegation that an instruction was erroneous where the party failed to object at trial to the instruction on those groundsholding that party waived an objection to choice of lawholding defendant waived complaintholding that party waived public policy challenge by failing to raise it during arbitrationholding that party waived complaint regarding instruction where it did not raise specific objection & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>). DOR provided arguments on the applicability recognizing that an appeal has never been an evidentiary proceeding so appellate court will not consider evidence not presented to the lower tribunal because function of appellate court is to determine whether lower tribunal committed error based upon the issues and evidence before itholding on appeal the judgment of the lower court is presumed to be correct and the burden is on the appellant to present to us a sufficient record from which we can determine whether the lower court has erred in the respect complained ofholding the government waived its argument on appeal that the defendant did not have standing to challenge a search when it failed to raise the argument to the district courtrecognizing that the preservation requirement applies even to issues of due process when there has been a clear opportunity to present the argument on appeal to the lower tribunalholding that the general rule that issues not raised in the lower court may not be addressed on appeal applies only to appellants & \n\nbankruptcy court record, including the consolidated pre-trial order, the McFarlands\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and their post-trial, brief, shows that the McFarlands did not present the constructive trust arguments they raise on appeal to the bankruptcy court for resolution. (See Bankr. Dkt. Entries 43, 53, & 76). Nor did they make these arguments in their brief on appeal to. the district court. (See Dist. Dkt. Entry 6). Rather, they asserted throughout the underlying proceedings only that a resulting trust was established. Therefore, the McFarlands cannot now complain that the bankruptcy court failed to address whether a constructive trust was established, and we decline to consider these arguments for the first time on appeal. See In re Egidi, 571 F.3d at 1163 (<HOLDING>). In any case, the McFarlands\u2019 arguments do not holding that an argument not raised before the bankruptcy court will not be considered for the first time on appealholding that court will not consider issue raised for first time on appealholding that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this courtholding that an argument raised for the first time in response to defendants motion to dismiss instead of in an amended complaint was not properly raised before the district court and would not be considered on appealholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered & \n\nthey present no argument that we have not already addressed. 41 . The class-certification order\u2019s certification of the rule 42(b)(1)(A) class also mandates notice and sets forth opt-out provisions, 42 . To the extent LSRC\u2019s fifth issue contains other one-sentence complaints that we have not addressed elsewhere, these- complaints are waived. See Tex. R.

(<HOLDING>), abrogated on other grounds by Kinsel v. holding party failing to adequately brief complaint waived issue on appealholding that appellant waived issue by failing to raise it in opening briefholding that where a party does not adequately brief an argument we need not address it on appealholding that defendant waived his blakely claim as issue on appeal by failing to raise it in his initial briefholding that party waived argument by failing to brief it on appeal & \n\nSecond, \"[o}rderly procedure ... requires that a party must present his entire case and his theory ... of recovery to the trial court.\" Dansie v. City of Herriman, 2006 UT 23, \u00b6 30, 134 P.3d 1139 (first and second alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The policy of judicial economy is most directly frustrated when an appellant asserts unpreserved claims that require factual predicates. For this reason, the preservation rule should be more strictly applied when the asserted new issue or theory \"depends on controverted factual questions whose relevance thereto was not made to appear at trial.\" James v. Preston, 746 P.2d 799, 801 (Utah Ct.App.1987) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Turtle Mgmt., Inc. v. Haggis Mgmt., Inc., 645 P.2d 667, 672 (Utah 1982) (<HOLDING>). {16 The second consideration underlying the holding that an issue was not properly before the court on appeal because the trial court did not have the opportunity to make any findings of fact regarding itholding the findings of fact required to support an alimony award are sufficient if findings of fact have been made on the ultimate facts at issue in the case and the findings of fact show the trial court properly applied the law in the caseholding that a letter utilized by the appellant in his argument would not be considered on appeal because it was not properly before the trial courtholding that trial court made sufficient findings of fact when it dismissed appealholding that it is not an appellate courts function to make findings of fact & \n\nfailing to obtain a final ruling on the right to consul issue. We agree. In State v. Riker, 123 Wn.2d 351, 369, 869 P.2d 43 (1994), the Court held that a defendant who does not seek a final ruling on a motion in limine after a court issues a tentative ruling waives any objection to the exclusion of the evidence. Similarly, in State v. Koloske, the Court noted that \u201c[w]hen the trial court refuses to rule, or makes only a tentative ruling subject to evidence developed at trial, the parties are under a duty to raise the issue at the appropriate time with proper objections at trial.\u201d 100 Wn.2d 889, 896, 676 P.2d 456 (1984), overruled on other grounds by State v. Brown, 111 Wn.2d 124, 761 P.2d 588 (1988). Cf. Breard v. Greene, 523 U.S. 371, 375-76, 118 S. Ct. 1352, 140 L. Ed. 2d 529 (1998) (<HOLDING>).

The court finds summary judgment is appropriate as to Gretillat\u2019s alleged inabilities to squat, crawl, crouch and kneel. Summary judgment as to Gretillat\u2019s alleged inabilities to squat, crawl, crouch and kneel is appropriate because an employer is not required to make an accommodation for the physical limitation of an employee unless the employer has knowledge that such a limitation exists. See, e.g., Miller v. Nat\u2019l Cas. Co., 61 F.3d 627, 629-30 (8th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>).

In order to fall under the protections of the Rehabilitation Act, a claimant must have a disability. The term \"disability,\" as used in the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, means \"(A) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the major life activities of such individual; (B) a record of such an impairment; or (C) being regarded as having such impairment.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2).

We begin by recognizing that a request for reassignment may constitute protected activity under the ADA. We have treated requests for reasonable accommodation as protected activity under the ADA. See Selenke v. Med. Imaging of Colo., 248 F.3d 1249, 1265 (10th Cir.2001); Butler v. City of Prairie Vill., 172 F.3d 736, 752 (10th Cir.1999). And a request for reassignment to a vacant position is a request for a reasonable accommodation. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(9)(B); see also Smith v. Midland Brake, Inc., 180 F.3d 1154, 1167 (10th Cir.1999) (en banc) (<HOLDING>). Hence, if Mr. Jones had a reasonable, good holding that when an employer takes steps to accommodate an employees restrictions it is not thereby conceding that the employee is disabled under the ada or that it regards the employee as disabledholding that employers must when appropriate accommodate a disabled employee by reassignment to a vacant position if employee cannot be accommodated in existing jobholding that an employer does not necessarily regard an employee as disabled simply by finding the employee to be incapable of satisfying the singular demands of a particular jobholding that the employers willingness to accommodate the employee undercut the employees claim of constructive dischargeholding that an employee whose disability is related to his ability to perform the duties of his position is not disabled under the act and therefore an employer has no duty to accommodate & \n\nto start such a process could also subject the Company to liability, especially where WWL seems to have been seeking to determine whether its obligations to Marks included not only an approval of a technician\u2014as he had requested\u2014but also a covering of the cost of such repairs. Under such a rule, moreover, an employer would apparently be able to avoid liability only by immediately approving every disability-accommodation request that it received, even where there was no reason to believe harm might follow from a brief delay. Defendant, moreover, had no reason to believe that Marks would suffer any imminent harm from a brief negotiation period over the scope of his needed accommodations. Accord Ungerleider v. Fleet Mortg. Grp. of Fleet Bank, 329 F.Supp.2d 343, 355 (D. Conn. 2004) (<HOLDING>). This was similarly not a situation where a holding that the disabled individual bears the initial burden of proposing an accommodation and showing that that accommodation is objectively reasonable and that the defendant was entitled to prevail because the plaintiffs proposed accommodation of remaining on unpaid medical leave until another customer service or receptionist position opened up was not a reasonable accommodation under the adaholding that a person must request a reasonable accommodation before he has been terminated he cannot wait until he is terminated and then months later request reinstatement and demand a reasonable accommodationholding that teachers request for four months leave was not a reasonable accommodationholding failure to immediately approve request for accommodation even for employee with known disability did not constitute denial of reasonable accommodation where employer was working on solution over several monthsholding that an employer is not liable where it takes reasonable steps to provide an accommodation and the employee is responsible for a breakdown in the process of identifying a reasonable accommodation & \n\nthe office during normal business hours.

But these excuses do not make Monson\u2019s own conduct any less willful or malicious. The collapse of the business did not relieve Monson of the contractual obligations which he entered into or give him carte blanche to make off with equipment he bought with someone else\u2019s money. Demonstrably, Monson knew his actions were wrongful and without just cause. Further, Monson\u2019s behavior falls outside of the sort of reckless or unfortunate but non-malicious acts that this Court have previously held do not rise to the standard of a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6). See In re Walker, 48 F.3d 1161, 1163-65 (11th Cir. 1995) (<HOLDING>); Ikner, 883 F.2d at 987-91 (affirming the holding that there must be proof of both a willful act and malicious injury to establish nondischargeability under section 523a6holding that the debtors knowing act of failing to obtain workers compensation insurance so that the employer owed an employee a debt after the employee suffered a workplace injury was not the sort of willful and malicious injury required for nondischargeability under 523a6 because it cannot not be said that the employer intended for the employee to suffer a fall or that there was an unbroken chain of events leading from the employers intentional act to the employees physical injuryholding that an injury is not within the scope of employment after the employee has left work unless the injury was caused by the employers negligenceholding that an employer who commits an intentional tort against his employee cannot claim that the act was accidental so that workers compensation is the employees exclusive remedyholding that when an employee suffers an injury from an unexplained fall while the employee is on the job and performing the duties of his employment that injury is eligible for compensation under the workers compensation act & \n\nThus, the question for a jury would be whether the State provided reasonable accommodations resulting in meaningful access for Ms. Jar-amillo, or denied her such access solely on the basis of her disability. For the same reasons discussed above with respect to Ms. Jaramillo\u2019s equal protection claim, the Court concludes that no reasonable jury could find that the accommodations provided by the State were unreasonable. Ms. Jaramillo had been quite successful in the past with identical accommodations, and several courts have made clear that the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act require only reasonable accommodations, not necessarily the particular accommodations an individual would prefer. See, e.g., Camarillo v. Carrots Corp., 518 F.3d 153, 157 (2d Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>); Wernick v. Fed. Reserve Bank of N.Y., 91 F.3d holding that insurance policy that discriminated against the disabled did not violate the ada but did independently violate the unruh actholding that when an employer takes steps to accommodate an employees restrictions it is not thereby conceding that the employee is disabled under the ada or that it regards the employee as disabledholding that the ada does not require an employer to hire an assistant to help a disabled employee fulfill his work responsibilitiesholding that the ada requires fastfood restaurants to implement policies or procedures to effectively train their employees how to deal with disabled individuals but does not require a particular policy or procedureholding that an entity that serves the disabled lacks standing under the ada & \n\nafter learning that leave was needed for a serious health condition. In determining whether an employee provided sufficient notice to his employer, the Sixth Circuit has held that the \u201ccritical question is whether the information imparted to the employer is sufficient to reasonably apprise it of the employee\u2019s request to take time off for a serious health condition.\u201d Brohm v. JH Properties, Inc., 149 F.3d 517, 523 (6th Cir.1998). Courts have held that an employee merely notifying his employer that he is sick, without more, is not sufficient notice to invoke the FMLA. Rather, the employee must notify the employer that he is suffering from a serious health condition that prevents him from performing his normal job. Hammon v. DHL Airways, Inc., 165 F.3d 441, 451 (6th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) Although \u201c[t]he employee need not assert his holding an employee is an agent of his employer where the employer assumes the right to control time manner and method of workholding that an employee requesting unforeseeable medical leave is not required to even mention the fmla when requesting leave for a serious health conditionholding that the employee must at least provide his employer with enough information for the employer to be put on notice that the fmla is a considerationholding that an employee gives his employer sufficient notice that he is requesting leave for an fmlaqualifying condition when he gives the employer enough information for the employer to reasonably conclude that an event described in 29 usc 2612a1 has occurredholding that an employer may deny restoration when it can show that it would have discharged the employee in any event regardless of the leave & \n\nfor an alleged work-related injury through a Board-approved settlement. See OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15. The interplay of OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 34-9-11 (a) and 34-9-15 (b), which this Court has not previously addressed, is informed by how we and the Court of Appeals have interpreted the interplay between the exclusive remedy provision and subsection (a) of OCGA\u00a7 34-9-15. (b) It is well established that a settlement under OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15 (a) which requires an employer to compensate its employee for an alleged injury bars a subsequent tort suit by the employee against anyone protected by the exclusive remedy provision, regardless of the actual circumstances of the employee\u2019s injury and the amount of compensation to which the parties agreed. See Haygood v. Home Transp. Co., 244 Ga. 165, 166-167 (259 SE2d 429) (1979) (<HOLDING>); Thorn v. Phillips, 164 Ga.

The reasoning of several of our sister circuits is consistent with our endorsement of the plain language of the EEOC regulations. See Grenier v. Cyanamid Plastics, Inc., 70 F.3d 667, 676 (1st Cir.1995) (finding that if the plaintiff were \u201ctreated as an existing employee returning from disability leave, ... the employer would be able to demand medical certification of ability to return to work\u201d); Hogan v. Bangor and Aroostook R.R. Co., 61 F.3d 1034, 1036 (1st Cir.1995) (concluding that an employee was entitled to reinstatement after suffering collapsed lung as soon as medical evidence indicated he was fit to return); Pesterfield v. Tennessee Valley Auth., 941 F.2d 437, 438 (6th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). We concur in the reasoning of these circuits. holding that an employee who was hospitalized for psychiatric treatment was required to provide medical certification as to ability to return to workholding that a tortfeasor is required to pay the expenses of over treatment or unnecessary medical treatment unless such treatment was incurred by the victim in bad faith holding that res judicata properly barred claims based on an employers decision to terminate an employee because the termination was not a fresh act of discrimination rather it was the same decision not to allow the employee to return to work that the employee had challenged previouslyholding that an employer need not accommodate with indefinite leave an employee who is unable to return to work in any roleholding that a state is required to provide medical care to incarcerated individuals & \n\nhave a number of tools at their disposal in exercising their Section 8(c) rights to express their views on union organizing efforts. An employer is permitted, for example, to express its views about union representation to masses of employees, in mandatory meetings, on company time, so long as such speech does not occur within 24 hours of an election. See Peerless Plywood Co., 107 NLRB 427, 429 (1953); Livingston Shirt Corp., 107 NLRB 400, 409 (1953). Employers may dispatch supervisors to engage in one-on-one discussions during work time with employees about the negative effects of union representation, see, e.g., NLRB v. Lenkurt Elec. Co., 438 F.2d 1102, 1107-08 (9th Cir.1971), and may disseminate written anti-union materials, Beverly Enterprises-Hawaii, Inc., 326 NLRB 335, 336 (1998) (<HOLDING>). Our opinions have faithfully reiterated our holding that an employees private arbitration agreement with her employer precluded her from filing suit against the employer under the adeaholding that employees failure to comply with employers rule requiring employees to notify employer when a temporary job placement ended did not constitute gross misconduct because the violation was an isolated incident and employer did not try to show that its staffing ability had suffered serious or indeed any consequences as a result of employees unavailabilityholding that the employer did not engage in objectionable conduct when its supervisors handed out flyers even at a time when the employer was enforcing its otherwise valid nodistribution rule against employeesholding that the employer had not demonstrated the employee was discharged for gross misconduct because the conduct was an isolated incident and the employer did not try to show that its staffing ability had suffered serious or indeed any consequences as a result of the employees conductholding unconscionable an arbitration agreement requiring employees to arbitrate claims against the employer but not requiring the employer to arbitrate claims against the employees & \n\nto a broad class or range of jobs. Indeed, she believes that she can perform the dealer job, despite her disabilities, as evidenced by her attempt to obtain employment as a dealer following her termination. She just cannot perform the job at nighttime (or apparently between the hours of 4 a.m. and noon). Such a schedule-specific job restriction is not sufficient to qualify as a substantial impairment on her ability to work. See Cotter v. Ajilon Services, Inc., 287 F.3d 593, 598 (6th Cir. 2002) (rejecting argument that doctor\u2019s order that the plaintiff needed to take frequent breaks to avoid stress and to avoid prolonged overtime demonstrated a substantial impairment of the plaintiffs ability to work); see also Kocsis v.

Here, the bankruptcy court found that the bonus constituted earnings from personal services of Mr. Markosian under \u00a7 1115(a)(2) and that ruling was not appealed. Thus, the earnings fall within the earnings exception stated in \u00a7 541(a)(6).

Chandler, 805 F.2d 555 (5th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>), Hall v. Hall, 51 B.R. 1002 (S.D.Ga.1985) holding former wifes cause of action accrued at the time of former husbands failure to pay her the portion of his retirement benefits to which she was entitled which was no earlier than the date of his actual retirementholding that wife had standing to seek disinterment where death of husband occurred prior to entry of decree of divorceholding that a wife obtained a vested interest in her portion of the retirement benefits as of the date of the divorce decree and any act of the military spouse that unilaterally decreases the nonmilitary spouses vested interest is an impermissible modification of a division of marital property and a violation of the final decree of divorcerecognizing that a divorce decree which obligated the divorcing husband to name the children of his first marriage as the irrevocable beneficiaries of an insurance policy precluded him from naming his new wife as a beneficiary entitled to a portion of the insurance benefitsholding debtor could not discharge that portion of his monthly army retirement benefits awarded to his wife pursuant to a divorce decree & \n\nto reward appellant for his past commendable service, while at the same time, adding incentive for appellant to remain with the company in order to exercise such options. Yet, in the unfortunate circumstance of appellant\u2019s death, the option period would have remained open to appellant\u2019s estate for one year. Similarly, if appellant became disabled, such options would then vest. Notwithstanding the lack of value, such options that were gained prior to the filing of the dissolution petition do represent assets that were accumulated during the marriage and are, thhs, subject to equitable distribution. We also find support for our holding in the majority of other state courts that have addressed this issue. In Fisher v. Fisher, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, reversing both .Ct.App.1987) (<HOLDING>); Pascale v. Pascale, 140 N.J. 583, 660 A.2d holding that the trial court properly determined that unvested stock options have marital aspectholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allocating the husbands unvested stock options as marital propertyholding that unexercised stock options were not marital propertyholding that unvested stock options are a form of compensation and constituted marital property that could be distributed through use of a constructive trustholding that unvested stock options subject to the contingency of debtors future employment are property of the bankruptcy estate & \n\nsubject to court approval are binding before court approval. See In re Frye, 216 B.R. 166, 173-74 (Bankr. E.D.Va.1997). The Frye court explained that those courts that view such agreements as binding reason that contract formation and court approval require different analyses (the court adopted that view). Id. at 173; see also In re United Shipping Co., 1989 WL 12728, at *5 (Bankr.D.Minn. Feb.17, 1989) (\u201cThe considerations a court looks at in approving a settlement are entirely different than whether or not there was an agreement at all.\u201d). On the other hand, other courts look to the Code and reason that if \u201cjudicial approval [is] necessary to go forward, an agreement could not be binding absent the required approval.\u201d Id.; see also In re Sparks, 190 B.R. 842, 843 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.1996) (<HOLDING>). But this split only addresses the parties\u2019 holding that the bankruptcy court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over counterclaims asserted by the bankruptcy estate against a creditor where the claim is a state law action independent of the federal bankruptcy law and not necessarily resolvable by a ruling on the creditors proof of claim in the bankruptcy emphasis addedholding that the creditor did not satisfy the foregoing requirement because it was trying to exercise the avoidance power for itself as a sole creditor not for the benefit of the debtors estate or the creditors as a wholeholding creditors lacked standing to file an adversary action asserting the interests of the estate in seeking to prevent a former principal of the debtor from interfering with the chapter 11 reorganization given the lack of showing of the debtors consent and any determination by the bankruptcy court that the suit would be beneficial to the estate and necessary to a fair and efficient resolution of the bankruptcy proceedingsrecognizing that a court may reverse the pelrbs actions where those actions are arbitrary capricious or an abuse of discretion not supported by substantial evidence on the record taken as a whole or otherwise not in accordance with lawholding that contracts are not binding before court approval because the debtorinpossession operates as a fiduciary any actions taken by the debtor are to be in the best interests of the creditor body as a whole for that reason the debtors actions are subject to review by the creditors of the estate and the bankruptcy court & \n\ndid have a prepetition legal interest in that case. At the time of bankruptcy, \u00a7 172 of the Internal Revenue Code gave the debtor a claim for a tax refund if certain conditions were met. It was the combination of the law and the conditions made legally relevant by the law that conferred on the debtor a prepetition legal interest: the claim for a refund. In that way, the Segal debtors\u2019 claim for a refund is similar to the prepetition accrual of a cause of action that results in a post-petition judgment in the debtor\u2019s favor. In such eases, the debtor\u2019s cause of action is a prepetition legal interest \u2014 \u25a0\u00a7 541(a)(1) property- \u2014 -that brings the postpetition judgment into the estate as proceeds under \u00a7 541(a)(6). See, e.g., Wieburg v. GTE Southwest Inc., 272 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Here, by contrast, Burgess suffered the crop holding that claims harming the debtor corporation that arose from prepetition conduct become property of the estate under 11 usc 541a1holding that causes of action for age and sex discrimination that arose prepetition were property of the bankruptcy estateholding that to make out the fourth element of a prima facie case of sex discrimination plaintiff must prove that males remained in similar positions and similarly for age discrimination that she was otherwise discharged because of her ageholding lost future wages recovered pursuant to a prepetition cause of action are property of the estateholding age discrimination claim barred & \n\nbut seeks a review and reversal of the bankruptcy court\u2019s summary judgment. But see In re Rodriquez, 258 F.3d at 759 (finding the appeal moot because the appellant was challenging the sale of property from the bankruptcy estate where there was no stay pending appeal); Wintz, 219 F.3d at 812 (finding the appeal moot because the appellants failed to obtain a stay pending appeal and thus were barred from attempting to overturn the sale of the property from the bankruptcy estate). In the final analysis, though, this panel cannot provide relief. If we were to rule in favor of Appellant on the summary judgment issue, Appellant could perhaps seek money damages from the proceeds of the sale received by the bankruptcy estate. See In re Popkin & Stem, 223 F.3d 764, 766 n. 2 (8th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). However, obtaining money damages equal to the holding that exhaustion is required under the plra even if the plaintiff seeks only money damages and money damages are not available as reliefholding that the loss of trade secrets cannot be measured in money damagesholding that even if the sale cannot be undone nor property specifically awarded parties may still receive money damages for their lossholding that attorneys fees may be awarded against a public official even when the official is immune from money damagesholding that the loss of money from a bank account does not constitute irreparable harm because that loss can be compensat ed by money damages & \n\nnot persuasive. Under the \u201cactual effects\u201d test, it is clear that Washington\u2019s percentage-based penalty provisions are not primarily imposed to compensate the state. The State\u2019s contention that it incurs costs in the collection of unpaid taxes is irrelevant because the provisions\u2019 \u201cactual effect\u201d has no direct relation to any specific costs incurred by the State. Furthermore, as the district court observed, other courts have held that escalating percentage-based penalties imposed in addition to interest are generally punitive rather than compensatory in effect. A The Tenth Circuit and a bankruptcy court in this circuit have concluded that pereent- age-based penalties for unpaid taxes were punitive rather than compensatory. See, e.g., In re Cassidy, 983 F.2d 161, 164-65 (10th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); In re E.A. Nord Company, Inc., 75 B.R. 634, holding that the defendant withheld pension benefits in breach of the planholding that the family courts award to exwife of interest in 387 of debtors military pension payable directly from the plan was not subject to discharge because interest in pension plan was not a debt rather it was considered exwifes separate ownership interestholding that an antiassignment clause in a pension plan is valid under 541c2 and that the pension benefits thus do not become property of the estate and may not be made subject to a pay order under section 1325cholding that irs ten percent assessmentlabelled a taxon premature withdrawal from pension plan funds was nonpecuniary loss penalty and thus not entitled to priority in bankruptcyholding that appropriate remedy was to compute service credit for veterans in accordance with vrra rather than pursuant to employers pension plan and requiring retroactive pension plan payments to be made & \n\nwhich he cannot in good conscience retain or withhold from another who is beneficially entitled to it as where money has been paid by accident, mistake of fact, or fraud, or has been acquired through a breach of trust or the violation of a fiduciary duty.\u2019 \u201d (quoting SSI Med. Servs. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 500, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793-94 (1990))); see All v. Prillaman, 200 S.C. 279, 308, 20 S.E.2d 741, 753 (1942) (\u201c \u2018The law will not permit a party to deliberately put his property out of his control for a fraudulent purpose, and then, through intervention of a court of equity, regain the same after his fraudulent purpose has been accom plished.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Jolly v. Graham, 222 Ill. 550, 78 N.E. 919, 920 (1906))). As to Issue III: Bowen v. Bowen, 352 S.C. 494, 499, 575 S.E.2d 553, 556 (2003) (<HOLDING>); Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. recognizing that the child custody act required that the natural parent presumption must be seriously considered and heavily weighted in favor of the parent but that the presumption is rebutted if the clear and convincing evidence establishes that the best interest of the child is served by awarding custody to the third partyholding an unborn child is not a child for purposes of criminal prosecution of mistreatment of a childholding when real estate is conveyed to a child and consideration is paid by the parent the presumption is that the purchase was a gift to the child and thus no resulting trust arisesholding that an outofwedlock childs pending claim for retroactive child support was nondischargeable in bankruptcy because a debt for child support arises upon the birth of the child and that the fact that no court had yet ordered the debtor to support the child does not take the debt outside the scope of 11 usc 523a5holding when real estate is conveyed to a child and consideration is paid by the parent the parent has the burden of proving a gift was not intended & \n\nsavings fund is his separate property. This court has long held that as a general rule, all property accumulated and acquired by either spouse during the marriage is part of the marital estate. See, generally, Davidson v. Davidson, 254 Neb. 656, 578 N.W.2d 848 (1998). Terry argues that because he brought the savings fund into the marriage, the savings fund was solely in his name, and he made the deposits to the savings fund, the entirety of the savings fund belongs to him. We disagree. Terry\u2019s argument ignores the fact that during the parties\u2019 marriage, the savings fund grew as a result of income Terry earned during the parties\u2019 marriage. Terry\u2019s income which accumulated during the parties\u2019 marriage was a marital asset. Compare, Meints v. Meints, 258 Neb. 1017, 608 N.W.2d 564 (2000) (<HOLDING>); Parde v. Parde, 258 Neb. 101, 602 N.W.2d 657 holding that separate property may become marital property if spouse donates it to marital unit with intent at time of donation that property become maritalholding income tax liability incurred during marriage is one of accepted costs of producing marital income and should be treated as marital debt for purposes of determining equitable distribution of marital estateholding that in determining whether a substantial change of circumstances has occurred trial court must consider income available to parents new marital communityholding trial court had no authority to award portion of the marital property to wifes children from another marriage even though money they received by way of social security benefits were commingled with the marital estate and used in part for the aequisition of marital propertyholding that circuit court erred in failing to consider that marital property in the form of marital earnings was used to pay debt against nonmarital property & \n\nnot contend that the interest would have been included in Thomas\u2019s bankruptcy estate on another basis. 4 . It is undisputed that Sherry did not obtain an equitable interest in the Property solely by virtue of marriage. Miller v. Fulton Cnty., 258 Ga. 882, 375 S.E.2d 864, 865 (1989) (\u2018\u2018[N]o property rights are created in the assets of the marriage while the parties are still married.\u201d). 5 . Likewise, the third-party testimony that the McFarlands presented at trial supports their position that they believed the property was jointly owned but not that there was an agreement to create a 'purchase money resulting trust. 6 . The presumption of a gift between spouses did not apply when the Property was purchased in 1968. See Woodward v. Woodward, 245 Ga. 550, 266 S.E.2d 170, 171-72 (1980) (<HOLDING>). But the code section relied on in Woodward holding that under minnesota law refinancing and consolidation of purchase money loans did not destroy their purchase money character for bankruptcy lien avoidance purposesholding that the statute of frauds applies to a sellers wife holding only a dower interest in the property so the wife must sign the purchase agreement as well as the seller husbandholding that there was no presumption of a gift where the wifes money was used to make the purchase but title was placed in the name of the husband and finding the facts sufficient to establish a purchase money resulting trust in favor of the wifeholding in case where stock was purchased but held in suspense account pending repayment of loan from seller that the fact that the money to purchase the now worthless stock was borrowed does not mean that money was not lostholding that a purchase money security in jewelry was not lost when the perfected purchase money security interest was consolidated with a subsequent retail installment contract & \n\n"}

[11 U.S.C section 1327 (1982).] Nothing in 11 U.S.C. section 1327, or elsewhere in chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, suggests that confirmation of the chapter 13 plan results in the case being closed or dismissed or a discharge being granted or denied. See also In re Herbert, 61 B.R. 44 (Bankr. W.D. La. 1986) (<HOLDING>) Therefore, there is no termination of the holding that refusal to provide chapter 7 debtor transcript because of default on student loan was a violation of the automatic stay based on the plain language of 11 usc 362holding that although the automatic stay only applies to proceedings against the debtor counterclaims seeking affirmative relief against a debtor implicate the automatic stayholding that the automatic stay provisions of section 362 remain in full force and effect during chapter 13 proceedings in order to prevent harassment of debtor while he attempts to rehabiliate himself and pay off some outstanding debtsholding that relief from the codebtor stay is mandated to the extent that the chapter 13 plan does not propose to pay the claim in fullrecognizing that in enacting 362 in 1978 congress significantly broadened the scope of the automatic stay & \n\nthe debtor, who could with impunity demand the return of property repossessed pre-petition informally, realizes that it cannot prevail and thus declines to file an adversary proceeding to recover the property. ORDER Pursuant to the foregoing Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, IT IS THE ORDER OF THIS COURT that Defendant, which repossessed Debtor\u2019s vehicle pre-petition, did not violate the automatic stay by refusing to voluntarily return the vehicle to Debtor after the Chapter 13 case was filed. Therefore, the Clerk is directed to enter judgment in favor of the Defendant. 1 . Of course sometimes creditors are told by debtors or individuals acting on a debtor\u2019s behalf that a case is pending when in fact it has not been filed. See In re Karis, 208 B.R. 913 (Bankr. W.D.Wis.1997) (<HOLDING>). Sometimes this representation is innocent as holding a tape of a telephone call was admissible because one party to the call consented to the recordingholding that utility customers mailing of a petition did not constitute the filing of the petition as filing was not effectuated until the petition was received by the clerkholding that telephone call from debtors attorney did not constitute notice of bankruptcy filing because petition had not in fact been filedholding that a debtors entitlement to an exemption under 522d1 is determined as of the filing date of a bankruptcy petitionholding pursuant to bankruptcy rule 7004b9 that because the creditor mailed the complaint and summons to the debtors attorney and to the address listed in the debtors bankruptcy petition service of process was sufficient even if the debtors were out of the country and did not actually receive notice of the complaint and summons & \n\nWeintraub and Resnick, Freezing, the Debtor\u2019s Account: A Banker\u2019s Dilemma Under the Bankruptcy Code, 100 Banking Law Journal 316, 321-22 (1983); Groschadl, \u201cFreezing\u201d the Debtor\u2019s Bank Account: A Violation of the Automatic Stay?, 57 American Bankruptcy Law Journal 75, 77 (1983); Freeman, Setoff Under the New Bankruptcy Code: The Effect on Bankers, 97 Banking Law Journal 484, 506 (1980). Unquestionably, if the funds in the bank accounts are indeed cash collateral, that is, if the bank has a valid claim within 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506(a), subject to a setoff not defeated by the exceptions in 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a), then the debtor in possession must obtain the Court\u2019s authorization or the bank\u2019s consent before drawing on the funds, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363(c)(2). See Cusanno v. Fidelity Bank, 29 B.R. at 812 (<HOLDING>). Since, if the bank is right about the status holding that a chapter 13 debtor should be able to obtain a copy of his transcript in light of the broader discharge provision of chapter 13holding that notwithstanding a debtors inability to obtain a chapter 13 discharge a debtor is nonetheless eligible to file a chapter 13 caseholding that there is no statutory authority in chapter 13 which grants a chapter 13 debtor independent standing to sue under the trustees avoidance powerrecognizing the requirement of 363 to obtain approval or consent in a chapter 13 caseholding tort action accruing after original chapter 7 petition not part of estate when case converted to chapter 13 and then back to chapter 7 & \n\nit was seeking an administrative claim for only the post-petition portion of the first quarter of 1995, which is from March 3, 1995 through March 31, 1995. The Debtors conceded that the administrative claim was proper to the extent that it covered only the post-petition portion of the first quarter of 1995. The claim of the IRS for administrative expenses for the post-petition portion of the first quarter of 1995 is allowable to the extent that it seeks taxes, fines and penalties. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 503(b)(l)(B)(C). The Court will determine whether post-petition interest is an administrative expense. 4 . Prior to the Court's decision, one circuit court had addressed the issue. See United States v. Friendship College, Inc. (In re Friendship College, Inc.), 737 F.2d 430, 433 (4th Cir.1984) holding that interest on postpetition taxes incurred by the debtor during chapter 11 reorganization is an administrative expenseholding confirmation vested property in the debtor and therefore properly of the estate was not liable for postconfirmation taxes incurred by debtorholding that an individual debtor not engaged in business is eligible for chapter 11holding in a case where a chapter 11 trustee was appointed after a period during which the debt or had operated as debtor in possession that a chapter 11 trustee has two years from the date of his appointment not from the commencement of the chapter 11 case to bring avoidance actionsholding that licensor was entitled to administrative expense priority claim where debtor remained in possession postpetition of real property under a license agreement & \n\nprotections afforded to the debtors by the Bankruptcy Code and the automatic stay, specifically because the Adversary Proceeding will determine whether the debtors were in default and thus whether Bank of America is entitled to recover from the guarantors. This, the court believes, is precisely what the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception encompasses. 10 . Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\nmotions are rendered moot by the dismissal of the appeal. While the request for posteonviction relief filed by Barnes was timely filed in accordance with Rule 37.2(c), which requires that, when a petitioner entered a plea of guilty, a petition under the Rule must be filed in the trial court within ninety days of the date of entry of judgment, the request for postconviction relief filed by Barnes was not properly verified. For that reason, it was subject to dismissal by the trial court. Keck v. State, 2013 Ark. 139, at 5, 2013 WL 1385240 (per curiam). Barnes could not circumvent the requirement that a [.\u00a1petition for postconviction relief be verified by labeling his petition as a motion to retract his guilty plea. See Lambert v. State, 2012 Ark. 310, at 2, 2012 WL 3373199 (per curiam) (<HOLDING>); see also Livingston v. State, 2014 Ark. 364, holding that because the petitioner had already filed a rule 371 petition he was barred from submitting a subsequent petition under that rule and his petition was subject to dismissal on that basis regardless of the label he placed on itholding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raised in the rule 32 petitionholding that a petition to correct sentence was properly considered as a petition for postconviction relief pursuant to rule 371 because it challenged a judgment entered on a plea of guilty on grounds cognizable under the ruleholding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raise in the rule 32 petitionholding that petition was properly filed even though the state court denied it as procedurally barred because the petition was delivered to and accepted by the state court & \n\ndid have a prepetition legal interest in that case. At the time of bankruptcy, \u00a7 172 of the Internal Revenue Code gave the debtor a claim for a tax refund if certain conditions were met. It was the combination of the law and the conditions made legally relevant by the law that conferred on the debtor a prepetition legal interest: the claim for a refund. In that way, the Segal debtors\u2019 claim for a refund is similar to the prepetition accrual of a cause of action that results in a post-petition judgment in the debtor\u2019s favor. In such eases, the debtor\u2019s cause of action is a prepetition legal interest \u2014 \u25a0\u00a7 541(a)(1) property- \u2014 -that brings the postpetition judgment into the estate as proceeds under \u00a7 541(a)(6). See, e.g., Wieburg v. GTE Southwest Inc., 272 F.3d 302, 306 (5th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Here, by contrast, Burgess suffered the crop holding that claims harming the debtor corporation that arose from prepetition conduct become property of the estate under 11 usc 541a1holding that causes of action for age and sex discrimination that arose prepetition were property of the bankruptcy estateholding that to make out the fourth element of a prima facie case of sex discrimination plaintiff must prove that males remained in similar positions and similarly for age discrimination that she was otherwise discharged because of her ageholding lost future wages recovered pursuant to a prepetition cause of action are property of the estateholding age discrimination claim barred & \n\n\u00b6 30; Adv. No. 03-09315, ECF Doc. #27, Exh. A. As this is the exact language of the clause in JLM that the Second Circuit held to be broad, the clauses in these four adversary proceedings should also be treated as broad form clauses. Therefore, under the Collins decision there is \u201ca presumption of arbitrability.\u201d Collins, 58 F.3d at 23. However, even with a broad form clause, if the claims present \u201cno questions in respect of the parties\u2019 rights and obligations under [the agreements],\u201d they are outside the purview of the arbitration clause and are not arbitrable. Id. B. Are the Preferential Transfer Claims Within the Scope of the Arbitration Agreement? In this Circuit, courts have exempted fraudulent transfer claims from arbitration because they are statutory claims belo (2d Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). However, none of those decisions undermines holding judgment in violation of automatic stay voidrecognizing district courts authority to dispose of contempt action for violation of automatic stay of bankruptcyholding that a postdischarge claim for violation of the automatic stay was arbitrable because it would not necessarily jeopardize or inherently conflict with the bankruptcy codeholding that the automatic stay did not bar the filing of a proof of claim where the debtor actively litigated a separate action during the pending bankruptcy proceeding because to permit the automatic stay provision to be used as a trump card played after an unfavorable result was reached would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the automatic stayrecognizing that any action taken in violation of the automatic bankruptcy stay is void and without effect & \n\nfrom trying to steal a march on each other, In re Holtkamp, 669 F.2d 505, 508 (7th Cir.1982), and the automatic stay is essential to accomplishing this purpose. There is, in contrast, no policy of preventing persons whom the bankrupt has sued from protecting their legal rights. True, the bankrupt\u2019s cause of action is an asset of the estate; but as the defendant in the bankrupt\u2019s suit is not by opposing that suit, seeking to take possession of it, subsection (a)(3) is no more applicable that (a)(1) is. Martin-Trigona v. Champion Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n., 892 F.2d 575, 577 (7th Cir. 1989). Accord, United States v. Inslaw, Inc., 932 F.2d 1467, 1473 (D.C.Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1048, 112 S.Ct. 913, 116 L.Ed.2d 813 (1992); Merchants & Farmers Bank of 10, 522-523 (Bankr.D.S.C.2014) (<HOLDING>). The Defendants in their Motion to Dismiss holding that a state is immune by virtue of 11 usc 106c from money damages for violating the automatic stay provision of 11 usc 362aholding that the plaintiffs 5629 action against the defendant for alleged fraudulent transfers was subject to the automatic stay provision 11 usc 362aholding that the protections of the automatic stay apply only to actions against the debtorholding that debtor did not prove that defendant creditors violated automatic stay under 11 usc 362a with respect to their actions in a state court lawsuit because the creditors actions involved a counterclaim that debtor asserted and were in response to that counterclaimholding that district court did not abuse its discretion in considering merits of state law counterclaim that formed part of the same case as federal counterclaim even though court had dismissed federal counterclaim quoting 28 usc 1367a & \n\ninto evidence true and accurate copies of the Note and Allonge. Petitioner asserts this evidence \u201cplainly evidences the transfers\u201d of the Note to Petitioner. We cannot agree. Under the UCC, as adopted by North Carolina, \u201c[a]n instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.\u201d N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 25-3-203(a) (2009). Production of an original note at trial does not, in itself, establish that the note was transferred to the party presenting the note with the purpose of giving that party the right to enforce the instrument, as demonstrated in Connolly, 63 N.C. App. at 551, 306 S.E.2d at 125, and Smathers v. Smathers, 34 N.C. App. 724, 726, 239 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1977) (<HOLDING>) In Connolly, determining who had possession of holding that because a mortgage provides the security for the repayment of the note the person having standing to foreclose a note secured by a mortgage may be either the holder of the note or a nonholder in possession of the note who has the rights of a holderholding that creditors could not seek relief from a bankruptcy stay because they were not the real parties in interest and lacked standing as they were not holders of the notes and failed to establish that mers was the holder or had authority to transfer the notesholding that where a promissory note had never been made payable to plaintiff or to bearer nor had it ever been indorsed to plaintiff defendants established that plaintiff was not the owner or holder of the noteholding that a promissory note is not enforceable against a party who signed the deed of trust but did not sign the promissory note inasmuch as promissory notes and deeds of trust are separate legal documents with unique purposesholding that despite evidence of voluntary transfer of promissory notes and the plaintiffs possession thereof the plaintiff was not the holder of the note under the ucc as the notes were not drawn issued or indorsed to her to bearer or in blank the plaintiff testified to some of the circumstances under which she obtained possession of the notes but the trial court made no findings of fact with respect thereto & \n\nforfeiture and to offer him a fair chance to present his claim of entitlement. See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v. Meza, 235 F.3d 287, 291 (7th Cir.2000); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (explaining that due process \u201ccalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\u201d). That said, the precedents shed some light on the government\u2019s obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurementholding us mail sufficient to give notice but mail cannot be expected to notify person who is missing or unknownholding rules of civil procedure are appropriate in determining what constitutes proper service by certified mailholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he was given sufficient notice of the administrative forfeiture proceeding through certified mailholding that if service done by certified mail action commenced upon receipt of summons and complaint & \n\nthat these taxes were discharged in the Joyes\u2019 bankruptcy case. 1. Section 1305 is entitled \u201cFiling and allowance of post-petition claims.\u201d Subsection (a) provides that \u201c[a] proof of claim may be filed by any entity that holds a claim against a debtor ... (1) for taxes that become payable to a governmental unit while the case is pending.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(a)(1). The parties do not dispute that the Joyes\u2019 bankruptcy case was pending from March 7, 2001 to March 4, 2004. Therefore, whether the Joyes\u2019 outstanding taxes give rise to a post-petition claim pursuant to section 1305(a)(1) depends on when these taxes became \u201cpayable\u201d for the purpose of that section. We have yet to construe the term \u201cpayable\u201d as used in section 1305(a)(1). See In re Savaria, 317 B.R. 395, 401 (9th Cir. BAP 2004) (<HOLDING>).

Accordingly, the court will deny claim six as procedurally barred. F. Claim Seven: Post-conviction Proceedings Violated Petitioner\u2019s Due Process And Equal Protection Rights In his seventh claim, petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance of his post-conviction appeal violated his right to equal protection and due process. He complains that the State Supreme Court failed to give a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of his Massiah claims. The court concludes that this claim alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas relief, because petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware State Courts\u2019 analysis in a state collateral proceeding. See Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir.1998)(<HOLDING>)(emphasis in original); see also Lambert v. holding habeas petitioners may show cause for such default in specific circumstances in states that require petitioners to raise iatc claims in initial state habeas proceedings rather than on direct appealholding that the federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioners conviction what occurred in the petitioners collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas proceedingholding federal habeas proceeding was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies when petitioners direct appeal from resentencing was still pending in state court at the time he sought habeas reliefholding that once federal jurisdiction has attached it is not defeated by the petitioners release prior to completion of the proceedings on his habeas applicationholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\ncourt with those facts relevant to the court\u2019s appellate review of agency action. Rule 80B(d) is not intended to allow the reviewing court to retry the facts that were presented to the governmental \u25a0 decision-maker, nor does it apply to any independent civil claims contained in the complaint. Rather, it is intended to allow the reviewing court to obtain facts not in the record that are necessary to the appeal before the court. See Palesky v. Secretary of State, 1998 ME 103, \u00b6\u00b6 5-9, 711 A.2d 129, 131-132. For example, the complainant may augment the record if there are claims of ex parte communication or bias alleged, with sufficient particularity, to have had an effect on the fairness of the governmental proceedings, see, e.g., White v. Town of Hollis, 589 A.2d 46, 48 (Me.1991) (<HOLDING>); Ryan v. Town of Camden, 582 A.2d 973, 975 holding that defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law which was denied by the district court when they made it at the close of the evidence limited the relief the appellate court could grant to a new trialholding that seventh application for postconviction relief which was rejected because evidence on which it was based was not properly authenticated was properly filedholding rule 80bd motion was properly denied because petitioner was not entitled to relief as a matter of lawholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he received notice and failed to properly file a claimholding that the defendants motion for discharge was premature and thus properly denied by the trial court & \n\nstudent\u2019s education, \u201cincluding] the conduct and development of evaluations, eligibility determinations, IEPs, and educational placement.\u201d Michael C. ex rel Stephen C. v. Radnor Twp. Sch. Dist., 202 F.3d 642, 654 (3d Cir.2000). No such proceeding concerning E.M.\u2019s education has been initiated. Although the Majority devotes pages to discussing whether this case is a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 1415, the proper inquiry is whether there exists a separate pending \u00a7 1415 proceeding, such as a due process complaint or an appeal of a ruling on such a complaint. Because \u201cstay put\u201d operates only \u201cMuring the pendency\u201d of such a proceeding, and no such proceeding has been initiated, \u00a7 1415\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d provision simply does not apply. See Moss by Mutakabbir v. Smith, 794 F.Supp. 11, 14 (D.D.C.1992) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, as the Majority acknowledges, there holding that the stay put provision establishes a strong preference but not a statutory duty for maintenance of the status quoholding that a federal action to enforce the stay put provision is not itself a pending proceeding under 1415 that triggers stay putholding that insurance guarantee association stay statute did not suspend limitation period because action was not pending when stay was enteredholding that the automatic stay did not bar the filing of a proof of claim where the debtor actively litigated a separate action during the pending bankruptcy proceeding because to permit the automatic stay provision to be used as a trump card played after an unfavorable result was reached would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the automatic stayholding that use of the preliminary injunction equitable factors would dilute the statutory framework under the stay put provision & \n\nagreement\u201d that \u201cachieved [plaintiffs] objective of obtaining injunctive relief to make [defendant\u2019s hotel] accessible\u201d). This is because a \u201cprevailing plaintiff ... should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d Barrios, 277 F.3d at 1134 (9th Cir.2002). The Ninth Circuit has held that an ADA plaintiff is a prevailing party if she: (1) \u201cachieve[s] a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d; and (2) that alteration is \u201cjudicially sanctioned.\u201d Jankey v. Poop Deck, 537 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir.2008). The second requirement can be met in many ways, including when a party enters into a legally enforceable agreement with the defendant. Barrios v. California Interscholastic Fed\u2019n, 277 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Carbonell v.

Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v.

Sufficiency of the Evidence In his sole issue, appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his DWI conviction. A. Standard of Review When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational fact finder could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

DISCUSSION The denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate presents a mixed question of law and fact, and we review the district judge\u2019s factual conclusions for clear error and questions of law de novo. Rhode v. United States, 583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and, consequently, must be construed liberally. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). District judges must resolve all claims for relief raised in habeas proceedings, regardless of whether relief is granted or denied.

See In re Refco Inc. (Memphis Holdings), 461 B.R. 181, 185 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.2011). This reasoning is flawed. It confuses the power to enter final judgment with the right to appeal. If there is no appeal, the grant of the motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is a final judgment dismissing the claim and is given res judicata and collateral estoppel effect. See Tel-tronics Servs. v. L M Ericsson Tele-comms., Inc., 642 F.2d 31, 34-35 (2d Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>); Corbett v. MacDonald Moving Servs., Inc., 124 holding parent company bound in subsequent action by res judicata effect of judgment against subsidiaryholding judgment under fed rcivp 12b6 is entitled to res judicata effectholding that dismissal on res judicata grounds is proper under rule 12b6 unless a disputed issue of material fact existsholding that lear does not abrogate general principles of res judicata or the res judicata effect of a consent decree regarding patent validityholding that dismissal of case on statute of limitations grounds is final judgment and barring appeal has res judicata effect & \n\nconsidered by the jury in its sentencing deliberations, this same evidence was also sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances concerning the commission of rape during the murders. See Berryhill v. State, 249 Ga. 442, 450-451 (11) (291 SE2d 685) (1982) (noting that the jury properly reconsiders all of the evidence from the guilt\/innocence phase in the sentencing phase). This same standard, which concerns the sufficiency of the evidence when reviewed on appeal, applies to Martin\u2019s claim here, which is essentially a claim that the trial court erred by not granting a directed verdict regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance at issue. See Miller v. State, 270 Ga. 741, 742 (1) (512 SE2d 272) (1999) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that the standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as the standard for a motion to dismissholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdict & \n\nversa. Id. This court reviews a district court\u2019s determination of inequitable conduct under a two-tiered standard: we review the underlying factual determinations of materiality and intent for clear error, and we review the ultimate decision as to inequitable conduct for an abuse of discretion. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1365. If the district court\u2019s inequitable conduct determination rests on a clearly erroneous finding of materiality or intent, it constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed. Id. We agree with Honda that the undisclosed 96RL information was material to the Three-Status patent because the jury found, and the court upheld, the asserted claims as anticipated by the 96RL system, and ACI has not appealed that decision to us. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291-92 (<HOLDING>). The materiality of the undisclosed holding that in reviewing a defendants motion for judgment of acquittal based on insanity which the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence the court must determine whether no reasonable jury could have failed to find that the defendants criminal insanity at the time of the offense was established by clear and convincing evidenceholding that if a claim is properly invalidated in district court based on the deliberately withheld reference then that reference is necessarily material because a finding of invalidity in a district court requires clear and convincing evidence a higher evidentiary burden than that used in prosecution at the ptoholding that a finding of fraud may be reversed only for clear error but that the finding must be judged in view of the clear and convincing burden of proofholding that fraud on the court must be supported by clear unequivocal and convincing evidenceholding that appellate court may infer that district court considered sentencing guidelines policy statements despite district courts failure to make explicit reference to them & \n\ninherent power \u201cto curb abuses and promote a fair process.\u201d Richardson, 76 Hawai'i at 507, 880 P.2d at 182. Accordingly, we reverse the ICA\u2019s ruling that the trial court abused its discretion in giving the instruction. B. Ford\u2019s Supplemental Document Productions Ford also challenges the ICA\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s partial denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to exclude Ford\u2019s supplemental production of documents. Preliminarily, plaintiffs styled their request as a \u201cmotion in limine,\u201d but based it on the rules of discovery. We thus construe the motion as a request for discovery sanctions, the denial of which we review under an abuse of discretion standard. See Kawamata Farms, 86 Hawai'i at 241, 948 P.2d at 1082. See also Thibeault v. Square D Co., 960 F.2d 239, 244 (1st Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). In their motion, plaintiffs cited HRCP Rule holding that the intent to discriminate under batson is a pure issue of fact subject to review under a deferential standardholding that the standard of review for an award of statutory damages is even more deferential than an abuse of discretion standardholding that the less deferential skidmore standard was a more appropriate standard to be applied to an agencys unpublished opinionrecognizing that the interaction of general constitutional rules governing pretrial identification procedures and the deferential standard of habeas review affords significant discretion to the state courtrecognizing the rock solid basis for such a deferential standard of review & \n\nThe consensual overhear applications and orders for eavesdropping devices worn on the person are not included in the appellate record as required by Supreme Court Rule 608(a)(6). See 210 Ill. 2d R. 608(a)(6) (the record on appeal must contain, among other things, eavesdropping orders and other similar documents). 4 Following oral argument, this court granted Stroud\u2019s motion to cite additional authority regarding the proper standard of review for eavesdropping necessity. Stroud argued that there was a split in the federal circuit courts regarding the proper standard of review. Our research reveals that the majority of circuits, including the Seventh Circuit, use an abuse of discretion standard of review. See United States v. Ramirez-Encarnacion, 291 F.3d 1219, 1222 n.l (10th Cir. 2002) (<HOLDING>), citing United States v. Phillips, 959 F.2d holding that the admission of evidence under an exception to the hearsay rule is reviewed for abuse of discretionholding that the conclusion that the wiretap was necessary in each situation is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and bringing the tenth circuit into accordance with the authority of a majority of other circuitsholding that the imposition of sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretionholding under third circuit law that the denial of a motion for reconsideration is reviewed for abuse of discretionholding under third circuit law that denial of rule 11 sanctions is reviewed for abuse of discretion & \n\nHRS \u00a7 11\u2014 13 that Kaho'ohalahala was a Lanai resident, which is a conclusion of law reviewable under the right\/wrong standard. Dupree states that the Board\u2019s determination that Kaho'ohalahala was not a Lanai resident is entitled to \u201ca presumption of validity[,\u201d] citing Keliipuleole v. Wilson, 85 Hawai'i 217, 226, 941 P.2d 300, 309 (1997). In Del Monte Fresh Produce (Hawaii), Inc. v. Int\u2019l Longshore & Warehouse Union, 112 Hawai'i 489, 146 P.3d 1066 (2006), this court identified the applicable standard of review as follows: An agency\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed de novo, while an agency\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error. A conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous stand 0, 179 P.3d 1050, 1053, 1056-57 (2008) (<HOLDING>). B. Jurisdiction \u201cThe existence of holding that we consider an agencys expertise or special knowledge when application of the regulation is primarily factual and necessarily requires application of the agencys technical knowledge and expertise to the facts presented citation omitted internal quotation marks omittedholding that when an administrative agencys decision was a mixed question of fact and law a reviewing court should apply a clearly erroneous standard of reviewholding that we show deference to an agencys conclusions in the area of its expertiseholding that where both mixed questions of fact and law are presented deference will be given to the agencys expertise and experience in the particular field and the court should not substitute its own judgment for that of the ageneyt and that the chief election officer did not clearly err in rejecting signatures on a petition for inclusion on the presidential ballot citation omittedholding that in general an agencys conclusion of law that presents mixed questions of fact and law is reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard but questions concerning whether an agency has followed proper procedures or considered the appropriate factors in making its determination are questions of law which are reviewed de novo & \n\nof a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, that \u201cthe question of the sufficiency of the evidence needed to go to the jury in a diversity case is a matter of federal law\u201d); Bank of Cali, N.A. v. Opie, 663 F.2d 977, 979 (9th Cir.1981) (\u201c[Fjederal law alone governs whether evidence is sufficient to raise a question for the trier-of-fact.\u201d). Applying that standard to the case before it, this court in Foster held that, at summary judgment, the plaintiff \u201cmust set forth evidence of a clear and convincing nature that, if believed by the ultimate factfinder, would establish that plaintiff was more likely than not the victim of illegal retaliation by her employer.\u201d Foster, 293 F.3d at 1195. See also Conrad v. Bd. of Johnson County Comm\u2019rs, 237 F.Supp.2d 1204, 1266-67 (D.Kan.2002) (<HOLDING>). Thus, although the state law dictated that a holding that federal courts sitting in diversity shall apply state substantive lawholding that federal courts sitting in diversity should apply state law that determines the outcome of the caseholding that if a state case explicitly states that the state standard is more favorable to the defendant than the federal standard the federal claim is considered adjudicated below when the state standard is appliedholding that a federal court sitting in diversity is bound to follow the law of the forum stateholding that for state law retaliatory discharge claims the clear and convincing standard is applied at the summary judgment stage at least when the claim is brought in a federal court sitting in diversity & \n\nthe State has met its burden to prove the child engaged in acts of delinquency, the statute has not supported such review since 1965 and urges us to adopt a standard of review identical to the review we conduct in criminal cases. Such a standard would require us to determine whether, viewing the light in the evidence most favorable to the State, any reasonable fact finder could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the juvenile committed the delinquent acts. See State v. Bash, 670 N.W.2d 135, 137 (Iowa 2003). As the State describes, before 1965, proceedings under chapter 232 were \u201cin equity.\u201d Iowa Code \u00a7 232.13 (1962). Thus our review on appeal was de novo, as it is in all equity cases. See Iowa R.App. P. 6.907. However, chapter 232 was substantially revised in 1965 App.2006) (<HOLDING>); In re A.D., 771 A.2d 45, 48 holding review of sufficiency of evidence of juvenile adjudication is same as reviewing substantial evidence to support a criminal convictionholding that an appellate court considers all evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and grants the state all reasonable inferencesholding that in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jurys verdictholding that when reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence all evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the governmentholding that in reviewing sufficiency of evidence in juvenile adjudication the appellate court considers the evidence most favorable to the judgment and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom and affirms if those inferences constitute substantial evidence & \n\nStates v.

Although vessel status is a substantive issue in that it relates to \u201cthe reach and application\u201d of the statute, Gonz\u00e1lez, 311 F.3d at 443, it is not an element of the offense. See 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 70504(a); United States v. Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir.2008). 18 . Other judge-determined issues are subject to higher and lower standards of proof. See, e.g., Huddleston v. United States, 485 U.S. 681, 690, 108 S.Ct 1496, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988) (noting that a court resolves a question of relevancy conditioned on fact by deciding \u201cwhether the jury could reasonably find the conditional fact\u201d); United States v.

Reply at 2. The court finds this argument speculative at best. In light of the \u201crelative unseemliness of a court\u2019s altering a legal ruling as to the same litigants,\u201d Zdanok, 327 F.2d at 953, the court needs greater justification to re visit Judge Johnson\u2019s ruling than conjecture about whether she forgot something or felt rushed. Because the defendant fails to offer such justification, its motion for reconsiderat 650 F.2d 663, 666 (5th Cir.1981) (finding that the grant of summary judgment for the defendant \"was so inconsistent with the plaintiff's request for leave to amend to state a new claim for relief as implicitly to deny the motion to amend\u201d); Wimberly v. Clark Controller Co., 364 F.2d 225, 227 (6th Cir.1966) (<HOLDING>). The de fendant attempts to distinguish cases holding that wjhile it is certainly the better practice to specifically rule on all pending motions the determination of a motion need not always be expressed but may be implied by an entiy of an order inconsistent with granting the relief soughtholding death sentence need not be pending in order for this court to engage in review of issues on appealholding order granting motion to withdraw plea to be the functional equivalent of an order granting a new trial because like a postverdict mistrial it returns case to posture it had been before trialholding that the scheduling order merely prescribes the date by which all motions to amend shall be filed the date on the scheduling order does not confine the district courts consideration of the merits of such motions and does not preclude it from finding that an amendment would result in prejudiceholding interpretation may not be inconsistent with regulation & \n\nto enter no judgment prior to the close of the evidence.\u201d Id. In light of the substantial evidence supporting the court\u2019s finding of causation, see infra, we cannot conclude that the district court's decision not to rule on the Rule 52(c) motion was an abuse of discretion. Riverboat also asserts that, in reviewing the district court\u2019s decision, we should evaluate the record at the close of the plaintiffs' case^\u2014 the time at which the motion was made\u2014 rather than the record as a whole. Riverboat's position is not supported by our case law nor by Rule 52(c). The defendants can point us to no rule of law that prohibits us, in reviewing the district court\u2019s Rule 52(c) order, from evaluating the record as a whole. See Duval v. Midwest Auto City, Inc., 578 F.2d 721, 723-24 (8th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>). 30 .

We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\ncourt harmless. The district court stated that although the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cwould have no impact upon the [c]ourt\u2019s sentencing decision,\u201d it would impact the court\u2019s decision if \u201cthe Supreme Court later determine[d] that Blakely [v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)] extends to federal sentencing.\u201d As mentioned above, the special verdict indicated that Soreide was responsible for $7 million to $20 million in actual loss and more than $20 million in intended loss, and that he participated as an organizer or leader. Because these jury findings were identical to those made by the sentencing judge and because they would be applied upon resentencing, any constitutional error was harmless. See United States v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). As for Soreide\u2019s claim of statutory Booker holding that in order to conclude that federal constitutional error is harmless court must find that error harmless beyond a reasonable doubtholding a constitutional booker error harmless on the ground that because the district court stated its sentence would be the same even if the guidelines were only advisory we know with certainty beyond a reasonable doubt what the district court would do upon remandholding that apprendi error is harmless if the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the result would have been the same absent the error internal quotation marks and citation omittedholding that booker constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because on remand the district court would have given defendant the same sentenceholding that before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt & \n\n316 F.3d 939, 948 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cSeverino admitted \u2014 more than once \u2014 that he had no way to challenge the validity of the prior conviction....

Due process requires a DHO to produce and review evidence alleged by a prisoner to be supportive of his defense unless do ing so would be \u201cunduly hazardous to institutional safety or correctional goals.\u201d Wolff, 418 U.S. at 566, 94 S.Ct. 2963; Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, 487 F.3d 808, 813-14 (10th Cir.2007). But assuming, without deciding, that the DHO in this case committed error by refusing to consider the work-crew log, the error was harmless to Mitchell and therefore cannot form the basis of a due process claim. See Howard, 487 F.3d at 814-15 & n. 5 (<HOLDING>); of. Grossman v. Bruce, 447 F.3d 801, 805 holding that error will not be presumed from a silent record and that without the relevant transcript there is insufficient evidence to review the alleged error and the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating the alleged error in the recordrecognizing that a dhos unjustified refusal to review a videotape alleged to be exculpatory might constitute harmless error and remanding to the district court to make a determination of harmlessness on a fuller factual recordholding that the district courts review of a partial and truncated record was error and remanding the case for review on the entire administrative recordholding that the district court did not have jurisdiction and remanding the matter to state courtholding that chapman harmless error review will be conducted when error is tested for harmlessness for the first time on habeas & \n\nabuse of discretion. VI. Finally, the failure to give eyewitness identification instructions was not harmless. To reiterate, the State lacked any evidence directly connecting Cabinatan to the charged offenses. The testimony of Kincaid was in some respects inconsistent with the police report she filled out before viewing Cabina-tan. Also, her identification was the result of the inherently suggestive environment of a police showup. Cabinatan presented alibi evidence that indicated that he was not present when the thefts occurred. Hence, there was a reasonable possibility that the absence of eyewitness instructions caused the jury to place undue weight on Kincaid\u2019s testimony; thus contributing to Cabinatan\u2019s conviction. See State v. Pauline, 100 Hawai'i 356, 378, 60 P.3d 306, 328 (2002) (<HOLDING>) (internal quotation marks omitted). Absent holding that error is considered harmless if it is established beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict or alternatively stated that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the convictionholding that the harmless error test places a burden on the state to prove that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict or alternatively stated that there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the convictionholding that under the harmless error standard an appellate court must determine whether there is a reasonable possibility that the error complained of might have contributed to the convictionholding that harmless error test is satisfied when there is no reasonable possibility that the error contributed to the convictionholding that an error is harmless if there is no reasonable possibility that it contributed to the conviction & \n\nof the items\u201d does not permit the conclusion that the court gave little or no consideration to the erroneously admitted evidence of the perjury conviction in determining what weight to give the testimony of LeBray. The court could have attributed greater credibility to LeBray\u2019s testimony and drawn more extensive inferences from it precisely because it rejected Pierce\u2019s denial of possession to police based on the court\u2019s admission of evidence of Pierce\u2019s prior perjury conviction. Applying harmless error terminology, neither the \u201ccumulative\u201d evidence nor the \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence formulation of harmless error analysis supports the conclusion that the admission of the challenged evidence was harmless. See, e.g., Brecht, 507 U.S. at 639, 113 S.Ct. at 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d at 373-74 (<HOLDING>); Lane, 474 U.S. at 450, 106 S.Ct. at 732, 88 holding improperly admitted evidence may be harmless if cumulativeholding improperly admitted testimony was cumulative to the other properly admitted evidence and was therefore harmlessholding improperly admitted evidence was harmless error given the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding improperly admitted evidence may be harmless if other evidence of guilt is overwhelming and the error is insignificant by comparisonholding that when evidence was erroneously admitted such error was harmless when the evidence was insignificant and cumulative & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nwas admissible. The likelihood that a different result would have been reached (no verdict of death) if a properly worded jury instruction had been given, is remote. Therefore, the harmless error analysis offered by the Warden is correct. Claims 25 and 26 are dismissed. NRS 34.770(2). Exhibit R5, pp. 979-81. Rogers appealed. See Exhibit P563. On May 13, 2002, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed. Exhibit P564. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed, on procedural grounds, the dismissal of Rogers\u2019 claims regarding the torture, depravity of mind, or e in this case, providing for a depravity-of-mind aggravating circumstance, was unconstitutionally vague. See Valerio v. Crawford, 306 F.3d 742, 747 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 994, 123 S.Ct. 1788, 155 L.Ed.2d 695 (2003) (<HOLDING>); Deutscher v. Whitley, 884 F.2d 1152, 1162 holding unconstitutionally vague under the reasoning of godfrey an aggravatingcircumstances instruction directing jurors to determine whether the murder was especially heinous atrocious and cruelholding factor b is not unconstitutionally vagueholding the same nevada aggravating circumstance unconstitutionally vague under godfreyholding that oklahomas especially heinous atrocious or cruel aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vagueholding that an aggravating circumstance in the georgia death penalty statute was unconstitutionally vague & \n\nof sentencing would, in effect, permit the Rule to read: \u201ca determination that no such finding was necessary because the matter controverted was not taken into account in sentencing.\u201d We reject such a reading of the Rule. II We next address what the Rule requires when a district court complies with the substantive requirements of the Rule, but fails to append to the presentence report the appropriate findings or determinations resolving the controverted matters. We hold that such a technical violation of the Rule is a ministerial error which does not require resentencing. The technical error must, however, be corrected by ordering the district court to append to the pre-sentence report the required findings or determinations. United States v. Knockum, 881 F.2d 730, 732 (9th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>); U.S. v. Gattas, 862 F.2d 1432, 1435; (10 holding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raise in the rule 32 petitionholding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raised in the rule 32 petitionholding that a courts failure to provide a defendant with any portion of a habeas transcript was errorholding that error will not be presumed from a silent record and that without the relevant transcript there is insufficient evidence to review the alleged error and the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating the alleged error in the recordholding that ministerial error of failing to append rule 32 findings or determinations will not permit habeas relief because the error may be remedied by ordering the district court to attach the sentencing transcript & \n\nIf the defendant perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law is satisfied, and only if the defendant is aware that his death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing. Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it. See Garrett v. Collins, 951 F.2d 57, 59 (5th Cir.1992) and Lowenfield v. Butler, 843 F.2d 183, 187 (5th Cir.1988) (both quoting and relying on this excerpt from Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in Ford, 477 U.S. at 422, 106 S.Ct. 2595 (Powell, J., concurring), in denying competency-to-be-executed habeas relief); see also Fearance, 56 F.3d at 640 and Barnard, 13 F.3d at 876 n. 2 (<HOLDING>). Counsel for Panetti suggests this Court holding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the standard for determining competency to plead guilty is whether the defendant has a rational understanding of the proceedingsholding that the fifth circuit has adopted the powell concurrence as the standard for competency to be executedholding that no exception to the invited error doctrine has ever been adopted by this circuitholding competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving right to counsel is same as competency standard for standing trial and disapproving contrary holding of masthers & \n\nto witnesses. Trial Tr. at 360-61, 365, 387-89, 404, 423, 441, 466, 481, 496-97, 562-63, 577, 645. Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, then, a review of the record shows there could have been a disparity between the movements of the parties during the trial that violated Earhart\u2019s \u201cSixth Amendment right to act as his own attorney,\u201d rebutting any factual determination to the contrary. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). A violation of the Sixth Amendment right to conduct one\u2019s own defense is a structural trial error not subject to the harmless-error rule; thus, whether Earhart was prejudiced is irrelevant in determining whether his movement restrictions violated his right to self-representation. McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168, 173, 174, 177, 177 n. 8, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984) (<HOLDING>).

He identified each of the certified issues as section headings and explicitly referenced precedents regarding the right to counsel at a preliminary hearing, as well as the district court\u2019s ruling below noting that a denial of Faretta rights is subject to harmless error analysis. Appellant\u2019s Opening Brief at 37-38. Therefore, it is appropriate to reach the merits of the certified issues. HALL, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part: I believe that Ramirez waived the issues certified for appeal, and so I dissent. A habeas petitioner who fails to address the issues certified for appeal waives those issues. Koerner v. Grigas, 328 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>) (citations and quotation marks omitted).

Thus, whether or not the state court erred under Alabama law in its rulings at Davis\u2019 trial is \u201clargely beside the point\u201d in the court\u2019s analysis. Jammed v. Van de Kamp, 926 F.2d 918, 920 (9th Cir.1991). IV. DISCUSSION Davis seeks habeas corpus relief as to his sentence of death based upon the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Roper, supra, and the court addresses this claim first. Davis also has raised and briefed six constitutional guilt-phase claims attacking the validity of his judgment of conviction which the court will address in the order in which the claims are asserted by Davis. See Clisby v. Jones, 960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). A.

Lucas names no individual officers. The Ex Parte Young exception applies only in actions against individual state officers, and not to state agencies. See id. Therefore, the Ex Parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is inapplicable here, thus barring action against the Board. For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM the dismissal of the declaratory judgment by the District Court. 1 . On appeal, Lucas cites two exceptions to the doctrine of Ex Parte Young. See Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997) (<HOLDING>); Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 holding a suit against an agency of the state is a suit against the stateholding that while the fourteenth amendment is directed against state action and not private action the state action requirement is met in a civil action where state law is applied whether by statute or common lawholding that a damages suit against a state officer in his official capacity was barred because it was functionally a suit against the stateholding that an action cannot be maintained under young in unique circumstances where the suit against the state officer affects an essential attribute of state sovereignty in a manner that the action must be understood as one against the stateholding that an action against an officer was not an action against the state because the relief sought would not take away any property of the state or fasten a lien on it or interfere with the disposition of funds in the treasury & \n\nhurt. But these types of dangerous conditions fall well short of establishing a condition that is certain to cause injury. III. Plaintiff alternatively relies on the principle that a \u201ccontinuously operative dan gerous condition\u201d may form the basis for a claim under the Act\u2019s intentional-tort exception. The Michigan Supreme Court has observed that \u201c[a] continuously operative dangerous condition may form the basis of a claim under the intentional tort exception only if the employer knows the condition will cause an injury and refrains from informing the employee about it.\u201d Giles v. Ameritech, 468 Mich. 897, 660 N.W.2d 72, 73 (2003) (emphasis added) (citing Travis, 551 N.W.2d at 145); Alexander, 660 N.W.2d 67; Upsher v. Grosse Pointe Pub. Sch. Sys., 285 F.3d 448, 455-56 (6th Cir. 2002) (<HOLDING>). The key is that the employee is left in the recognizing that georgia did not adopt 115 but even if it did finding that plaintiff did not consider removal of asbestos to be immediately necessary where there was an undisputed delay between plaintiffs discovery of the hazard and beginning of removalholding that the special relationship exception did not apply because the decedent was not in defendants custodyholding that the workers disability compensation acts intentionaltort exception did not apply where plaintiffs suffered injury after being instructed to remove carpet under which there was asbestos because the plaintiffs had shown only that the defendants knew of the general dangers of asbestos and did not provide proper training or safety equipmentholding that new statute which required proof that asbestos exposure was substantial contributing factor to claimants medical condition could be applied to pending cases and did not abrogate claimants vested right because she was still able to pursue her cause of action and recover for injury caused by her husbands exposure to asbestos statute merely affected methods and procedure by which that action was recognized protected and enforced not the cause of action itselfholding under facts presented that new statute could be applied to plaintiffs case because she was still able to pursue cause of action for injury caused by husbands exposure to asbestos & \n\nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit stated that \u201cthe presumption of reliability that serves as the premise for the public-records exception does not attach to third parties who themselves have no public duty to report.\u201d Jordan v. Binns, 712 F.3d 1123, 1133 (7th Cir. 2013) (refusing to admit \u201cthird-party statements contained in a police report\u201d). See also United States v. Morales, 720 F.3d 1194, 1202 (9th Cir. 2013) (\u201cIn general, statements by third parties who are not government employees ... may not be admitted pursuant to the public records exception but must satisfy some other exception in order to be admitted.\u201d). Thus, the responses to the questionnaires must themselves fall within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rale. Cf. In re G.Y., 962 P.2d 78, 85 (Utah Ct. App. 1998) (<HOLDING>). Because the Spa does not contend that the holding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were madeholding that exclusion of hearsay statements violated due process even though statements were not admissible under mississippi law which did not recognize declarations against penal interest as a exception to the rule against hearsayholding that factors used in determining whether hearsay statements are sufficiently reliable to satisfy hearsay exceptions also apply to whether statements have sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness under confrontation clauseholding that thirdparty statements contained in dcfs caseworker reports constituted hearsayrecognizing that the united states constitution may require courts to admit exculpatory hearsay statements that do not fall within any recognized hearsay exception & \n\nlaw upon which they had been relying to sue the RAC defendants on statutory grounds. See Brief for Appellants at 71. Prior to the notification, the crux of the concern of the RAC plaintiffs was that RAC officials failed to communicate federal rights to minority applicants. The RAC defendants provide no assurances, other than this notification, that the same behavior has not and will not continue. In fact, the plaintiffs provide some evidence, through the Warda Thomas and Felicia Stokes testimony and the RAC handouts, that RAC has not complied with this notification. Even assuming the defendants had ceased the allegedly illegal conduct, we will not dismiss the claims as moot if the harm is \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d Southern Pacific, 219 U.S. at 515, 31 S.Ct. at 283 (<HOLDING>). Otherwise, such orders effectively would holding ease not moot when challenged administrative order expired because icc proceedings are continuing and their consideration ought not be defeated by short term orders capable of repetition yet evading reviewholding that challenge to expired fiveyear npdes permits originally issued eight years earlier was capable of repetition yet evading reviewrecognizing a mootness exception for abortion litigation because pregnancy truly could be capable of repetition yet evading review holding that we have no difficulty concluding that challenge to expired fiveyear npdes permit was capable of repetition yet evading reviewholding that a party may not invoke the capable of repetition yet evading review exception where its failure to obtain prompt relief has prevented judicial review & \n\n467 U.S. at 655, 104 S.Ct. 2626. The Court decided, however, that the danger to unsuspecting civilians sufficed to apply the exception. Id. at 657, 104 S.Ct. 2626; see also United States v. Liddell, 517 F.3d 1007, 1008 (8th Cir.2008) (applying exception when after defendant was removed from his car, arrested, handcuffed, and put in back of police car, police found an unloaded gun under front seat and then asked whether there was \u201canything else in [the car] we need to know about\u201d); New-some, 475 F.3d at 1225 (determining that exception applied where defendant was handcuffed on floor because \u201cofficers reasonably believed that they were in danger\u201d); Luker, 395 F.3d at 835 (applying exception where defendant had already been arrested, handcuffed, and patted down); Newton, 369 F.3d at 678 (<HOLDING>); Lackey, 334 F.3d at 1225-27 (finding \u201ca real holding that exception applies to statement by handcuffed defendant as to location of a gun in an apartment even where most of the other adults in the apartment were handcuffed because even assuming the executing officers believed that the residence was secure the circumstances were still sufficiently dangerousholding that exception applies to statement by handcuffed parolee concerning whereabouts of a gun in an apartment where parole officers had specific information from a third party that a gun was likely present in the apartmentholding that the defendant had a duty to retreat from the doorway between his apartment and the apartment hallway because that area functioned as a hybrid privatepublic spaceholding that the defendant had no expectation of privacy in the hallway of an apartment building where the building door was unlocked and the hallway was easily accessible to the publicholding that public safety issue remained notwithstanding that newton was handcuffed and in hallway outside his apartment because the unlocated gun presented a deadly risk to everyone on the premises & \n\n8.) 4 . Defendants filed a Suggestion of Mootness [Doc. # 77] on June 6, 2000. Attached is the Affidavit of David C. Lanier. Mr. Lanier is the registrar at UNC, and he testifies that Ms. Jennings has graduated from UNC. (Lanier Aff. \u00b6 3.) Plaintiffs have not responded. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), courts can look beyond the pleadings to determine a matter on standing. Smith v. Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, 290 F.3d 201, 205 (4th Cir.2002). Only Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) converts to a summary judgment when additional evidence is examined. Id. 5 . If preemption is found, Plaintiffs will be precluded from suing officials in their individual capacities under Title IX. See Kinman v. Omaha Pub. Sch. Dist., 171 F.3d 607, 611 (8th Cir. 1999) (<HOLDING>). 6 . The Supreme Court recognizes that Federal holding title ix does not support an action against official in an individual capacityholding that in a bivens action service upon employee in his official capacity does not amount to service in his individual capacityholding that a claim for damages exists in an action to enforce title ixholding that a claim for retaliation does not lie under title ixholding that the doctrine of qualified immunity does not protect a government official who is sued in an official capacity under title vii because title vii does not impose personal liability & \n\nthat the appellant is ... unable to provide now or in the future.\u201d The record demonstrates that S.O. is doing very well in her foster placement. Esser and Jones testified that S.O. has formed a strong bond with her siblings, and that maintaining a relationship with her siblings is in her best interest. But even if maintaining S.O.\u2019s out-of-home placement with her siblings is in her best interest, that is not a sufficient reason to terminate her father\u2019s parental rights. The best interest of the child is a \u201cparamount\u201d concern, but termination of parental rights is contingent upon a finding under MinmStat. \u00a7 260C.301, subd. 1(b), that at least one of the statutory conditions, such as palpable unfitness, is met. MinmStat. \u00a7 260C.301, subd. 7 (2012); see also R.W., 678 N.W.2d at 54-55 (<HOLDING>). II. Appellant also argues that he was never recognizing policy and ruling that person who failed to file counterclaim when childs paternity was being determined in earlier litigation should not be allowed to bring later suit to establish that he was childs natural father as this would not be in the childs best interestsholding that it was error to base a tpr decision solely on the childs best interestholding that a modification of custody should not be based on one parents default because it is the childs best interests that are at stakeholding that a childs preference regarding parental contact is not determinative of the best interest analysis and that a court must assess a childs best interest in light of all statutory factorsholding that when information which potentially undermines the best interest of the child as well as the interest sought to be protected by the legitimation statutes and the policy of this state it must first be tested in light of the best interest of the child standard & \n\nprotections afforded to the debtors by the Bankruptcy Code and the automatic stay, specifically because the Adversary Proceeding will determine whether the debtors were in default and thus whether Bank of America is entitled to recover from the guarantors. This, the court believes, is precisely what the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception encompasses. 10 . Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\ncarving out exceptions for certain kinds of markets. E.g., UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 216, 110 S.Ct. 2807 (citing Illinois Brick, 431 U.S. at 744, 97 S.Ct. 2061); Del. Valley, 523 F.3d at 1124 (same). Neither do they depend on case-specific factors. See UtiliCorp, 497 U.S. at 216-17, 110 S.Ct. 2807 (observing that Illinois Brick\u2019s rationale \u201cwill not apply with equal force in all cases\u201d and that its economic assumptions \u201cmight be disproved in a specific case,\u201d but affirming its brightline rule regardless). The exceptions cover situations where either Illinois Brick\u2019s concern over multiple recovery and apportionment does not apply, or its policy of encouraging private antitrust suits would be stymied by mechanical application of its bright-line rule. See Shamrock Foods, 729 F.2d at 1214 (<HOLDING>); Royal Printing, 621 F.2d at 326 n. 7 holding that the policy considerations identified in illinois brick do not apply in coconspirator casesholding that state substantive rules of decision apply in federal diversity casesrecognizing that the federal rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing hearingsholding that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity casesholding that state courts must apply the federal pleading standard in fela cases & \n\nor a balance of the conveniences is on the party seeking to proceed with the second action. See First City Nat\u2019l Bank & Trust Co. v. Simmons, 878 F.2d 76, 79 (2d Cir.1989). One such special circumstance warranting an exception to the first filed rule occurs when a party files a declaratory judgment action after receiving notice of a planned lawsuit by its adversary. See Factors Etc., Inc. v. Pro Arts, Inc., 579 F.2d 215, 219 (2d Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 908; 99 S.Ct. 1215, 59 L.Ed.2d 455 (1979) (\u201cWhen the declaratory judgment action has been triggered by a notice letter, this equitable consideration may be a factor in the decision to allow the later filed action to proceed to judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019 chosen forum.\u201d); Federal Insurance Co., 808 F.Supp. at 349-50 (<HOLDING>); Sharimalia Food Corp. v.

Courts agree that a \u201cmarket\u201d rate of interest should apply. See Koopmans, 102 F.3d at 874-75; In re Smithwick, 121 F.3d at 214; In re Valenti, 105 F.3d at 63; GMAC, 999 F.2d at 66-67; United Carolina Bank, 993 F.2d at 1129-30; In re Fowler, 903 F.2d 694, 697 (9th Cir.1990); In re Hardzog, 901 F.2d at 859-60; Arnold, 878 F.2d at 927-28; see also Pearson, supra at 40-41; Epstein, supra at 443. There is disagreement, however, about what rate of interest will adequately ensure that the creditor receives full value of his secured claim. 1. Under one approach, known as the \u201ccost of funds method,\u201d the interest rate is set at the rate the creditor would have to pay to borrow the amount equal to the collateral\u2019s value. See In re Valenti 105 F.3d at 64 (<HOLDING>); 8 Lawrence P. King et al., Collier on holding that although cost of funds approach more appropriately reflects the present value of a creditors allowed claim it is difficult to administer and therefore the interest rate should be fixed at the rate on a united states treasury instrument with a maturity equivalent to the repayment schedule under the debtors reorganization planholding that bankruptcy plan of reorganization rather than 1961 controlled the setting of the interest rateholding that the petitioner can claim no rate as a legal right other than the filed rate whether fixed or merely accepted by the agency commissionholding that once a rate is filed with the appropriate agency except for review of the agencys orders the courts can assume no right to a different rate on that ground that in its opinion it is the only or the more reasonable rateholding that the proper rate for prejudgment interest is the rate fixed by the parties in a contract & \n\nfor the sale of any lands, or any interest in lands, shall be void, unless the contract, or some note or memorandum thereof be in writing, and signed by the party by whom the lease or sale is to be made, or by some person thereunto by him lawfully authorized in writing ... .[ ] The easement granted by Hoover over his property, lot 2, for the benefit of Zaher and his property, lot 3, was reduced to a written document. Under the statute of frauds, however, to transfer an interest in property, all parties possessing an interest in the subject property must sign the document. Forge, 458 Mich at 206 (\u201c[a]ll owners of jointly held property must sign a contract conveying an interest in the property,\u201d e.g., an easement in Forge); Slater Mgt Corp v Nash, 212 Mich App 30, 32; 536 NW2d 843 (1995) (<HOLDING>). It is undisputed that Hoover\u2019s wife, Linda, holding that the equal rights amendment requires that wife as well as husband be permitted to recover for loss of consortiumholding that the statute of frauds applies to a sellers wife holding only a dower interest in the property so the wife must sign the purchase agreement as well as the seller husbandholding a wife liable for necessary medical expenses incurred by her husband under the doctrine even though the wife did not sign as a guarantor and did not request that her husband be admitted nor anticipate that her husband would be admittedholding that a reservation clause gave a life estate to a spouse pursuant to a deed reserving use of the property to both husband and wife for life even though the husband had no interest in the propertyholding that because the wife failed to present any evidence as to the legal services performed in the trial court the wife was not entitled to a second hearing to establish attorneys fees & \n\ndisabled to the extent he would not be able to function in prison or in the population upon release without control of his delusional disorder.\u201d Citing United States v. McAllister, 969 F.Supp. 1200, 1207-08 (D.Minn.1997), Green argues that \u201c[i]f the \u2018gravely disabled\u2019 language in the [Policy] were not read to require a showing of dangerousness within the institution, the [Policy] would be unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause.\u201d True, Harper's specific holding is that Due Process allows an inmate to be treated \u201cif [he] is dangerous to himself or others\u201d and (2) when \u201cthe treatment is in the inmate\u2019s medical interest.\u201d Harper, 494 U.S. at 227, 110 S.Ct. 1028. The Harper opinion does not make these criteria the only basis for involuntary medication. See id. at 227, 110 S.Ct. 1028 (<HOLDING>). The Supreme Court has explained that an holding that the due process clause permits the state to involuntarily treat a prison inmate who is seriously mentally ill if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmates medical interestholding that inmate has a liberty interest under the due process clause to refuse the involuntary administration of psychotropic drugsholding that the due process clause permits the state to treat a prison inmate with antipsychotic drugs against his will under certain circumstances while not limiting treatment to those circumstancesholding that prisoners possess a significant liberty interest in avoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and identifying procedures which comported with due processholding that the due process clause permits the state to treat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with antipsychotic drugs against his will if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmates medical interest & \n\nonly after a responsible agency official assesses whether \u201cthe public interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in disclosure\u201d\u2014was met. See Pac. Gas, 70 Fed.Cl. at 144 (quoting Marriott, 437 F.3d at 1307). Next, Kansas contends that the government has not sufficiently \u201cidentified or described\u201d the documents by stating with particularity what information is subject to the privilege. Having reviewed the government\u2019s privilege logs (both initial and supplemental), the Court concludes that the government\u2019s descriptions were sufficient to enable the Court to determine whether the privilege was applicable, and that, in any event, the Court has now conducted an in camera review of the documents withheld. See Cencast Servs., L.P. v. United States, 91 Fed.Cl. 496, 503 (2010) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the Court concludes that the holding that documents reflecting the department of educations review of a universitys compliance with title iv were covered by the privilege and rejecting the argument that a specific policy judgment is necessary for the privilege to apply because the privilege servesto protect the processes by which governmental decisions as well as policies are formulatedholding that defendants privilege login combination with the in camera review requested by plaintiffsis adequate to determine whether the elements of the privilege have been establishedrecognizing privilegeholding that production of documents without a claim of privilege waives the right to later claim that privilegeholding that a complete prohibition against an opponents use of in camera review to establish the applicability of the crimefraud exception to the attorneyclient privilege is inconsistent with the policies underlying the privilege & \n\nof the precluded evidence\u201d on Oatts\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights and the \u201cstate\u2019s interests in excluding the evidence at issue.\u201d Tague, 3 F.3d at 1137-1138. We first address the state\u2019s interest in excluding the evidence by noting the policy of Indiana\u2019s Rape Shield Rule. The Rule reflects a policy first embodied in Indiana\u2019s Rape Shield Act, Indiana Code \u00a7 35-37-4^1, that inquiry into a victim\u2019s prior sexual activity is sufficiently problematic that it should not be permitted to become a focus of the defense. Rule 412 is intended to prevent the victim from being put on trial, to protect the victim against surprise, harassment, and unnecessary invasion of privacy, and, importantly, to remove obstacles to reporting sex crimes.

We uphold such findings if they are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. See Batakis v. Town of Belmont, 135 N.H. 595, 597, 607 A.2d 956, 957 (1992). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Under these circumstances, the owner of the dominant estate may deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. Cf. Haley v. Colcord, 59 N.H. 7, 9 (1879) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling holding that an easement is not a separate estate when dominant and servient tracts are under the same ownershipholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estateholding that the burden on the servient estate cannot be increased without the consent of the owners of the servient estate and that the owner of the dominant estate to which the appurtenant easement is attached has no power to convey or expand use of that easement in connection with a tract of land owned by anotherrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that dominant tenant may deviate from path of prescriptive easement to extent reasonably necessary to pass around obstruction created by servient tenant & \n\nSee, e.g., Goldberg v. Miller, 371 Md. 591, 603, 810 A.2d 947, 954 (2002) (\u201cThis Court has long recognized the parents\u2019 obligation to support their minor children. This obligation imposes a duty on the parent to provide support and confers a right on children to receive it.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). This duty is confirmed in the common law, see id., and in our statutes. See Md.Code Ann., Fam. Law (1984, 2006 Repl. Vol. & Supp.2009) \u00a7 5-203 (Parents are \u201cjointly and severally responsible for the child\u2019s support, care, nurture, welfare, and education.... \u201d). The duty is so important that a parent may not \u201cbargain away\u201d or waive his\/her minor child\u2019s right to receive support. See Stambaugh v. Child Support Enforcement Admin., 323 Md. 106, 111-12, 591 A.2d 501, 503-504 (1991) (<HOLDING>).

Plaintiff has acknowledged in deposition that holding that neglect was not excusable where the defendants did not do all that they were required to do after they received the summons and complaint in that they did not contact a lawyer or make any other arrangements with respect to their defenseholding that plaintiffs lacked standing to seek injunctive relief because they failed to demonstrate any likelihood that they would end up back in jail where alleged constitutional violations occurredholding that an inmates complaint was not sufficient to state a claim against the director or warden of the prison absent an allegation that they were directly involved in the alleged misconduct or recklessly indifferent to the constitutional violations of which they had some knowledgeholding that district court erred in dismissing inmates complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies when court did not address inmates allegation that prison officials failed to provide necessary grievance formsholding that plaintiffs had standing because they were directly affected by the laws and practices against which their complaints were directed & \n\n96 S.Ct. 984. However, \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate\u2019s preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immunity.\u201d Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606. A defendant pleading absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question. Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 487, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991). The defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity prevails only in part. They are correct that they have absolute immunity for offering the tape recording into evidence at the hearing because in doing so they were functioning as advocates. See Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. 984 (<HOLDING>); see also Butz, 438 U.S. at 516-517, 98 S.Ct. holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from 1983 suits for initiating a prosecution and presenting the case at trialholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding prosecutors immune from civil suits for initiating prosecutions and presenting casesholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\ntrial court entered a summary judgment in favor of the defendant attorneys on the counts premised on the alleged breach of the Disciplinary Rules. In affirming the summary judgment, this Court stated: \u201cThe Alabama courts, state and federal, have never addressed the issue of whether a breach of a Disciplinary Rule under the Code of Professional Responsibility provides the basis for a private cause of action. However, courts in other jurisdictions which have confronted this issue have expressly held that a violation of a Disciplinary Rule does not create a private cause of action. Tew v. Arky, Freed, Stearns, Watson, Greer, Weaver, & Harris, P.A., 655 F.Supp. 1573 (S.D.Fla.1987); Bickel v.

See Walker, supra. Thus, we reject any contention that the trial court lacked any evidence on which to base its finding that the father had failed to properly register the divorce judgment. The father next argues that the trial court, for a variety of reasons, erred in setting aside the 2006 modification judgment; however, the father appealed only the March 28, 2011, judgment, which dismissed only the petition for a rule nisi and the petition to modify the divorce judgment filed on August 6, 2009. We, therefore, cannot consider any arguments addressed toward the propriety of the judgment setting aside the 2006 modification judgment. See Landry v. Landry, 42 So.Sd 755, 757-58 (Ala.Civ.App.2009) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, because the trial court relied holding that the appellate court should have construed the notice of appeal from the denial of a motion to vacate the judgment as an attempt to appeal from the underlying judgmentholding that notice indicating the appeal was from summary judgment order was insufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction to reach appellants challenge to earlier order compelling arbitrationrecognizing that an appellants failure to properly file a notice of appeal as to a particular judgment prevents an appellate court from obtaining jurisdiction to review that judgmentholding that when an appeal is properly taken from an underlying judgment the court of appeals has discretion to review a subsequent order denying a motion to vacateholding the trial court was without authority to dismiss an appeal on the ground that the amount of the judgment required the appellant to file an application for discretionary review & \n\nChief Judge. Arnold Ellis, the appellant, is serving a 12-year prison term as a result of his 1983 conviction for drug offenses. As part of his sentence, the court ordered him to pay a \u201cstand committed\u201d fine of $60,000.

Lawyers who are preparing to leave a law firm face a dilemma, caught between the fiduciary obligations they owe the other members of their firm, on one hand, and the duty of being able to adequately represent clients who choose to follow them to their new place of employment, on the other hand. As a practical matter, then, cases have recognized that some preliminary preparations by lawyers who are leaving a firm must be allowed, and that it is appropriate for lawyers in these circumstances to make arrangements, prior to their departure, to obtain new office space, equipment, and other materials necessary for the practice of law. Bray v. Squires, 702 S.W.2d 266 (Tex. Ct. App. 1985); see also Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 393, Comment e (1958) (<HOLDING>).

Even worse, Sotak did not appeal the dismissal and did not inform his clients their case had been dismissed. In the Wheeler matter, Sotak failed to file the report of first injury within the required timeframe. In the American Built and Ellsworth matters he failed to serve opposing parties within the ninety day parameter set forth in Iowa Rule of Civil Procedure 1.302(5). These cases illustrate Sotak\u2019s consistent failure to perform his assumed obligations. B. Misrepresentation In the Wheeler, American Built, and Ellsworth matters he also made misrepresentations to hide the neglect. Misrepresentation of neglect warrants a more severe sanction. See Iowa Supreme Ct. Bd. of Prof'l Ethics & Conduct v. Walters, 646 N.W.2d 111, 114 (Iowa 2002) (<HOLDING>). The practice of law simply cannot have people holding an attorney is an agent of the client and therefore cannot conspire with the clientholding that an attorney may only undertake to represent a new client against a former client where there is no confidential information received from the former client that is in any way relevant to representation of the current clientholding that suspension for fortyfive days with requirement of paying restitution of 47950 to client plus costs was appropriate disciplinary sanction for attorneys conduct relating to representation of client in divorce action in failing to act with diligence failing to keep client informed failing to adequately explain matters to client and failing to return unearned advancefee upon termination of representation and for attorneys conduct in failing to respond to two letters from office of bar counsel seeking explanation of inconsistencies in attorneys response to bar complaintholding multiple instances of neglecting client matters engaging in misrepresentation failing to notify a client of his suspension from the practice of law and failing to respond to inquiries from the iowa supreme court board of professional ethics and conduct warranted eighteenmonth suspensionholding client is not liable for actions of attorney who misled client as to the status of case & \n\ncancel both the \u201cplain and precise\u201d one-year limitation Congress placed on a former spouse\u2019s right to claim the benefits and the clear prohibition against subjecting an annuity to legal process. Id. (quoting King v. King, 225 Ga. App. 298, 483 S.E.2d 379, 383 (1997)). The Court thus found that the Virginia divorce decree, which would effectively negate this federal one-year limitation, was appropriately overridden by the SBP law because clear and substantial federal interests would \u201csuffer major damage if the state law [were] applied.\u201d Id. at 8, 539 S.E.2d at 725 (quoting Yazell, 382 U.S. at 352). The facts and federal law at issue in the instant case are easily distinguishable on all three of these points. First, FEGLIA does not creat 19 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1137 (C.D. Cal. 1998) (<HOLDING>); Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

The defendants\u2019 reliance on a string of cases holding that municipal attorneys in positions similar to Selkirk\u2019s were not protected by Elrod and Branti, is irrelevant and misplaced. The very essence of the following cases required an examination of the duties of each plaintiff to ascertain whether his position entailed \u201cpolicymak-ing\u201d responsibility or required political fealty to effectively perform. The Court need not undertake such an analysis here because the Defendants have already done so and concluded to the contrary. See Livas v. Petka, 711 F.2d 798 (7th Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); Mummau v.

See, e.g., Federal Rule of Evidence 615. Although that Rule authorizes a district court to sequester witnesses to prevent them from hearing the testimony of other witnesses, it also provides several exceptions, including an exception for \u201ca person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3). The Advisory Committee notes specify that this exception contemplates \u201can expert needed to advise counsel in the management of the litigation.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3) Advisory Committee notes.

Indeed, the \u201cexplanatory statement\u201d prefacing the new Property Registry Facilitation Act indicates that registrar delay has been widespread in Puerto Rico for quite some time without the fault of applicants. See 2010 P.R. Laws No. 216. Moreover, the local statutes give no indication that mere passage of time caused by registrar delay somehow nullifies or expires the filing entry or its priority rank. Cf. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 30, \u00a7 2255 (entry of presentation expires where notified defect is not seasonably corrected). Like the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as the creditor in 229 Main Street, Banco Popular obtained a concrete, pre-petition debt owed to it by the property owner. See 229 Main St., 262 F.3d at 7 (<HOLDING>). Even more than Massachusetts, though, Banco holding that no distinction exists between investigatory costs and onsite cleanup costs for purposes of recoveryholding that the state was not liable as an operator for responding to a site to conduct cleanup activitiesholding that an action by plaintiffs who had a legal obligation to conduct cleanup pursuant to a 106 order and then sought costs for cleanup from other prps was the quintessential action for contributionholding that debtor was liable to the commonwealth for past and future cleanup costsholding that the department of transportation was liable under the mtca but that it was not responsible for any of the cleanup costs & \n\nresult from improper performance of the employee\u2019s duties.\u201d Martin, 381 F.3d at 583. Plaintiffs contend that underwriters do not exercise discretion and independent judgment concerning matters of significance because the underwriters do not bear any responsibility for financial loss and do not determine the financial risk that Huntington will take for any given loan. However, while underwriters do not determine Huntington\u2019s overall risk guidelines, they still make decisions that signifi cantly impact the business and do determine the risk Huntington will accept for any particular loan. Underwriters can approve loans between $250,000 and $1,000,000. Their approval of a loan binds Huntington to that risk, and their denial of an application prevents a customer from acquiring credit. Cf (<HOLDING>). Therefore, Huntington\u2019s underwriters satisfy holding that the analogous predecessor regulation to 29 cfr 541202a did not encompass an employee who made no decisions that affect even the small segment of the companys operations in which his work is performedholding that the fact that the insurance agents perform functions that are an essential part of the companys normal operations is a decisive factorholding that an employer is accountable to a discharged employee for unpaid compensation if the employee was terminated in bad faith and the compensation is clearly connected to work already performedholding futa after which florida molded its unemployment law is phrased entirely in terms of the nature of the employer and not in terms of the work performed or the place at which the employee worksholding that your work exclusion is triggered only where the damage at issue is to work performed by you and is caused by work performed by you and does not apply to damage caused to original construction of a house during later repair work & \n\ncomplaint has been filed and, as such, there is no civil action. Ms. Shepard cites to a number of cases in her brief which support the longstanding rule in North Carolina that the Clerk of Superior Court has original jurisdiction in an estate matter, while the Superior Court Judge has derivative jurisdiction. See, e.g., In re Estate of Parrish, 143 N.C. App. 244, 251, 547 S.E.2d 74, 78 (noting that the estate proceeding at issue \u201cwas not a civil action, but a proceeding concerning an estate matter, which was exclusively within the purview of the Clerk\u2019s jurisdiction, and over which the Superior Court retained appellate, not original, jurisdiction.\u201d) (citations omitted), disc. review denied, 354 N.C. 69, 553 S.E.2d 201 (2001); In re Green, 9 N.C.

We hold that there was sufficient evidence holding that evidence tending to show knowing participation in the conspiracy is sufficient to sustain conspiracy convictionholding that the evidence did not plausibly support a buyerseller instruction because overwhelming evidence showed that defendants agreed to import drugs with the intent to distribute them and engaged in repeated transactions of large quantities of narcotic drugs for resaleholding in part that awareness of resale activities together with evidence of kickback relationship is sufficient to support conviction for conspiracy to distributeholding no unfair prejudice from admission of conviction for possession of 50 to 200 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute as evidence of intent to distribute cocaineholding that circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to support a cocaine conspiracy conviction & \n\nthe structure of drug trafficking organizations and the role of drug couriers. Cira testified that a drug distributor would not have allowed the quantity of drugs in this case out of his control, and that, in his experience, he had never encountered a courier who did not know what was in his vehicle. Martinez never objected to the admission of Cira\u2019s testimony in district court. Therefore, we review this claim for plain error. See United States v. Jones, 266 F.3d 804, 814 (8th Cir.2001). Relying on Ninth Circuit precedent, Martinez contends admission of the testimony was error because he was not charged with conspiracy to import drugs and no evidence was presented to link him to an actual drug trafficking organization. See United States v. Vallejo, 237 F.3d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Martinez also contends admission of the holding that expert testimony concerning the structure of drug trafficking organizations is inadmissible where the defendant is not charged with a conspiracy to import drugs or where such evidence is not otherwise probative of a matter properly before the courtholding a fiveyear old drug conviction is probative of a defendants state of mind in a drug conspiracy caseholding that the district court committed prejudicial error in admitting expert testimony about the structure of drug trafficking organizations because the testimony portrayed the defendant as a member of such an organization and implied the defendant knew the drugs were in his vehicleholding that expert testimony regarding the structure of drug trafficking organizations was inadmissible in a nonconspiracy importation caseholding that the district court complied with the requirements of lb13alb where it made specific references to testimony in the record relating to the scope of the defendants involvement in the drug trafficking conspiracy noted that the relevant testimony was unrefuted and stated that the testimony was internally consistent & \n\nboat. All six (Martinez-Rios, Ramirez-Fajardo, Castaneda-Marin, Sanchez-Martinez, Ortiz-Cotoa and Carmargo-Silvera) were charged with conspiracy to possess and with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a) and 1903(j), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Carmargo-Silv-era pled guilty and testified on behalf of the government. The remaining five went to trial and were convicted. Discussion Defendants claim the district court erred by deciding, as a matter of law, that the MS was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as required by 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a). Defendants claim that jurisdiction is an element of the offense and should have been submitted for determination by the jury. See U.S. v. Ayarza-Garcia, 819 F.2d 1043, 1048-49 (11th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). Defendants claim they objected to the holding that claim construction is an issue of law for the court not a question of fact for the juryholding that generally the question of waiver and estoppel is a question of factrecognizing that under district of columbia law what the parties deem to be the material elements of their agreement either set forth in or absent from those documents is largely a question of fact for the jury and concluding in that case that whether an enforceable oral contract was created and was subsequently breached is a question of fact for the jury to decide not this courtholding it is a question of factholding under predecessor to 46 usc app 1903a that jurisdictional element of crime is question of fact for jury to decide & \n\nAlan Pardofigueroa appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and 27-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction to Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Fraud and Misuse of Documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), and False Statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Pardofigueroa also contends that the district holding guidelines to be only advisoryholding that the preponderance standard is generally appropriate in guidelines sentencingrecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standardholding that the district court determines the amount of loss under the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that under the advisory guidelines a district court should resolve factual disputes at sentencing by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\nAlthough public policy arguments are not resolved by juries, they require that the court understand what happened to a plaintiff, a question only answered after a. judge has heard evidence detailing the circumstances that resulted in an injury. See Lodge, 246 Conn. at 578, 717 A.2d 215 (resolving public policy question after trial); Jaworski, 241 Conn. at 408, 696 A.2d 332 (same). To address public policy for the first time at this stage in the litigation deprives the Munns of the opportunity to rebut Hotch-kiss\u2019s version of events. How, for example, could the Munns have known that they needed to offer evidence of \u201cthe normal expectations of the participants in the activity under review\u201d? Even if Hotchkiss had adequately preserved its argument, however, it should not be excused from (<HOLDING>). There is no public policy exemption holding that the proceeds of a liability insurance policy were not property of the estateholding that new yorks public policy does not bar insurance coverage for disparate impact employment discrimination but noting that the state of new york insurance department has stated that it is against public policy to provide insurance coverage for intentional acts of discriminationholding first that tortfeasor could have foreseen that victims employers insurance premiums might increase and then deciding that public policy precluded liability for those increasesholding first that injuries sustained during contact sports were foreseeable then deciding that public policy insulated the defendant from liability for those injuriesholding that a standard employers liability policy is not an ocean marine policy & \n\nevidence of these matters is not required to sustain a conviction. Indeed, the \u201caffirmative links\u201d analysis is a way \u201cto explain why the circumstantial evidence in a particular case [is] sufficient for conviction.\u201d Brown, 911 S.W.2d at 747. In addition, the trial court, as trier of fact, was the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and could have disbelieved the defense witnesses\u2019 testimony that others had used Wiley\u2019s car. See Dewberry, 4 S.W.3d at 740. In such a case, there would be no basis for considering Wiley\u2019s possession of the car to be shared with others. Wiley also relies on Miller v. State, 627 S.W.2d 235, 237 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1981, pet. ref'd), for the proposition that evidence that the defendant possessed keys to pp.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. ref'd) (<HOLDING>); Lassaint v. State, 79 S.W.3d 736, 741-46 holding that there was insufficient evidence to establish that defendant had knowledge of firearm in close proximity to him when he was driving the car for the cars owner who was a passengerholding evidence that showed only that defendant drove car in which cocaine was found was insufficient to connect him to it especially in light of his attempts to dissociate himself from passenger who was high and in possession of pop at time of arrestholding evidence did not connect defendant to narcotics found in individual bags inside a larger bag in a car following the defendants car when the only connection was his fingerprints on outer bag and when the driver and passenger of the car in which the drugs were found exhibited nervousness and other factors indicating consciousness of guiltholding that defendant who was a passenger in a car had joint constructive possession of drugs found next to the defendants luggage in truck of car even where she disclaimed ownership of the drugsholding that evidence was insufficient to prove constructive possession where the defendant was in jail at the time the drugs were seized from his residence & \n\nIf the defendant perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law is satisfied, and only if the defendant is aware that his death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing. Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it. See Garrett v. Collins, 951 F.2d 57, 59 (5th Cir.1992) and Lowenfield v. Butler, 843 F.2d 183, 187 (5th Cir.1988) (both quoting and relying on this excerpt from Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in Ford, 477 U.S. at 422, 106 S.Ct. 2595 (Powell, J., concurring), in denying competency-to-be-executed habeas relief); see also Fearance, 56 F.3d at 640 and Barnard, 13 F.3d at 876 n. 2 (<HOLDING>).

Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 520 (1977); Leatherwood, 121 S.W.3d at 699-700 (citing Restatement factors). The application of strict liability for ul-trahazardous activities appears to be rather limited in Tennessee, as it is in other jurisdictions. See, e.g., Ergon, Inc. v. Amoco Oil Co., 966 F.Supp. 577, 583 (W.D.Tenn.1997) (noting that Tennessee courts reject the application of strict liability to gas suppliers for escaping gas, even though gas is poisonous, dangerous, and highly explosive, and holding that defendants with escaping petroleum products also should not merit strict liability). But see Sterling v. Velsicol Chem. Corp., 647 F.Supp. 303, 315-16 (W.D.Tenn.1986) (<HOLDING>), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 855 F.2d 1188 holding that under facts presented defendants creation location operation and closure of toxic chemical dump was abnormally dangerous and ultrahazardous activityholding in a case involving denial of coverage under an insurance contract that the location of documentary evidence related to insurance coverage mattered less than the location of the underlying tort suitsholding other than location of the drugs state presented evidence establishing direct connection between drugs and accused thereby creating inference of controlholding that an anonymous tip that described a suspects appearance and location and alleged that he was carrying a concealed weapon was insufficiently corroborated by the officers observation of the appellant who matched the description hanging out at the indicated locationholding that an officer must be able to point to particular facts from which he reasonably inferred that the individual was armed and dangerous & \n\nRule 29(c)). 9 . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) states, in relevant part; It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 10 .It is not clear whether the government attempted to demonstrate that the pistol and rifle were acquired separately and at different times or places. If they did not make such a showing, the indictment under which Alanis was charged would be duplicitous under our recent holding in United States v. Buchmeier, 255 F.3d 415, 422 (7th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The defense did not challenge the indictment holding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involvedholding that when the indictment charges that a certain minimum quantity of drugs is involved in the offense proof of that quantity is a fourth element of the offenseholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that the quantity of drugs involved in an offense does not support a downward departure because the legislature intended the quantity of drugs to be a determining factor in varying penaltiesholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that count & \n\nin the corresponding psychiatric evaluation.\u201d McRae I, 139 N.C. App. at 391,394, 533 S.E.2d at 560, 562. In this case, defendant\u2019s competence has never been assessed, let alone at a relevant time. Thus, it is clear that a retrospective determination of defendant\u2019s competence would not be possible here and we do not need to remand for the trial court to make such a determination. Because defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial has never been evaluated and \u201c[g]iven the inherent difficulties of such a nunc pro tunc determination under the most favorable circumstances, we cannot conclude that such a procedure would be adequate here.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 183, 43 L.Ed. 2d at 119-20 (citations omitted); see also Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 403, 4 L.Ed. 2d 824, 825 (1960) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s holding that appellant must present some evidence of a subsequent change in competency or some new evidence in a manner analogous to newly discovered evidence in a motion for new trial to complain of a denial of a second competency hearingrecognizing the difficulty of retrospectively determining the defendants competency as of more than a year ago and ordering a new trial and hearing as to the defendants present competenceholding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the state does not have to prove a defendants competency to stand trialholding that a trial court must conduct sua sponte a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendants competence & \n\npersons affected.\u201d State v. Breed, 111 Idaho 497, 500, 725 P.2d 202, 205 (Ct.App.1986). In any equal protection analysis, the court must: first, identify the classification that is being challenged; second, articulate the standard under which the classification will be tested; and third, determine whether the standard has been satisfied. Id. at 500, 725 P.2d at 205. Accordingly, in order for Rome to prevail, he is required to show that he, by virtue of some classification, was treated differently than a person who does not share that classification, However, I.C. \u00a7 18-1401 does not create a classification. The statute applies to \u201cevery person\u201d who enters a building with the intent to commit any theft or felony. See State v. Hamlin, 156 Idaho 307, 316, 324 P.3d 1006, 1015 (Ct.App.2014) (<HOLDING>). It is true, as Rome points out, that Idaho holding that statute which defined sexual contact as any touching of the anus breast or any part of the genitals of another person with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person was not vagueholding that a statute applied to any person who sexually abused and exploited a vulnerable adult and did not treat the defendant differently on account of any classificationholding that language in a merrill lynch customer account agreement that the plaintiff signed upon opening the first account providing for arbitration of any controversy arising out of its business applied to the disputed second account even though the plaintiff did not sign a separate customer account agreement for the second accountholding that the plaintiff who alleged he was subjected to discipline and a disciplinary proceeding not applicable to any other police officer under the collective bargaining agreement but not alleging any classbased discrimination failed to state a claim as the plaintiff did not show how he was treated differently from others similarly situated emphasis addedholding with no analysis that any person or organization who may be legally liable therefor applies to a person legally liable for injuries caused by an accident 4 when under the facts of the case the only person to whom the clause could have applied was a tortfeasor & \n\nresponded by commenting on his state of inebriation). That Goulet mentioned the connection between the drugs and the money and indicated that there was other evidence tying the defendant to the drugs did not turn his explanations of administrative and other routine matters into the functional equivalent of interrogation. See Spencer, 149 N.H. at 625-26 (showing defendant bank surveillance photographs in response to defendant\u2019s claims of innocence and repeated questions about the basis for her arrest was not the functional equivalent of interrogation). Similarly, Goulet\u2019s responses to the defendant\u2019s direct questions about what the police were going to do with him and about the bail process did not constitute interrogation or its functional equivalent. See Gribble, 165 N.H. at 12 (<HOLDING>); Briggs, 273 F.3d at 740-41 (holding police holding that leaning towards the death penalty is not the same as an automatic vote for the death penaltyholding that the district court did not err in admitting evidence of an allegedly coerced interrogation where the taped interrogation was played for jurors and the defendant crossexamined the witness at length about the interrogationholding that an officer engaged in the functional equivalent of interrogation when he asked a suspect to identify clothing found at a crime scene after the suspect was in custody and had invoked his right to silence regardless of the officers intentionsholding it was not the functional equivalent of interrogation when police officer answered defendants questions about his job the death penalty or murder charges in generalholding that the death penalty is unconstitutional as applied to juvenile defendants & \n\nlitigation because, for example, relevant business documents pertaining to the antitrust conspiracy may not exist and covert behavior may have to be proven through less direct means.\u201d); Callahan v.

Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\ncourt made individualized determinations for each defendant, this argument overlooks the fact that the court neglected to identify the particular evidence presented at trial and at the sentencing hearing that led it to find Orlando accountable for $449,000.

However, the Kansas Act does not provide a private cause of action. For these reasons, defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is granted. A. The Kentucky Act (Count Two) \u201cERISA comprehensively regulates, among es insurance\u201d under the new legal standard announced by the Supreme Court in Miller. However, while Miller announced a new legal standard for determining whether a state law regulates insurance for purposes of ERISA\u2019s savings clause, Miller involved an \u201cany willing provider\u201d statute, not a state judicial remedy for a claims processing cause of action. Thus, Miller did not modify the body of case law regarding so-called \u201cconflict preemption\u201d in which a state law adds to the judicial remedies available under ERISA. See Elliot, 337 F.3d at 1147 (<HOLDING>); see also, e.g., Nguyen v.

Indeed, Sheehan\u2019s own expert acknowledged that there was tape around the device that could have been used to attach one of the wires from the pipe to the .top of the battery. The language in Posnjak on which.Sheehan relies makes sense when read to require that a \u201ccombination of parts\u201d cannot be considered a destructive device based on the hypothetical possibility that the parts could be \u201creadily\u201d made into a bomb only if the defendant could obtain some crucial component that he did not possess and could not acquire without. a \u201cshopping trip.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Malone, 546 F.2d 1182, 1184 (5th Cir. 1977) (<HOLDING>). Posn-jak cannot sensibly be read to require holding that the defendant could not be convicted for possessing a combination of parts that could be readily assembled into a bomb where the defendant did not possess any explosive material a key element required for the creation of a bombholding the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement where guns were found on the same premises from which the defendant trafficked drugs and were readily accessible to the defendantholding that jurys verdict for the defendant in a breach of contract action did not establish the absence of breach because the jury was instructed that it could find for the defendant if it concluded that the defendant had not breached the contract or if the defendant proved an affirmative defenseholding that a reasonable jury could find the device to be readily convertible into an explosive bomb where wires could be quickly stripped and recrimped to a pager that was part of the detonating mechanismholding that evidence of a defendants prior criminal convictions could be introduced for the purpose of sentence enhancement if the jury was instructed that the evidence could not be used for the purposes of determining guilt & \n\ndeclined to provide a breath sample. At some point during or after the booking process, appellant complained of chest and wrist pain, so the police called for an ambulance. The trial court found appellant guilty of DWI, and this appeal followed. Sufficiency of the Evidence In his sole issue, appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his DWI conviction. A. Standard of Review When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational fact finder could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); Adames v. State, 353 S.W.3d 854, 859 (Tex.Crim.App.2011) (<HOLDING>). Our review of \u201call of the evidence\u201d includes holding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that appellate court could not review the sufficiency of the evidence based on a particular legal standard because that standard was not submitted to the jury and no party objected to the charge on this ground or requested that the jury be charged using this standardholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdictholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\nconsidered by the jury in its sentencing deliberations, this same evidence was also sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances concerning the commission of rape during the murders. See Berryhill v. State, 249 Ga. 442, 450-451 (11) (291 SE2d 685) (1982) (noting that the jury properly reconsiders all of the evidence from the guilt\/innocence phase in the sentencing phase). This same standard, which concerns the sufficiency of the evidence when reviewed on appeal, applies to Martin\u2019s claim here, which is essentially a claim that the trial court erred by not granting a directed verdict regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance at issue. See Miller v. State, 270 Ga. 741, 742 (1) (512 SE2d 272) (1999) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that the standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as the standard for a motion to dismissholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdict & \n\n"}

Karlton held in holding that no judgment can be rendered against defendant who cannot be held liableholding that public entities may be held vicariously hable for the negligent acts of their individual employeesholding principal liable to third party for tort of agent despite lack of privity between principal and third partyholding despite defendants claim that it could not be held hable for infringing acts of thirdparties that defendant could be held liable for foreign third partys infringement if it knew or should have known that third party maru fungs copies of ms metzkes designs would be distributed by nonmay retailers in the united statesholding that the individual defendant does not have to be in privity of contract with the plaintiff to be held liable under 1981 & \n\nof the claims of fraud against BMC because it allegedly committed the fraud as BMC\u2019s agent. If Plaintiffs are unable to show fraud on the part of BMC or First Boston, as BMC\u2019s agent, BMC will have no claim for contribution or indemnity against First Boston. If Plaintiffs are able to show fraud on the part of First Boston, it might be held liable for all or part of the claim against BMC, even though it would not be liable for the particular relief sought. The power to implead First Boston based on its fraud as an agent of BMC should not be limited by the form of the remedy requested in the Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint, especially when, as here, the relief sought is a lump sum of $30,000,000 minus the value of the Notes. Cf. Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Concast, Inc., 99 F.R.D. 566 (S.D.N.Y.1983) (<HOLDING>). Although no authority is presented for the holding that where the question to be resolved in the declaratory judgment action will be decided in a pending action it is inappropriate to grant a declaratory judgmentholding that the declaratory judgment act is remedial only and the party seeking declaratory relief must have an underlying cause of actionholding thirdparty complaint proper in action for declaratory judgment even though the defendant would have no pecuniary liability to plaintiffsholding that if a declaratory judgment will not end the controversy it is not properholding that filing of infringement action twelve days after complaint for declaratory judgment obviated the need for a declaratory judgment in this case & \n\nstatements made to investment analysts.

Xoma Corp., 74 F.3d 955, 959 (9th Cir.1996). See also McGann v.

Accordingly, a trial court has the authority to impose sanctions on a party that perpetrates a fraud on the court, which includes striking that party\u2019s pleadings and entering a. default judgment against that party. See Faddis, 121 So.3d at 1135. However, and importantly for our purposes, the power of the court to impose sanctions under these circumstances \u201cshould be exercised with .great restraint\u201d and should be used \u2018\u201conly upon the most blatant showing of fraud, pretense, collusion, or other similar wrongdoing.\u2019 \u201d E.I.

While a construction of the statute to impose individual liability on an agent is facially plausible, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of this agent provision was to incorporate respondeat superior liability into the statute.\u201d Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s Int'l Inc., 991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir.1993) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while a supervisory employee may be joined as a party defendant in a Title VII action, that employee must be viewed as being sued in his capacity as the agent of the employer, who is alone hable for a violation of Title VII. See Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>).

Under this theory of direct liability, the City can be held liable for its own negligence or recklessness, but not for the conduct of its supervisors or employees. In contrast, an employer is indirectly, or vicariously, liable for the wrongful conduct of its agent, whether or not the employer knew or should have known about the agent\u2019s 6-07 (4th Cir.1989), vacated in part, 900 F.2d 27 (4th Cir.1990)(<HOLDING>); Hicks v.

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements. Given that role, Stern had a duty to disclose any known information necessary to prevent the Official Statements from being false or misleading. See Howard, 228 F.3d at 1061 (<HOLDING>). Allstate has further alleged that Stern holding a defendant may be convicted of mail fraud if he knowingly and willfully participates in a fraudulent scheme created and set in motion by othersholding that no judgment can be rendered against defendant who cannot be held liableholding that a person violates the bank fraud statute when he knowingly executes a scheme to obtain money from a financial institution by means of false or fraudulent representations if a defendant knowingly provided materially false information in order to induce the loan the crime is complete and it is irrelevant whether or not he intended to repay or was capable of repaying itholding that a defendant can be held liable when it knowingly participates in the creation of a false or misleading statementholding that the elements of a claim under 3729a2 are 1 that the defendant made used or caused to be made or used a record or statement to get a claim against the united states paid or approved 2 the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent and 3 the defendant knew that the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent emphasis added & \n\nliable for this deprivation of Gross\u2019 constitutional rights. \u201cLiability may be imposed under \u00a7 1983 upon one who has a duty to act to prevent a deprivation of another\u2019s constitutional rights, and who fails to do so in reckless disregard of the other\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Hathaway v. Stone, 687 F.Supp. 708, 712 (D.Mass.1988) (citing Clark v. Taylor, 710 F.2d 4, 9 (1st Cir. 1983). \u201cThus courts have held that a police officer who fails to prevent the use in his presence of excessive force by another may be held liable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d Id. at 712 (citing Byrd v. Brishke, 466 F.2d 6 (7th Cir.1972); see Bruner v. Dunaway, 684 F.2d 422, 426 (6th Cir.1982); Bibbo v. Mulhern, 621 F.Supp. 1018, 1025 (D.Mass. 1985)); see also, Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 560 (1st Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiffs allege that the defendant recognizing affirmative duty of a police officer to prevent the violation of constitutional rights by another officerholding that an alcoholic beverage control officer was a public officer within the meaning of the statuteholding officer liable for deprivation of constitutional rights despite argument that officer although present was not in control of the situationholding that although jury found officer not to have had probable cause for arrest officer was entitled to immunity because law was not clearly established as to circumstances in which officer found himselfholding that the initial stop by officer was based on reasonable suspicion that defendant was impersonating a police officer although another officer arrested defendant for privacy act violation & \n\nfunds that is required for the imposition of the statutory trust. Cucinotti next contends that the trial court erred in holding him personally liable. He points out that Reliance rested its theory of personal liability on several grounds, each of which was essentially abandoned in favor of the participation theory as articulated by the Supreme Court in its decision in Saltiel v. GSI Consultants, Inc., 170 N.J. 297, 788 A.2d 268 (2002), a decision released while the Reliance summary judgment motion was pending. While there are other reported decisions that hold that corporate officers who participate in fraud or conversion can be held personally liable for the losses occasioned thereby, see, e.g., Charles Bloom & Co. v. Echo Jewelers, 279 N.J.Super. 372, 382, 652 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.l995)(<HOLDING>); Robsac Indus., Inc. v. Chartpak, 204 holding defendants personally liable for alleged conversion even when acting in corporate capacityholding that a state officer sued in his individual capacity may be held personally liable for damages under 42 usc 1983 based upon actions taken in his official capacityholding that a corporate officer signing a contract in his corporate capacity is generally not liable for damages under the contractholding that the plaintiffs were entitled to discovery to determine whether the defendant intended to be bound in his personal andor corporate capacity where the agreement contained certain personal guarantees by the defendant but where the defendant signed the agreement only in a corporate capacity with no signature blocks provided for signing in a personally capacityholding that state officials may be personally liable for actions taken in their official capacity & \n\nto be paid and which are not, and when.\u201d Id. at 757. As stated in Anderson: A person need not be an officer, director, employee, or shareholder of a company to be held accountable as a responsible person. The test is whether the person had control of the disbursements of the taxpayer, that is, whether \u2018he had the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid, and when.\u2019 It is not necessary that such control be exercised exclusively by the person; it may be exercised jointly with others. Id., 561 F.2d at 165 (citations omitted; emphasis added). In the cases where third party lenders have been held hable under \u00a7 6672, the lender has exercised control over the disbursements of the taxpayer. See Commonwealth National Bank of Dallas v. United States, 665 F.2d 743 (5th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>); Merchants National Bank of Mobile v. United holding successor national bank liable for punitive damages judgment against bank that merged into successor national bankholding the bank liable where the bank had almost complete control over the operation of the company during its last three quarters of operation and where withheld taxes were not paid to the irs on instructions from the bankholding a bank officer who informed a third party that it would be safe to extend 8000 credit to bank customer although customer did not have an open account at the bank could be held liable for the material misrepresentationholding a bank liable where a bank officer held checks that were intended to pay the irs for withheld taxesholding that a bank customer did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in records maintained by the bank & \n\nwe hold that it is not subject to an assertion of equitable estop-pel. As its name implies, equitable es-toppel embraces the notion that a party should not be permitted to profit by asserting rights against another when that party\u2019s own inequitable conduct has lulled the other into action or inaction detrimental to its position. See Fla. Dep\u2019t of Health & Rehab. Servs. v. S.A.P., 835 So.2d 1091, 1096-97 (Fla.2002) (citing State ex rel. Watson v. Gray, 48 So.2d 84, 87-88 (Fla.1950)). The doctrine has been most commonly held to preclude a defendant from raising a statute of limitations defense when the defendant\u2019s false representations mislead the plaintiff into failing to file suit within the limitations period. See Major League Baseball v. Morsani, 790 So.2d 1071, 1076 (Fla.2001) (<HOLDING>); Rinker Materials Corp. v. Palmer First Nat'l holding that the timely filing of a discrimination charge with the equal employment opportunity commission is a requirement like a statute of limitations that is subject to waiver estoppel and equitable tollingrecognizing cause of action for equitable estoppel under erisaholding that defendants may be estopped from raising defense of statute of limitations even though equitable estoppel is not listed in fla stat 95051holding that equitable estoppel may bar a partys assertion of a statute of limitationsholding an evidentiary hearing on the applicability of equitable estoppel & \n\nthe Agreement as he had promised; instead, Husband retained the document for nearly six months, during which time the parties were attempting to reconcile their marriage, and produced it for enforcement when Wife finally sought a divorce. This evidence \u2014 the prolonged retention of the Agreement that Husband promised to destroy as soon as Wife signed it, coupled with the subsequent attempt to enforce it \u2014 though slight, is sufficient to establish the existence of fraud, especially here, in light of the relationship between the parties and the nature of the Agreement. OCGA \u00a7 23-2-57 (\u201cFraud may not be presumed but, being in itself subtle, slight circumstances may be sufficient to carry conviction of its existence.\u201d). Cf. Horton v. Johnson, 192 Ga. 338, 346-347 (1) (15 SE2d 605) (1941) (<HOLDING>). Based on the foregoing, the trial court did holding that parol evidence is admissible to establish a condition precedent to the existence of a contractholding that the burden is on defendant as the party invoking removal jurisdiction to establish the existence of a sufficient amount in controversyholding that the nonmovant must make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that partys caserecognizing that slight evidence of fraud is sufficient to establish its existence particularly involving family transactionsholding that evidence must be sufficient to establish elements of professional negligence particularly causation and damages arising from attorneys claimed failure to properly defend plaintiff & \n\nheld that Prostok\u2019s claims do not collaterally attack the confirmation order because they are based on conduct extrinsic to the confirmation order. 112 S.W.3d 876, 905. This Court has held that when a party does not seek to set aside a prior judgment, but instead brings suit based on extrinsic fraud, the action is not a collateral attack. State v. Durham, 860 S.W.2d 63, 67 (Tex.1993) (recognizing, in a suit brought by the state for fraud in obtaining court approval for an oil and gas lease, that the State had not sought to set aside the judgment but had \u201calleged fraud extrinsic to the judgment, and invoke[d] the equity powers of the court to impose a constructive trust\u201d); cf. Spera v. Fleming, Hovenkamp & Grayson, P.C., 25 S.W.3d 863, 871 (Tex.App.\u2014 Houston [14th DistJ 2000, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). In contrast, the underlying issues resolved holding that debtors have no right to jury trial on malpractice claims against their attorneysholding that extrinsic conduct that formed the basis of claims for attorney malpractice and breach of fiduciary duty were not a collateral attack on trial courts order apportioning attorneys feesholding breach of fiduciary duty claim is essentially a negligence or professional malpractice claimholding that there would be no exception to american rule on attorney fees for legal malpractice claimsholding that attorneys fees and costs expended as a result of an attorneys alleged malpractice constitute legallycognizable damages for purposes of stating a claim for such malpractice & \n\ninto at Plaintiffs urging. Lastly, Plaintiff does not allege, nor do the facts suggests the existence of fraud or undue influence at the time the Agreement was drafted and signed. After considering all the relevant factors, this Court concludes that the forum selection clause agreed to by the parties is reasonable and appropriate in this particular matter. Therefore, under Bremen, and its more local progeny, this Court holds that, pursuant to the Agreement, proper venue for resolution of this matter is in Salt Lake City, Utah. TRANSFER As noted above, having upheld the forum selection clause, this Court finds that in the interest of justice transfer of this matter to Utah pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406(a) is most appropriate. Janko v. Outboard Marine Corp., 605 F.Supp. 51 (W.D.Okla.l985)(<HOLDING>), See also Hoffman v. Burroughs Corp., 571 holding that a forum selection clause should control absent a strong showing that it be set aside as unreasonable unjust or invalidholding that a forum selection clause should not be enforced where a consumer is told by a corporate agent to ignore boilerplate contract language containing a forum selection clause where there is a material difference in bargaining power and where the forum designated by the contract has little to do with the transaction and is gravely inconvenient for the parties and witnessesholding that corporations owned and controlled by the party signing the contract containing the forum selection clause may be bound by the clauseholding that when action arising under contract containing venue selection clause is filed in court other than that specified in clause case will be transferred to forum selected by contract unless venue selection clause is unreasonable and unjust or invalid due to fraud or overreachingholding that a forum selection clause was not enforceable against defendants that were not parties to the contract & \n\nVII because the action of the Sheriff\u2019s Office interfered with his employment opportunities with third party employers. Because defendants moved for summary judgment only on the question of the employment relationship between plaintiff and defendants, it is not necessary for us to decide the viability of this theory. We note, however, that the Fifth Circuit apparently has not resolved the question of whether an \u201cemployer\u201d as defined by Title VII, can be liable under Title VII for interference with a plaintiff's employment opportunities with a third party. See Diggs v. Harris Hospital-Methodist, Inc., 847 F.2d 270, 272 & n. 2 (5th Cir.1988); Daniels v. Allied Elec. Contractors Inc., 847 F.Supp. 514 (E.D.Tex.1994). See also Sibley Memorial Hosp. v. Wilson, 488 F.2d 1338 (D.C.Cir.1973) (<HOLDING>). 4 . The instant motion was based solely on holding that a title vii plaintiff could not hold coworkers liable in their individual capacities under title viiholding that such a theory is viable under title viiholding the title vii mixedmotive theory does not apply to adea claimsholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that there is no individual liability under title vii & \n\nwith other free individuals \u2014 was unknown through much of history and is unknown even today in many parts of the world. Like other aspects of personal autonomy, it is too easily smothered by government officials eager to tell us what\u2019s best for us. The recent tendency of judges to insinuate tort causes of action into relationships traditionally governed by contract is just such overreaching. It must be viewed with no less suspicion because the government officials in question happen to wear robes. Ill Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning. The California Supreme Court is once again leading the way. Foley v. Interactive Data Corp., 47 Cal.3d 654, 765 P.2d 373, 254 Cal.Rptr. 211 (1988), has taken a bite out of Seaman\u2019s by holding that tort remedies are 805, 195 Cal.Rptr. 421 (1983) (<HOLDING>). At long last, however, we seem to be moving holding that plaintiffs unjust enrichment claim was predicated on tort and that it was therefore subject to the statute of limitations for tort actionsholding the government liable to plaintiffs for breach of contractholding that there must be a tort distinguishable from or independent of the breach of contract in order for a party to bring a valid claim in tort based on a breach in a contractual relationshiprecognizing that there can be compelling circumstances in which a trial court can determine that neither party prevailed in a contract caseholding that a party can be liable in tort for actions authorized by the contract & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\nwas transferred back to DCXOM because Defendants wanted to get rid of him. 1. Individual Liability Wilson alleges claims of race discrimination pursuant to Title VII, the ELCRA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against Budco and Raymond. As Wilson conceded during a hearing on the motion, an individual who does not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d is not subject to individual liability under Title VII. Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe now hold that an individual employee\/supervisor, who does not otherwise qualify as an \u2018employer\u2019 may not be held personally liable under Title VIL\u201d). Individual liability may, however, be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 1981 and the ELCRA. See Whidbee v.

Similarly, introduction of a warrant of deportation does not violate the Confrontation Clause. United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, 411 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the district court did not err in holding that letters addressing dispute that was subject of litigation and that were written in anticipation of litigation did not fall under business record exception under rule 8036 of the federal rules of evidence and noting that it is wellestablished that one who prepares a document in anticipation of litigation is not acting in the regular course of businessholding that it is notholding that not all of claims file was prepared in anticipation of litigation and noting that the majority of cases that have dealt with the issue of whether investigative materials prepared by insurance claims adjusters is workproduct prepared in anticipation of litigation have held that since insurance companies have a routine duty to investigate accidents such materials are not prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that driving record is nontestimonial as it is not accusatory and does not describe specific criminal wrongdoing of the defendant it contains no expression of opinion or conclusion requiring the exercise of discretion and it merely represents the objective result of a public records searchholding a warrant of deportation nontestimonial because it was not made in anticipation of litigation and because it is simply a routine objective cataloging of an unambiguous factual matter & \n\nRoberts but before Crawford, the Supreme Court expressly relied on Roberts. The Court reasoned that \u201cthe co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule [Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) ] is firmly enough rooted in our jurisprudence that, under this Court\u2019s holding in Roberts, a court need not inde1 pendently inquire into the reliability of such statements.\u201d Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 183, 107 S.Ct. 2775. Brist is therefore correct that the Court has rejected Bour-jaily\u2019s underlying reasoning by now requiring courts to conduct a separate Confrontation Clause analysis for out-of-court \u201ctestimonial\u201d statements, even when the statements at issue otherwise satisfy a firmly-rooted hearsay exception. See, e.g., Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2540, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) (<HOLDING>); Davis v.

The record reflects, and the State acknowledges, that appellant is not a United States citizen. B. Knowledge of Immigration Consequences Before examining the strength of the evidence of the appellant\u2019s guilt, we must examine the record for any indication that the defendant knew the consequences of his guilty plea. VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 713 (stating that the strength or weakness of the evidence against the appellant makes little difference to the harm analysis if the second factor above is not satisfied). To warrant reversal, the record must support an inference that the defendant did not know the consequences of his plea. Burnett, .-Dallas 2004, pet. ref'd) (<HOLDING>).

Chrzanowski, 502 F.2d 573 (3d Cir. 1974) (\u201cThe proper function and purpose of rebuttal testimony is to explain, repel, counteract or disprove the evidence of the adverse party.\u201d).

Wilcox, 21 S.D. 532, 114 N.W. 687 (1908) (emphasis added). [\u00b6 17.] Crawford cites Washington v. Texas in support of his argument that his right to compulsory process was violated. 388 U.S. 14, 23, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 1925, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967). In Washington, the United States Supreme Court decided the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process was denied because the State arbitrarily denied him the right to have a witness testify who had relevant and material testimony. Id. See United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, 458 U.S. 858, 872-73, 102 S.Ct. 3440, 3449-50, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) (the government may not deport witnesses who have material and relevant testimony); Fountaine v. State, 460 So.2d 553, 555 (Fla.App.2d Dist.1984) (<HOLDING>), petition for review denied, 464 So.2d 554 holding that the defendants due process rights were violated when the trial judge singled out the only defense witness and indicated to that witness that he expected the witness to he and would personally ensure that the witness was prosecuted for perjury and thereby effectively drove that witness off the standholding that despite district courts restriction on crossexamination of government witness concerning the sentencing benefits he would earn through testifying for the government it did not violate defendants confrontation rights because of defense counsels effective impeachment of the government witnesses credibility and sentence reductionrecognizing that informing the jury that testifying witness has agreed to cooperate with the government is a doubleedged sword as the existence of such agreement may suggest either that the witness will testify in accordance with the governments wishes regardless of the truth or that the witness will not he under threat of revocation of the agreement should the witness commit perjuryrecognizing the right to compulsory process only requires that the government may not prevent an otherwise willing defense witness from testifyingholding that evidence of a threat to a witness by the defendant is relevant as showing an attempt to prevent a witness from testifying and avoid punishment for the crime & \n\nreasons, the Court has held that presumptively involuntary statements taken in violation of Miranda may be used by the prosecution for impeachment purposes on cross-examination. See Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971). These holdings do not extend to cases of actually coerced confessions. Before Fulminante, the distinction between actually and presumptively coerced confessions was relevant with regard to harmless error as well. In deciding, as the Su preme Court did in Fulminante, that the improper introduction at trial of an actually coerced confession is subject to harmless error analysis, the Court overturned a well established line of precedent which held to the contrary. See Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 65 S.Ct. 781, 89 L.Ed. 1029 (1945) (<HOLDING>); Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 376, 84 S.Ct. holding introduction of actually coerced confession constitutes reversible error even where confession was cumulative in natureholding failure of prosecution to disclose evidence that may be favorable to the accused is a violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendmentholding that states procedure providing for jury evaluation of voluntariness of a defendants confession violates fourteenth amendment due processholding that introduction of an actually coerced confession deprives the defendant of his fourteenth amendment rights to due process even if ample evidence existed to otherwise support the convictionholding that question of whether a confession was coerced was not to be resolved by considering the truth or falsity of the confession & \n\nCourt subsequent to his trial. Effecting a significant change in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, the Supreme Court ruled in 2004 that in criminal prosecutions, unless a declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him, the Confrontation Clause forbids use against the defendant of the declarant\u2019s out-of-court testimonial statements admitted for their truth. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The Government does not dispute that the pleas, allocutions, and post-arrest statement made at a proffer session constitute \u201ctestimonial statements\u201d of the sort barred by Crawford. We assume without deciding that this characterization is correct. Cf. United States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); see also Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. at holding that in order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support a judgment based on a plea of guilty or no contest a defendant must bring forward a full statement of facts including a transcription of the plea proceedingsholding that a plea allocution is a testimonial statementholding that the defendant was entitled to have his plea accepted absent a sound reason for rejecting the pleaholding that plea of guilty or nolo contendere is not rendered involuntary because it is a product of plea bargaining an accepted plea bargain must be recorded and court may accept a bargained plea to a lesser offense reasonably related to a charged offenserecognizing that a voluntary and understanding guilty plea entered without the benefit of a plea bargain waives all nonjurisdictional defects that occurred before the entry of the plea & \n\nof the defects. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d); see United States v. Velasco-Medina, 305 F.3d 839, 847 (9th Cir.2002); United States v. Arrieta, 224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000). In addition, an alien is barred from collaterally attacking the validity of an underlying deportation order \u201cif he validly waived the right to appeal that order\u201d during the deportation proceedings. Muro-Inclan, 249 F.3d at 1182 (citation omitted). Such a waiver must be \u201cconsidered and intelligent.\u201d Id. A waiver is not considered and intelligent when the record contains an inference that the petitioner is eligible for relief from deportation, but the IJ fails to advise the alien of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue. United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Pallares-Galan, 359 F.3d holding that iirira and aedpa are not applicable to criminal alien who entered a guilty plea at a time when alien was eligible for 212c reliefholding that failure to advise an alien of possible forms of relief may violate due processholding that the ijs failure to inform alien that he is eligible for relief from deportation constitutes due process violation where alien establishes prejudicerecognizing burden is on alien when alien is removableholding that there is no due process violation where the ijs finding was not arbitrary and the alien was not denied a full and fair opportunity to present his claims & \n\nconsequences of his own wrongful acts. It grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated. Id. at 158. In other words, while the Constitution does grant a privilege of confronting ones accusers, that privilege is lost if the accuser causes the witness's unavailability at trial. \u00b6 40. Since the Reynolds decision, the Court has continued to acknowledge the concept that a defendant can forfeit through misconduct his or her confrontation rights. See, e.g., Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 451-53 (1912) (<HOLDING>); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106 holding that a hearsay statement can itself be considered in first determining if a conspiracy existed when the statement was madeholding that defendant who introduced hearsay statement waived objection to admission of another part of same statementholding that a defendant waives right to object to a hearsay statement on confrontation grounds when he or she offers the statementholding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding prior statement subject to crossexamination when made does not violate confrontation clause & \n\na record cannot qualify as a business record if it was prepared for purposes of litigation. See, e.g., United States v. Feliz, 467 F.3d 227, 234 (2d Cir.2006). But where a document is created primarily for the government to use it as a substitute for live testimony in a criminal prosecution, the fact that the document might happen to fall within the jurisdiction\u2019s business records exception to the hearsay rule does not render the document non-testimonial. Accordingly, because DEA chemist\u2019s reports are created expressly for use in criminal prosecutions as a substitute for live testimony against the accused, such reports are testimonial, whether or not they happen to meet this jurisdiction\u2019s definition of a business record. See State v. Caulfield, 722 N.W.2d 304, 309-10 (Minn.2006) (<HOLDING>). ' Citing Howard, 473 A.2d at 839, the holding that bureau of criminal apprehension bca laboratory report identifying a substance as cocaine was testimonial and implicated defendants right to confrontationholding that state bureau of criminal apprehension laboratory report offered at trial to prove that substance seized from defendant was cocaine was clearly prepared for litigation and was testimonialholding forensic laboratory experts statement that substance was cocaine is testimonial for sixth amendment confrontation clause purposesholding that fdle lab report reflecting that substances possessed by defendant were marijuana and cocaine was testimonial as such document was accusatory was prepared by law enforcement pursuant to a police investigation and was admitted to establish an element of the crimerecognizing that evidence regarding the high price the defendant had paid for the substance in question was relevant to show the substance was cocaine & \n\nS.W.3d at 638; Gutierrez-Gomez, 321 S.W.3d at 682. When the record is silent regarding the consequences of conviction in the context of a guilty plea, we must infer that the defendant did not know the consequences of his plea. VanNortrick, 227 S.W.3d at 710-11; Gutierrez-Gomez, 321 S.W.3d at 682; Kelley v. State, 237 S.W.3d 906, 908 (Tex.App.-Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. ref'd). A reviewing court may also consider record facts from which one would reasonably infer that a defendant did know the consequences of his plea. Burnett, 88 S.W.3d at 638; Gutierrez-Gomez, 321 S.W.3d at 682. Only a few Texas cases outline the sort of record evidence that would support an inference that appellant was aware of the consequences of his guilty plea. See, e.g., Gutierrez-Gomez, 321 S.W.3d at 682-84 (<HOLDING>); Hwang v. State, 130 S.W.3d 496, 500-01 holding record insufficient to support inference appellant knew consequences of his plea when record is silent about whether appellant was actually informed that a guilty plea could result in his deportationholding that absence of defendants from part of voir dire discussing trial publicity with prospective jurors was error under rule 43holding that the extent to which parties may examine prospective jurors on voir dire lies within the trial judges discretionholding statements during voir dire and oral motion in limine were merely opaque references to deportation but silent about whether appellant was actually informed that a guilty plea could result in his deportation and insufficient to support inference appellant knew consequences of his pleaholding trial judges statement during voir dire that appellant likely would be automatically deported if released on probation along with references to deportation by defense counsel and prospective jurors supported inference that appellant knew consequences of plea & \n\nof a detailed offer of proof, which includes affidavits, in support of the allegations of falsity is one of the five requirements that a defendant must fulfill to warrant a Franks hearing. United States v. Di Cesare, 765 F.2d 890, 894 (9th Cir.1985). More recently, the Ninth Circuit has stated that a defendant\u2019s failure to offer an affidavit or sworn statement in support of allegations that a warrant affidavit was based upon deliberately false information is enough in itself to defeat a defendant\u2019s demand for an eviden-tiary hearing under Franks. United States v. Ruddell, 71 F.3d 331, 334 (9th Cir.1995). The Seventh Circuit has addressed the issue of the sufficiency of a defendant\u2019s offer of proof in a number of decisions. See United States v. Walker, 25 F.3d 540, 544-45 (7th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Pace, 898 F.2d 1218, 1225 holding that the burden of laying the proper foundation for the admission of the expert testimony is on the party offering the expert and admissibility must be shown by a preponderance of the evidenceholding that the prosecutors comment regarding the defendants failure to call a potential witness did not shift the burden of proof because it did not implicate the defendants fifth amendment right not to testifyholding that the burden of proof is on the claimantholding where tape corroborated by independent testimony of two police officers and where defendant did not challenge accuracy of recording court did not err in admitting tape despite prosecutions failure to authenticate itholding that the defendants offer of proof which consisted only of a tape recording and a private investigators affidavit did not satisfy the defendants preliminary burden under franks without the offering of other sworn testimony or reliable evidence & \n\nthat the admission of Permanian\u2019s statements violated the holding in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 20 L. Ed. 2d 476, 88 S. Ct. 1620 (1968). In Bruton, the Supreme Court held that the defendant was deprived of his rights under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment when his codefendant\u2019s post-arrest confession, which incriminated the defendant, was admitted at their joint trial. In reaching its decision, the Court acknowledged that there was no recognized exception to the hearsay rule before it. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 128 n.3, 20 L. Ed. 2d at 480 n.3, 88 S. Ct. at statements admissible because there was sufficient indicia of reliability). Moreover, defendant was able to confront and cross-examine Rinaldi, who testified about the statements. See Ramey, 151 Ill. 2d at 528 (<HOLDING>); Goodman, 81 Ill. 2d at 284 (same). We holding that testimonial hearsay statements of a witness who does not appear at trial are inadmissible under the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to crossexamine the witnessholding that the sixth amendment confrontation clause was not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under a georgia statute permitting an exception for statements by coconspirators where there was sufficient indicia of reliability supporting the truth of the statementsholding coconspirator hearsay exception does not violate confrontation clauseholding that the sixth amendment right of confrontation applies to all three phases of the capital trial and that the admission of hearsay statements of codefendants in the penalty phase violated the confrontation clauseholding that the confrontation clause of the sixth amendment is not violated by the admission of hearsay statements under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule where the defendant was able to confront and crossexamine the witness who claimed that the statements at issue were made & \n\ncommittee notes (1972) (describing rationale underlying exception as \u201c[t]he element of unusual reliability ... said variously to be supplied by systematic checking, by regularity and continuity which produce habits of precision, by actual experience of business in relying upon them, or by a duty to make an accurate record as part of a continuing job or occupation\u201d) (citation omit ted). Thus, the motivation of a record\u2019s author is relevant to admissibility. Id. Not every item of business correspondence constitutes a business record. See, e.g., Breeden v.

While we adhere to this discretionary standard for review of the district court\u2019s Rule 702 gatekeeping deeision, cases are legion that, correctly, under Daubert, call for the liberal admission of expert testimony.

The case was docketed here for the January 2014 term and submitted for decision on the briefs. 2 In addition, OCGA \u00a7 16-3-21 (d) (2), which was enacted in 1993, authorizes relevant expert testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s condition of mind at the time of the offense, including relevant facts and circumstances relating to the family violence or child abuse that are the bases of the expert\u2019s opinion, to support a justification defense in a prosecution for murder or manslaughter.

It is important to emphasize that we are taking no position on the question whether, in this context, expert testimony would be required if a party raised the point. We note, however, that there is nothing to prevent a person who acted in or observed the transactions or occurrences at issue from testifying as an expert on the applicable standard of care.

Dr. Margolis testified that Mr. Jones had only about a ten per cent, chance of infection over the course of a year. While the fact that the government would have presented an opposing expert is not by itself a' sufficient reason to exclude Dr. Gubbins\u2019s testimony, it was a factor that the District Court properly considered in its assessment.

In addition to prohibiting legal expert testimony which defines the governing law, courts have also prohibited legal expert opinion which applies the law to the facts. Many courts have held that the judge is the sole arbiter of the law and its application to the facts. See, Marx & Co. v. Diners\u2019 Club, Inc., 550 F.2d 505, 508-11 (2d Cir.1977)(<HOLDING>); Peterson v.

Haward cross-examined Officer Knapp but did not offer a fingerprint expert of his own. The jury ultimately found Haward guilty of one count of possession of a firearm by a felon. In this court Haward first argues that the district court did not properly conduct its Daubert hearing to determine the admissibility of fingerprint evidence under Rule 702, a determination that we review de novo. See United States v. Cruz-Velasco, 224 F.3d 654, 659 (7th Cir.2000). Specifically, he contends that fingerprint evidence is inadmissible under Daubert because it is not \u201cscientifically\u201d based. The standards of Daubert, however, are not limited in application to \u201cscientific\u201d testimony alone. See Kumho, 526 U.S. at 147, 119 S.Ct. 1167 (<HOLDING>). Therefore, the idea that fingerprint holding that the district court properly admitted expert testimony under daubert that was based on inter alia the doctors clinical experience and review of the medical recordsholding that daubert applies not only to testimony based on scientific knowledge but also to testimony based on technical and other specialized knowledgeholding that the general principles of rule 702 recognized by the daubert decision are applicable to other species of expert testimonyholding that daubert does not create a new framework for analyzing proffered expert testimony based upon technical or other specialized knowledge holding that the basic gatekeeping obligation of daubert applies to all expert testimony & \n\n408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), the United States Supreme Court also expressed the view that a witness\u2019 motive to lie does not render his or her testimony inadmissible: \u201cThe petitioner is quite correct in the contention that [the informant], perhaps even more than most informers, may have had motives to lie. But it does not follow that his testimony was untrue, nor does it follow that his testimony was constitutionally inadmissible. The established safeguards of the Anglo-American legal system leave the veracity of a witness to be tested by cross-examination, and the credibility of his testimony to be determined by a properly instructed jury.\u201d Id. at 311, 87 S.Ct. at 418. Other cases in accord with Cervantes-Pacheco include: United States v. Valle-Ferrer, 739 F.2d 545, 547 (11th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Edwards, 549 F.2d 362, 365 holding that claim that counsel was ineffective for allowing defendant to proceed while incompetent was facially insufficient where defendant did not allege he actually was incompetent to proceed to trial or insane at the time of his offenseholding that the due process clause prohibits the trial of a person who is incompetentholding that a contractors experience in his profession qualifies him to testify as an expert to reasonable ratesholding that right to testify not denied where inter alia defendant made no objection to his attorneys statements that defendant would not testify and made no request to testifyholding that an informants anticipated receipt of 1000 if his testimony resulted in a conviction did not render him incompetent to testify & \n\nliability,\u201d as well as steep civil fines, \u201con a broad range of ordinary industrial and commercial activities.\u201d Rapanos v.

Therefore, because the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on a tract of land has a significant impact on the value of that tract, evidence regarding jurisdictional wetland amounts is relevant and material to fixing just compensation. Accordingly, we conclude that the master was authorized to make a ruling as to the amount of jurisdictional wetlands existing on the parcel as of the condemnation date so that the just compensation owed to Normandy could ultimately be determined.

It is proper for the jury to be charged in the disjunctive even though the indictment (or information) may allege the differing methods of committing the offense in the conjunctive. Kitchens v. State, 823 S.W.2d 256, 258 (Tex.Crim.App.1991).

The Beros court noted that \u201cjust as the sixth amendment requires jury unanimity in federal criminal cases on each delineated offense that it finds a defendant culpable ... it must also require unanimity regarding the specific act or acts which constitutes that offense. Absent such certainty, the unanimity requirement would provide too little protection in too many instances.\u201d Id. at 461. The Seventh Circuit came to the same conclusion in a case very similar to Holley. See United States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 471 (7th Cir.1998). But see United States v. Margiotta, 646 F.2d 729, 733 (2d Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>).

The trial court expressly limited the admission of the evidence of the subsequent rape in instructions to the jury both before the tender of the evidence and in its final mandate to the jury immediately prior to their deliberations. As the evidence of the subsequent rape was admitted in part to show intent and modus operandi of defendant, remoteness in time of the second act is less important to its admissibility. Id. As defendant concedes, this Court has upheld the admission of evidence under Rule 404(b) where the crimes] wrongs, or acts occurred after the offenses for which a defendant was on trial. State v.

It is not error to inform the resentencing jury that the defendant has already been found guilty, and to tell the jury that its duty is to determine the punishment to be imposed, considering \u201call of the evidence\u201d presented at the resentencing trial, and \u201call of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d Transcript, Vol. 41 at 2851, 2857-59. See Alderman v. State, supra at 212 (11 b). 14. Potts complains of the state\u2019s use of a prior conviction for murder based on a guilty plea that was not shown to be voluntary. See Pope v. State, supra at 195 (17) (<HOLDING>). Potts raised before trial the issue of holding that once the defendant raises the issue of intelligent and voluntary waiver with respect to prior guilty pleas the burden is on the state to establish a valid waiverholding that record did not show voluntary or intelligent waiverrecognizing that the burden to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional right is upon the prosecutionholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nprior convictions, and that he initially lied to the police because he did not think that they would believe him due to these convictions. The defendant\u2019s defense to the charges was self-defense and his credibility was a critical aspect of the case. The jury was specifically instructed that in weighing the testimony of a witness, one of the factors they should consider was whether the witness had ever been convicted of a crime. Thus, the nature of the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, which would have included the fact that the defendant had never used a weapon, threatened, or harmed anyone during the commission of these felonies, was relevant, and therefore, the trial court erred in precluding the defendant\u2019s testimony. See Lawhorne, 500 So.2d at 522; Williams, 730 So.2d at 779 (<HOLDING>). The defendant also contends that the trial holding that it was error for the trial court to allow the state to question the confidential informant on direct examination about her lack of felony charges when there was no prior attack of the witnesss credibilityholding that stipulation of the appellants undisputed prior convictions was harmless error and reasoning that blakely v washington which does not require a jury determination of prior convictions provides implicit support for the conclusion that a harmless error analysis is appropriateholding that any error was harmless and thus not plain errorholding that it was not error for the court to give a substantive new instruction to the jury after deliberations began where the instruction was given in court with the defendant and his counsel presentholding that the trial courts error in not allowing defendant to testify on direct examination as to nature and circumstances of prior convictions was not harmless error where credibility of the defendant was critical to the deliberations of the jury & \n\noverturned unless no reasonable juror could have found that the govern ment disproved either element of entrapment beyond a reasonable doubt, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. United States v. Jones, 976 F.2d 176, 180 (4th Cir.1992). In this case, the Government produced evidence that undercut at least the element of predisposition. Whether to believe this evidence or accept Mannar\u2019s conflicting evidence was a question for the jury. United States v. Murphy, 35 F.3d 143, 148 (4th Cir.1994). The fact that the jury could not reach a verdict on the first count does not amount to a finding of entrapment; even if it did, it would not preclude a rejection of that defense for the second count. See United States v. Vaughn, 80 F.3d 549, 552-53 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (<HOLDING>). Mannar also asserts that the district court holding that jury finding of entrapment in may and june offenses did not extend to august offenseholding that erroneous exclusion of evidence regarding defendants lack of criminal record was not harmless in prosecution for drug offenses in which defendant asserted entrapmentholding that where jury was instructed on both a greater offense and lesserincluded offense and the jury convicted on the lesserincluded offense the double jeopardy provision prohibited retrial on the greater offenseholding that in the conviction and sentencing for criminal offenses committed in the course of one criminal episode it is the intent of the legislature that there be a separate conviction and sentence for each criminal offense unless one of the offenses is a degree of the other a necessarily included lesser offense subsumed in the other or both offenses are identicalholding that state may charge separately for the same offense but the convictions for more than one of the offenses cannot stand & \n\nof Leistiko. State v. Jones, 353 Or 208, 297 P3d 480 (2013). On remand, we concluded that a trial court\u2019s admission of prior bad acts evidence under OEC 404(3) to prove a defendant\u2019s intent \u2014 in a case in which the defendant disputed committing the charged acts and the jury had not been instructed that it must first find that the defendant had committed the charged acts before it could consider the prior bad acts evidence to determine intent \u2014 was properly reviewable as plain error, in light of Leistiko, because \u201cplain error\u201d is determined by the law as it exists at the time the appeal is decided. Jones, 258 Or App at 5-6 (discussing Leistiko, 352 Or at 174; State v. Jury, 185 Or App 132, 136, 57 P3d 970 (2002)); see also State v. Hutton, 258 Or App 806, 816, 817-18, 311 P3d 909 (2013) (<HOLDING>). We now apply the foregoing principles to this holding that to admit evidence of prior bad acts under rule 404b ala r evid the state must demonstrate that the evidence was reasonably necessary to its caseholding admission of prior bad acts of child abuse was reversible error when the defendant did not have exclusive control over the children during the period when the prior bad acts occurredholding prior bad acts evidence is admissible where there is an articulation or identification of the consequential fact to which the proffered evidence of other acts is directedholding that it is error for a trial court to admit evidence of prior bad acts without properly conditioning the jurys use of that evidenceholding on a criminal appeal that prior bad acts evidence is admissible to prove intent to commit the charged crime & \n\nremains the same,\u201d such as by correcting a \u201cmisnomer\u201d or mistake of form. United States v. Young Bros., Inc., 728 F.2d 682, 693 (5th Cir.1984). Thus, the issue is whether the amendment to the serial number constituted a change in form akin to correcting a typographical error or a change in substance that impermissibly altered the indictment. Although we have never addressed this question directly, precedent from this circuit and others suggests that the particular attributes of a firearm are not actual elements of the offense. See, e.g., United States v. Munoz, 150 F.3d 401, 417 (5th Cir.1998) (finding no grounds to reverse conviction when indictment charged a dif ferent gauge of shotgun than that presented during trial); United States v. Robinson, 974 F.2d 575, 578 (5th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Robison, 904 F.2d 365, 369 holding that government may prove facts outside the overt acts alleged in the indictmentholding that when an indictment alleges nonessential facts the government need not prove them in order to sustain a convictionholding that the government need not prove actual notice to the prisonerrecognizing that the government need only prove that crime occurred reasonably near the date stated in the indictmentholding that the fact of prior convictions under 924e need not be charged in an indictment and proven to a jury and also that the government need not charge in an indictment and prove to a jury that a defendants prior conviction constitutes a violent felony under 924e & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v. Wisconsin, 501 U.S. 171, 178, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158 (1991); see also State v. Kennedy, 333 S.C. 426, 430, 510 S.E.2d 714, 715 (1998) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, this Court has held that [\u0430] holding that juveniles request for parent is invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that a suspects invocation of the right to remain silent must be unequivocal to require that police questioning ceaserecognizing two aspects to assertion of fifth amendment rights 1 a reasonable police officer in the circumstances would understand request was made for an attorney and 2 the request was for assistance with a custodial interrogation not for subsequent hearings or proceedingsholding a juveniles request to speak to a probation officer is not a per se invocation of fifth amendment rightsholding that an unequivocal invocation of the fifth amendment right to counsel must be presented in a manner that a reasonable police officer under similar circumstances would understand the statement to be a request for the presence of an attorney & \n\nBlankenship admits that these prior convictions fall within the class of felonies to which the statute refers, but he contends that they were too remote in time to serve as a proper predicate for enhancement of the sentence. If a statute that imposes a criminal penalty is ambiguous, it must be construed in favor of the defendant. See Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980). However, in this case, section 924(e)(1) is not ambiguous. There is no indication, either in the statute or in the legislative history, that Congress intended to include a temporal restriction in that statute. See United States v. Green, 904 F.2d 654, 655-56 (11th Cir.1990); see also Young v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 690 F.Supp. 990, 995 (S.D.Ala.1988) (<HOLDING>). We refuse to construct such a restriction out holding the use of a 1951 felony conviction as a predicate for a violation of 18 usc 922g1 did not violate the ex post facto clause because the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm was not committed until after the effective date of the statute under which he was convictedholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that countholding that period of proscription for firearm ownership under section 922g1 was indefiniteholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violation & \n\nnot \u201cserious\u201d enough to require the protection of that a constitutional guaranty of jury trial does not apply to proceedings to punish for contempt of court whether in a court of law, a court of equity, a court having criminal jurisdiction, or other court.\u201d Pass v. State, 181 Tenn. 613, 184 S.W.2d 1, 3 (1944) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ahern v. Ahern, 15 S.W.3d 73, 82 (Tenn.2000). Additionally, unlike criminal prosecutions, general contempt proceedings do not require an indictment and subsequent' prosecution by the State. Tenn. R.Crim. P. 42(b)(2); Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 185-86, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958), overruled in part on other grounds by Bloom, 391 U.S. at 196 n. 1, 198, 88 S.Ct. 1477; State v. Wood, 91 S.W.3d 769, 773 (Tenn.Ct.App.2002) (<HOLDING>). Contempt proceedings are often initiated upon holding that the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches at the time of a formal charge which we construe to be an arrest warrant or at the time of the preliminary hearing in those rare cases where a preliminary hearing is not preceded by an arrest warrant or by indictment or presentment when the charge is initiated by the grand jury quoting state v mitchell 593 sw2d 280 286 tenn 1980recognizing that an indictment may be dismissed in partholding a statement in the motion for new trial entitled certificate of presentment in which appellate counsel stated the motion was handdelivered to the trial court insufficient to establish presentmentrecognizing that criminal contempt is not initiated by an indictment or presentmentholding that certificate of presentment and docket entry noting filing of motion were insufficient evidence of presentment & \n\nof each of the burglaries. See Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2) (permitted uses of other-bad-acts evidence). His presence near eight burglaries over 5 months, where each burglary was characterized by substantially similar circumstances pointing to a common culprit or culprits, is powerful identity evidence. With regard to whether the evidence from the different burglaries was capable of separation by the jury, and whether Appellant was unduly prejudiced by the decision not to sever the cases, the trial court notes that the verdict speaks for itself: Appellant was acquitted of several burglaries and conspiracy counts, indicating that the jury clearly was able to parse the evidence involved in each individual case. See TOO at 11. We agree. See Commonwealth v. Dozzo, 991 A.2d 898, 903 (Pa. Super. 2010) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that each defendants actions in a 1983 case must be considered individuallyholding that the jury found the ajppellant not guilty of all charges in one case and not guilty of three out of four charges in a second case demonstrating the jury considered each case and each charge separately and did not cumulate the evidenceholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants request for severance because the district court nullified any prejudicial error when it repeatedly admonished the jury throughout the trial to consider the evidence only against the defendant to whom it related and at the end of trial gave the jury instructions that admonished the jury to consider separately each offense and evidence in support of each offenseholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to accept the defendants guilty pleas to two counts of the indictment and stating that even if the trial court erred the error had not prejudiced the defendant because he was found guilty by the jury of the charges to which he intended to plead and the evidence of the other crimes would have been admissible in the trial for the first degree murder chargeholding that an exception to the charges having to do with contributory negligence charges two three and four was insufficient to preserve issue for appeal & \n\noffense of attempt\u00e9d second-degree murder based on knowing merely that one\u2019s conduct will cause serious physical injury, the giving of the instruction was reversible error. Ontiveros\u2019s conviction must therefore be reversed. CONCLUSION \u00b6 20 We reverse Ontiveros\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial. Because of this disposition, we do not reach the sentencing issue raised by Ontiveros. CONCURRING: G. MURRAY SNOW, Presiding Judge and DONN KESSLER, Judge. 1 . The offense of attempted second-degree murder under \u00a7\u00a7 13-1001(A)(2) and -1104(A)(2) does not, contrary to Ontiveros\u2019s argument, require an intent to cause death. The culpable mental state of knowingly causing the death of another is sufficient under \u00a7 13-1104(A)(2). Cf. State v. Nunez, 159 Ariz. 594, 769 P.2d 1040 (App.1989) (<HOLDING>).

App. 584, holding that where the meaning of the jurys verdict was not clear in light of the trial courts jury instructions the court of appeals erred in directing entry of judgment for respondent the case should have been remanded to the trial judge who was in the best position to pass upon the question of a new trial in light of the evidence his charge to the jury and the jurys verdictholding that verdict returned by jury should have been received and recorded and that trial court erred by granting a continuance after jury returned its verdict applying the principle announced in merchantsbank of macon 7 ga at 200 4 that a verdict shall be considered as published eo instanti in which it is handed to the plaintiffs counsel or other person directed by the court to receive it emphasis omittedholding that trial court erred in granting plea in bar as to murder when prior to receipt and publication of fact that jury could not reach a verdict on murder count jury had indicated in notes to the trial court that it had acquitted defendant of murder and holding that there was no verdict until it was received and published in open courtholding that after court dismissed case at plaintiffs request notwithstanding the fact that jury had deliberated upon the case and indicated that it had reached a verdict there was no case pending in court on which a verdict could be predicated and the information which the judge got from an inspection of the petition handed to him by the foreman of the jury was information which he received as an individual and not as a judge of the court and further holding that despite violation of defendants right to receive the verdict that was purportedly reached the writing incorporated in the bill of exceptions as a verdict of the jury was in law no verdict because it was not received in court and published as required by law and was instead entirely extraneous and extrajudicialholding that when determining prejudice under the objective test relevant considerations include 1 whether the extrinsic evidence was received by the jury and the manner in which it was received 2 whether it was available to the jury for a lengthy period of time 3 whether it was discussed and considered extensively by the jury 4 whether it was introduced before a jury verdict was reached and if so at what point during the deliberations and 5 whether it was reasonably likely to affect the verdict considering the strength of the governments case and whether the governments case outweighed any possible prejudice caused by the extrinsic evidence & \n\ndefendants also say that the prosecution presented false evidence to the grand jury in order to secure an indictment. We have reviewed the evidence and conclude that there is no evidence to indicate that the government\u2019s testimony and evidence before the grand jury was false. The majority of the arguments presented by the defendants go to the weight and interpretations of the evidence, instead of demonstrating actual false statements made by the government. In addition, many of the arguably false statements appear to be about information that is not material to the case. The Ninth Circuit appears to focus on the materiality of statements when analyzing whether there has been government misconduct that warrants sanctions. See United States v. Kennedy, 564 F.2d 1329, 1338 (9th Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>) Post-Indictment The second argument focus on holding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding that tribal courts are not subject to the fifth amendments requirement of indictment by grand juryholding that the trial court erred in denying the defendants motion in arrest of judgment when the indictment lacked a material element and it was not apparent that the grand jury based the indictment on facts that satisfy this element of the crime and that the only permissible cure was to send the matter back to the grand juryrecognizing that a constructive amendment to an indictment occurs when either the government the court or both broadens the possible bases for conviction beyond those presented by the grand juryholding that in the situation of a possible dismissal of an indictment because of possible grand jury tampering only where knowing perjury relating to a material matter has been presented to the grand jury should the trial judge dismiss an otherwise valid indictment & \n\nRule 29(c)). 9 . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) states, in relevant part; It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 10 .It is not clear whether the government attempted to demonstrate that the pistol and rifle were acquired separately and at different times or places. If they did not make such a showing, the indictment under which Alanis was charged would be duplicitous under our recent holding in United States v. Buchmeier, 255 F.3d 415, 422 (7th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The defense did not challenge the indictment holding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involvedholding that when the indictment charges that a certain minimum quantity of drugs is involved in the offense proof of that quantity is a fourth element of the offenseholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that the quantity of drugs involved in an offense does not support a downward departure because the legislature intended the quantity of drugs to be a determining factor in varying penaltiesholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that count & \n\nto as a \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d in which we look to the record of conviction, including the indictment, plea, verdict, and sentence (or any other documents admissible under the federal regulations to prove a criminal conviction, see 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.41 (1995)) to determine whether the actual offense of which the alien was convicted qualifies as a crime of violence. See Ye v. INS, 214 F.3d 1128, 1133 (9th Cir.2000); Solorzano-Patlan v. INS, 207 F.3d 869, 875 (7th Cir.2000); Wadman v. INS, 329 F.2d 812, 814 (9th Cir.1964); see also Pichardo-Sufren, 21 I. & N. Dec. 330, 334 (BIA 1996)(en banc). The courts have emphasized that it is not what the alien did, but the crime of which he was convicted, determined by the record of conviction, that is dispositive. Ye v. INS, 214 F.3d at 1133 (<HOLDING>); In re Madrigal-Calvo, 21 I. & N. Dec. 323, holding that once the statute is found to be divisible the court must look to the charging papers and judgment of conviction to determine if the actual crime of which defendant was convicted was a crime of violence but emphasizing that the court is not to examine the particular facts underlying the convictionholding that a court must only look to the statutory definition not the underlying circumstances of the crime to determine whether a given offense is by its nature a crime of violence for purposes of 18 usc 16holding that a district court may not rely on a charging document without first establishing that the crime charged was the same crime for which the defendant was convictedrecognizing that a court may look to the charging document in making a crime of violence determination but only where the statute provides disjunctive methods of committing the offense and the court needs to determine which of the statutory alternatives is involved in the particular caseholding that courts should look to the statutory definition of the crime charged rather than the actual facts of the individuals prior conviction to determine whether the crime qualifies as a violent felony under the acca & \n\nIt\u2019s a rather unusual circumstance, but I\u2019ve heard it before. Obviously, it\u2019s not unusual for participants in a trial to watch the jury, but we want to be sure that the jury is not made uncomfortable. So if I\u2019m correct that the regular attendees have been members of the family or friends of the defendants, I would appreciate counsel commenting to them when and as appropriate that we don\u2019t want to make the jurors uncomfortable, and what\u2019s actually a lot more interesting about a trial is what goes on in the well of the court and from the witness stand as opposed to the jury. So I share that with you just so you can convey the court\u2019s mild concern that the jurors not be made uncomfortable. It\u2019s nothing more than that. Okay? J.A. 915-16. There was no evidence that the judge had ir.1994) (<HOLDING>), and United States v.

Justice Hutchinson suggests that prior felony convictions must be factually similar to the conviction at issue in order to support the aggravating circumstance. Id. This interpretation of the aggravating circumstance by Justice Hutchinson, accepted by only one other Justice, is not binding precedent upon this court. See CRY, Inc. v. Mill Service, Inc., 536 Pa. 462, 640 A.2d 372, 376 n. 3 (1994). Additionally, we specifically rejected reliance upon Holcomb for the argument raised by Appellant in Commonwealth v. Young, 536 Pa. 57, 637 A.2d 1313, 1320-1321 (1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1012, 114 S.Ct. 1389, 128 L.Ed.2d 63 (1994) (<HOLDING>).

Therefore, the court holds that the second indictment in this case can properly be referred to as a \u201csuperseding\u201d indictment. The superseding-versus-new-indictment issue might have been an interesting and relevant debate if the Speedy Trial Act or the statute of limitations were the focus of defendants\u2019 appeals from the Detention Order, because those are the only situations in which it matters whether an indictment is a superseding indictme (D.C.1979) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Thoresen, 428 F.2d 654, holding that application of the doctrine of law of the case is discretionary and that a district court abuses its discretion in applying the law of the case doctrine only if 1 the first decision was clearly erroneous 2 an intervening change in the law occurred 3 the evidence on remand was substantially different 4 other changed circumstances exist or 5 a manifest injustice would otherwise resultholding that the law of the case doctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same caseholding that the application of the fair use doctrine at the pleading stage is appropriateholding that for all intents and purposes the instant case is the same action that was brought previously we therefore find the application of the doctrine of the law of the case to be appropriateholding that the degree of the loss of use of a body part is a question of fact whether the loss is for all practical intents and purposes is a question of law & \n\n"}

In addressing this issue, the District Court looked to a 1998 district court opinion that predicted that the New Jersey Supreme Court would not allow an affirmative cause of action for intentional spoliation, Larison v. City of Trenton, 180 F.R.D. 261, 266 (D.N.J.1998). The New Jersey Supreme Court has since authorized tort recovery for intentional spoliation. See Rosenblit, 766 A.2d at 758. Moreover, when it did so, the New Jersey Supreme Court did not adopt the strict causation and damages theories propounded by Larison. Compare Larison, 180 F.R.D. at 266 (predicting that a prima facie case could not be established unless and until the plaintiff shows that he failed to prove his original case because of the missing evidence), with Tartaglia, 961 A.2d at 1190 (<HOLDING>).

The Cooper decision rejected prior case law that did not require that an insurer show appreciable prejudice when an insured breached a condition precedent to insurance coverage: Cf. Whittle v. Associated Indem.

These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit. This case is, thus, distinguishable from those in which courts declined to dismiss claims recognized under New Jersey local law, even though out-of-state plaintiffs might have been unable to pursue such causes of action under their own state\u2019s local law. In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree.

The Penn National policies contain no language requiring the cause of injury to be identifiable before coverage is triggered.

Ulrich, 839 P.2d at 948. Applying this test to Ulrich, the court concluded that Ulrich\u2019s injuries did not occur as a natural consequence of the use of the motorist\u2019s truck, but rather occurred as a natural consequence of the motorist\u2019s use of a gun. Ulrich, 839 P.2d at 949. The court further commented that the motorist\u2019s intentional act of shooting was an independent, intervening cause of Ulrich\u2019s injuries, rendering the motorist\u2019s use of his truck legally insignificant.

Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla.

But these excuses do not make Monson\u2019s own conduct any less willful or malicious. The collapse of the business did not relieve Monson of the contractual obligations which he entered into or give him carte blanche to make off with equipment he bought with someone else\u2019s money. Demonstrably, Monson knew his actions were wrongful and without just cause. Further, Monson\u2019s behavior falls outside of the sort of reckless or unfortunate but non-malicious acts that this Court have previously held do not rise to the standard of a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

Under our reading of the policy, the CGL coverage does not completely subsume the CPPL coverage so as to render the latter superfluous. In some respects, the CGL coverage is more limited than the CPPL coverage. For example, the CGL coverage requires an \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined as an \u201caccident.\u201d The CPPL coverage does not require an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The CGL coverage also contains an exclusion for bodily injury that is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The CPPL coverage does not contain an exclusion for expected or intended injuries. Finally, the CGL coverage applies to \u201cbodily injury,\u201d but the CPPL coverage applies to \u201cinjury.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d is a narrower category than \u201cinjury.\u201d See Trinity Universal Ins.

Absent a contemporaneous objection, Jones\u2019 attorney was required to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted fundamental error. See Crump v.

Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nin their closing arguments and may advance all legitimate arguments and draw logical inferences from the evidence. See McArthur, 801 So.2d at 1039^40. Moreover, prosecutors in specific are not limited to a robotic presentation on behalf of the State. See Diaz v. State, 797 So.2d 1286, 1287 (Fla. 4th DCA 2001). However, \u201c[a] criminal trial is a neutral arena wherein both sides place evidence for the jury\u2019s consideration; the role of counsel in clos ing argument is to assist the jury in analyzing that evidence, not to obscure the jury\u2019s view with personal opinion, emotion, and nonrecord evidence.\u201d Ruiz, 743 So.2d at 4. Unfortunately, prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument is neither a new nor fading phenomenon. See, e.g., Crew v. State, 146 So.3d 101, 111 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014) (<HOLDING>); Freeman v. State, 717 So.2d 105, 106 (Fla. holding that the cumulative effect of the prosecutors comments which as seen above are welldocumented errors denied appellant a fair trialholding that cumulative effect of multiple errors worked to deprive defendant of fair trial although some errors standing alone would be subject to plain error review and others might be harmlessholding that although neither of the trial courts errors when considered in isolation were necessarily sufficiently prejudicial to require a new trial the cumulative effect of the errors created sufficient prejudice to deny defendant a fair trialholding that plain error is the appropriate standard of review when a defendant objects to a prosecutors comments at trial does not move for a mistrial and then on appeal argues that the comments deprived him of a fair trialholding that a number of errors may be deemed harmful in their cumulative effect & \n\n(1993). In \u00a7 2254 proceedings, the federal court must assess the prejudicial impact of a constitutional error in a state-court criminal proceeding under Brecht\u2019s more forgiving \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d standard, whether or not the state appellate court recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness under the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824,17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 2328, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007). The Brecht harmless error analysis also applies to habeas review of a sentencing error. The test is whether such error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the sentence. Calderon v. Coleman, 525 U.S. 141, 145-47, 119 S.Ct. 500, 142 L.Ed.2d 521 (1998) (<HOLDING>); Hernandez v.

So, I want you to keep that in mind. It\u2019s a pretty serious act of what happened.\u201d The defendant claims that, in the course of the state\u2019s closing argument excerpted here, the prosecutor made improper comments on facts that were not in evidence. We agree with the defendant. We now turn to the first step in our analysis of whether the defendant was deprived of his due process right to a fair trial by first determining whether summation statements made by the prosecution were improper. If they were not improper, there would be no need to address the second stage of analysis concerning whether substantial prejudice resulted to the defendant. \u201cA prosecutor, in fulfilling his duties, must confine himself to the 124 A. 820 (1924) (<HOLDING>). By making the challenged remarks, the holding improper counsels argument that plaintiff was entitled to something for manner in which defense was conductedholding that hearsay evidence is not acceptable in opposing a summary judgment motionholding improper counsels argument that opposing counsel knew why plaintiff delayed in bringing action where opposing counsels knowledge was not in evidenceholding prosecutors argument that defense counsels goal was to keep evidence from the jury was improperholding defense counsels rates to be an improper starting point in determining plaintiff counsels reasonable hourly rate & \n\nof analysis. If the mistake involved a discretionary act, the appellate court will review for an abuse of discretion. See Widmer, 744 A.2d at 753 (decision whether verdict is against weight of evidence is discretionary). If the mistake concerned an error of law, the court will scrutinize for legal error. See Morrison, 646 A.2d at 571 n. 8 (propriety of jury instructions entails question of law). If there were no mistakes at trial, the appellate court must reverse a decision by the trial court to grant a new trial because the trial court cannot order a new trial where no error of law or abuse of discretion occurred. See Von der Heide v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Transp., 553 Pa. 120, 718 A.2d 286, 290 (1998); Atene, 318 A.2d at 697; Kralik, 258 A.2d at 656; see also Riccio, 705 A.2d at 427 (<HOLDING>). If the appellate court agrees with the holding that it was error for the trial judge to answer a jurys question without giving defendants counsel an opportunity to be heard before the trial judge respondedholding that trial judge did not err in refusing to transfer to another judge defendants motion for substitution of judge for cause where defendants motion was not made in good faithholding that a defendant was not entitled to a relief under section 2255 when he asserted that the sentencing judge who was not the trial judge was influenced by the sentence imposed by the trial judge on a codefendantholding that because judge who was substituted for posttrial motions erred in finding that trial court judge made mistake of law grant of new trial was errorholding that where appellant moved to recuse trial judge from deciding the motion for new trial the judge of the administrative district was required to designate a judge to hear the recusal motion & \n\ncouncil\u2019s decisions were based on recommendations by the Bureau, those recommendations involved precisely the sort of delegated responsibility that earmarks the exercise of discretionary judgment. Plaintiffs alternative theory appears to be that defendant had a duty to succeed in executing a traffic management strategy that would prevent accidents. That assertion is incorrect. Immunity is not defeated merely because defendant\u2019s choice of traffic management and control devices did not prevent the tragic loss of life in this case or, for that matter, because plaintiffs expert testified that another strategy likely would have been more effective in reducing the incidence of speeding. See Garrison v. Deschutes County, 162 Or App 160, 167-68, 986 P2d 62 (1999), rev allowed 329 Or 650 (2000) (<HOLDING>). In Garrison, the plaintiff argued that the holding that once an expert has passed rule 702s threshold of admissibility lingering questions or controversy concerning the quality of the experts conclusions go to the weight of the testimony rather than its admissibilityholding that in granting summary judgment the trial courts disregard of the plaintiffs proffered expert testimony was not erroneous because that testimony would go not to the question of whether defendants decision took safety into account but rather would go to the question of the quality of the decisionholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendants motion for mistrial where the trial court sustained defendants objections to a question by the prosecutor containing improper information and instructed the jury to disregard the questionholding a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have beenholding that the supreme courts proper scope of review of a trial courts decision in a trial de novo of an assessment matter is whether the decision of the trial court was clearly erroneous & \n\n843; Roberts v. State, (1981) Ind.App., 419 N.E.2d 803. In this case, the prosecutor's argument was improper in several ways. Further, we are persuaded that this misconduct placed Johnson in a position of grave peril, so that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial. The prosecutor stated that a defense attorney's job is to \"get his client off\" by bringing out \"insignificant facts\" and \"legal technicalities.\" Our courts, finding no grave peril, have held that such remarks do not always mandate a mistrial. Hubbard v. State, (1974) 262 Ind. 176, 313 N.E.2d 346; Drossos v. State, (1982) Ind.App., 442 N.E.2d 1. Nevertheless, such comments are irrelevant to the issues to be decided by the jury and should not be allowed. See Craig v. State, (1977) 267 Ind. 359, 370 N.E.2d 880 (<HOLDING>). Further, the prosecutor asked the jury to holding that improper statement was rendered harmless because the district court sustained the defendants objection and admonished the jury to disregard the statementholding prosecutors statement that he had duty to all society including accused while a correct statement of the law was unfair and highly improperholding prosecutors statement that defendant and defense counsel were lying when they pleaded not guilty was improperholding that the district courts improper admission of an unauthenticated registration statement was harmless because the proponent of the registration statement later properly authenticated the statement in a motion to reconsiderholding appellate argument that statement violated rule 404b was improper because it was the defendant who elicited the statement at trial & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa.

Because appellant did not preserve the issue holding that the failure to object to a trial courts instruction constitutes waiverholding that plaintiffs failure to object to the improper comments of defendant during closing arguments resulted in waiver of plaintiffs right to argue the issue on appeal because the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issueholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that failure to object to trial courts refusal of further instruction to jury during deliberation results in waiver of issue on appealholding failure to object in timely fashion at trial results in waiver of issue for appeal & \n\npreserved her objections with regard to termination of the Lease. Tenant argues on appeal that it was error for the metropolitan court to terminate the Lease without finding a material violation of the Lease. Tenant further argues that it was error for the metropolitan court to consider Tenant\u2019s non-payment of June rent as part of the basis for terminating the Lease. Tenant appealed both of these issues to the district court, and the district court held that neither issue was preserved for review. As such, Tenant asks this Court to review her claim for fundamental error. Landlord responds that the doctrine of fundamental error is inapplicable to Tenant\u2019s appeal and argues that this Court should not consider the merits of Tenant\u2019s unpreserved appellate argumen 232, 236-37 (1905) (<HOLDING>), aff\u2019d, 204 U.S. 647 (1907).

Statements, like those made by the prosecutor here, \u201ccan be literally true but quite misleading by failing, for example, to disclose information essential to make what was said not misleading.\u201d Sawyer, 881 F.2d at 1285. As a result, a Caldwell violation may be established where a technically accurate statement describing the state appellate review process nonetheless \u201cmisled the jury to minimize its role in the sentencing process.\u201d Driscoll v. Delo, 71 F.3d 701, 713 (8th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>). Given the limited nature of the Delaware holding that under the alabama death penalty statute because the judge did not consider the jurys recommendation the statute which forced the jury to sentence the defendant to death whenever aggravating circumstances existed was not unconstitutionalholding that the fact that a judge had ruled against the defendant is not a basis for finding the judge prejudicedholding that a defendant was not entitled to a relief under section 2255 when he asserted that the sentencing judge who was not the trial judge was influenced by the sentence imposed by the trial judge on a codefendantholding that private individuals who conspired with judge could be sued even though judge could notholding that prosecutor had violated caldwell by emphasizing that the trial judge could disregard the jurys recommendation of death even though no state judge had in fact ever done so & \n\nis a weighing State or a nonweighing State. I would hold that the fact that a State is a nonweighing State may make the possibility of harmful error less likely, but it does not excuse a reviewing court from ensuring that the error was in fact harmless. Our cases in this area do not require a different result. IV The Court reaches a somewhat similar conclusion. It, too, would abolish (or at least diminish the importance of) the weighing\/nonweighing distinction for purposes of harmless-error analysis. But then, surprisingly, it also diminishes the need to conduct any harmless-error review at all. If all the evidence was properly admitted and if the jury can use that evidence when it considers other aggravating factors, any error, the Court announces, must be harmless. See ante, at 220 (<HOLDING>). Common sense suggests, however, and this holding that resentencing hearing in capital case is not barred by double jeopardy when appeals court rejects sole aggravating factor found by sentencer failure of sentencer to find other alleged aggravating factors is not an acquittal of these factors for double jeopardy purposesholding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it gave aggravating factors considerable weightholding that when one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances that underlie the invalidated aggravating factor areviewing court need not apply harmlesserror reviewholding that the grand jury need not find nonstatutory aggravating factorsholding that the death of a victim may not be considered an aggravating factor in a homicide sentencing & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\n1866. 18 . See, e.g., id., 500 U.S. at 365, 111 S.Ct. at 1869 (\"In the typical peremptory challenge inquiry, the decisive question will be whether counsel\u2019s race-neutral explanation for a peremptory challenge should be believed. There will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge. As with the state of mind of a juror, evaluation of the prosecutor\u2019s state of mind based on demeanor and credibility lies peculiarly within a trial judge\u2019s province.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). 19 . Washington, 34 S.W.3d at 380 (\"A trial court\u2019s ruling on a Batson challenge will not be disturbed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d). 20 . See, e.g., United States v.

II We next address what the Rule requires when a district court complies with the substantive requirements of the Rule, but fails to append to the presentence report the appropriate findings or determinations resolving the controverted matters. We hold that such a technical violation of the Rule is a ministerial error which does not require resentencing. The technical error must, however, be corrected by ordering the district court to append to the pre-sentence report the required findings or determinations. United States v. Knockum, 881 F.2d 730, 732 (9th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>); U.S. v. Gattas, 862 F.2d 1432, 1435; (10 holding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raise in the rule 32 petitionholding that appellate courts may not on appeal from the dismissal of a rule 32 petition consider claims not raised in the rule 32 petitionholding that a courts failure to provide a defendant with any portion of a habeas transcript was errorholding that error will not be presumed from a silent record and that without the relevant transcript there is insufficient evidence to review the alleged error and the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating the alleged error in the recordholding that ministerial error of failing to append rule 32 findings or determinations will not permit habeas relief because the error may be remedied by ordering the district court to attach the sentencing transcript & \n\nalso provided that \u201cin order to convict of manslaughter by intentional act, it is not neces sary for [the] State to prove that the defendant had a premeditated intent to cause death.\u201d This instruction did not require the jury to find that Mr. Jasper intended to kill the victim. See Daniels v. State, 72 So.3d 227, 232 (Fla. 2d DCA 2011) (finding 2008 amended instruction not fundamentally erroneous), review granted, 79 So.3d 744 (Fla.2012) ; Moore v.

Haygood v. State, 54 So.3d 1035, 1036, 1038 (Fla. 2d DCA) (<HOLDING>), review granted, 61 So.3d 410 (Fla.2011). At holding that the trial court committed fundamental error by giving the standard jury instruction for attempted manslaughter by actholding appellate counsel ineffective for failing to argue the trial court committed fundamental error in giving the thenstandard jury instruction for manslaughter by act even though controlling precedent in the district had approved the instruction when the instruction had been found fundamentally erroneous in another district and conflict between the two districts would have allowed defendant to seek relief in the supreme courtholding erroneous jury instruction on manslaughter by intentional act not fundamental error where trial court also instructed jury on manslaughter by culpable negligenceholding jury instruction on lesser included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter by act which required finding of intent to kill constituted fundamental error and required reversal of defendants conviction for seconddegree murderholding that erroneous manslaughter instruction that defendant intentionally caused the death of the victim did not constitute fundamental error certifying question if a jury returns a verdict finding a defendant guilty of seconddegree murder in a case where the evidence does not support a theory of culpable negligence does a trial court commit fundamental error by giving a flawed manslaughter by act instruction when it also gives an instruction on manslaughter by culpable negligence & \n\nhabeas federal district court failed to consider the substance of the statutory defense coded at ... \u00a7 25 ... when [it] deferred to the state [court\u2019s] ... dismissal .... \u201d); and 3 (\u201cThe federal district court[\u2019s] procedural ruling erred in determining that the State courts had made an \u2018adequate\u2019 determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d). We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nversa. Id. This court reviews a district court\u2019s determination of inequitable conduct under a two-tiered standard: we review the underlying factual determinations of materiality and intent for clear error, and we review the ultimate decision as to inequitable conduct for an abuse of discretion. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1365. If the district court\u2019s inequitable conduct determination rests on a clearly erroneous finding of materiality or intent, it constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed. Id. We agree with Honda that the undisclosed 96RL information was material to the Three-Status patent because the jury found, and the court upheld, the asserted claims as anticipated by the 96RL system, and ACI has not appealed that decision to us. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291-92 (<HOLDING>). The materiality of the undisclosed holding that in reviewing a defendants motion for judgment of acquittal based on insanity which the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence the court must determine whether no reasonable jury could have failed to find that the defendants criminal insanity at the time of the offense was established by clear and convincing evidenceholding that if a claim is properly invalidated in district court based on the deliberately withheld reference then that reference is necessarily material because a finding of invalidity in a district court requires clear and convincing evidence a higher evidentiary burden than that used in prosecution at the ptoholding that a finding of fraud may be reversed only for clear error but that the finding must be judged in view of the clear and convincing burden of proofholding that fraud on the court must be supported by clear unequivocal and convincing evidenceholding that appellate court may infer that district court considered sentencing guidelines policy statements despite district courts failure to make explicit reference to them & \n\nBeatty next contends that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by relying on the specific offense characteristic, \u201cmore than minimal planning,\u201d as the basis for both a two level upward adjustment pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(2)(A) and as one of its stated reasons for upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, p.s. Beatty does not contend that \u201cmore than minimal planning\u201d was not present in his offense conduct. He merely contends that the district court engaged in an improper form of \u201cdouble-counting\u201d when it used the same factor to increase his punishment under two separate and different provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines. We disagree. Double-counting is permitted in some circumstances. Compare United States v. Burnett, 952 F.2d 187, 188-90 (8th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>), and United States v. Thomas, 930 F.2d 12, holding that district court may consider defendants underlying conviction under both 2j16a and 4alla d when sentencing him for failure to appear to serve his sentenceholding that where a district court clearly indicates that an alternative sentence would be identical to the sentence imposed under the guidelines any error that may attach to a defendants sentence under booker is harmlessholding that where a furlough and an enhanced sentence for failure to appear in court at a later time are part of the plea agreement a court is justified in imposing the enhanced sentence after the defendant fails to appear in court without giving him an opportunity to withdrawhis pleaholding that district court may consider defendants underlying conviction under both 2p11a1 and 4alld e when sentencing him for escapeholding that sentencing court is permitted to consider evidence of both uncharged acts and evidence underlying counts on which the defendant has been acquitted & \n\nwith Rule 32.6(b)\u2019s pleading requirements. Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.7(d). While the Court of Criminal Appeals refers to all three of these rules in its peitinent order, we focus our analysis on Rule 32.6(b), as Frazier\u2019s failure to provide \"full disclosure of the factual basis\u201d of the relevant claim was the sine qua non of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s dismissal. 7 . It is uncontroversial that \"[i]f the petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies that are no longer available, that failure is a procedural default which will bar federal habeas relief, unless either the cause and prejudice or the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is established.\u201d Smith v. Jones, 256 F.3d 1135, 1138 (11th Cir.2001); see also Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep't of Corr., 568 F.3d 894, 908 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>).

Accordingly, an additional insured not only reaps the benefits of the insured\u2019s policy, but it also bears the burden of the exclusions. It is further our view that, if the insurer intended to exclude indemnification agreements within insured contracts from the substantial restriction on coverage that the On-Premises Endorsement constitutes, the policy would have expressly so stated. See Maroney v. New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 5 N.Y.3d 467, 805 N.Y.S.2d 533, 839 N.E.2d 886, 889 (2005) (stating that \u201c[i]f the insurer intended to limit [an] exclusion * * * it could have done so explicitly, as it does in the very same policy\u2019s * * * provisions\u201d); see also Chimbay v.

The Cooper decision rejected prior case law that did not require that an insurer show appreciable prejudice when an insured breached a condition precedent to insurance coverage: Cf. Whittle v. Associated Indem.

Anticipating our conclusion that estoppel requires a showing of prejudice, the Athridges maintain that prejudice should be presumed in this case.

See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 384 F.2d 316, 318 (D.C.Cir.1967); Diamond, 476 A.2d at 657-58. Assuming the Athridges were entitled to this presumption, summary judgment was still proper because Aetna rebutted the presumption with uncontroverted evidence that its participation did not harm Iglesias. Cf. Curtis v. Cuff, 537 A.2d 1072, 1075 (D.C.1987) (<HOLDING>).

The plaintiffs point out, if the first sentence of the exclusion is interpreted to be all-inclusive, the second sentence is superfluous. In light of the insurer\u2019s duty to define \u201cexclusionary clauses in clear and explicit terms,\u201d Homick, 511 N.W.2d at 374, we doubt that the clarifying language of the second sentence could properly be considered superfluous. In any event, notwithstanding our desire to interpret a policy so as not to render any part superfluous, \u201cwe will not do so when that [interpretation] is inconsistent with the structure and format of the [provision] and' when that [interpretation] is otherwise unreasonable.\u201d Kibbee, 525 N.W.2d at 869. In the named driver exclusion, the fi ion does not create an ambiguity. See id. at 1234 (<HOLDING>). To the contrary, the second sentence confirms holding exclusion was not ambiguousholding exclusion was harmless errorholding location of named driver exclusion in endorsement did not make it ambiguous exclusion applied to all coverage afforded by the policy including the um coverageholding similar regulatory exclusion is not ambiguous and rejecting secondary suit constructionholding second sentence of a nearly identical exclusion did not limit the scope of the exclusion & \n\nargues that because the suicide exclusion in the supplemental policy lacks the specific phrase \u201cwhether sane or insane\u201d it is not a valid defense to coverage. PL\u2019s Mem in Supp. at 19. ERISA has no bearing on this question of validity as suicide exclusions fall under the so-called \u201cinsurance exception\u201d to ERISA preemption and accordingly are governed by state law. See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Mass., 471 U.S. 724, 742 n.18, 105 S.Ct. 2380, 85 L.Ed.2d 728 (1985) (\u201cNearly every court that has addressed the question has concluded that laws regulating the substantive content of insurance contracts are laws that regulate insurance and thus are within the scope of the insurance savings clause.\u201d); Hoeflicker v.

Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C.

Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\nIns. Co., 512 So.2d 1125, 1128-29 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987). Regarding the difference between the grounds for rescission based on misrepresentations that are material as a matter of law, and misrepresentations that lead an insurer to issue a policy that it otherwise would not have issued if it had known the true facts, we have explained: 'While several of the decisions finding that a misrepresentation was material as a matter of law also address the issue of whether the insurer would have actually issued the policy under the same terms and same premium had it known the true facts, the consideration of that issue [is] not required in making a determination that a misrepresentation was material to the risk or the hazard assumed by the insurer. . \u00a1 Id. at 1128; see also Salgado, 22 So.3d at 604 (<HOLDING>). Th\u00e9 determination of materiality under holding that when the insurer takes the position that the policy does not cover the complaint the insurer must 1 defend the suit under a reservation of rights or 2 seek a declaratory judgment that there is no coverage if the insurer fails to take either of these actions it will be estopped from later raising policy defenses to coverageholding that the law is well settled that if the misrepresentation of the insured were material to the acceptance of the risk by the insurer or if the insurer in good faith would not have issued the policy under the same terms and premium then rescission of the policy by the insurer is proper emphasis added quoting ny life ins co v nespereira 366 so2d 859 861 fla 3d dca 1979holding that when an insurer files suit to cancel a policy the entire liability of the insurer both on the policy and under the statute is put in issueholding despite a reservation of rights that when the insurer provides a defense to its insured the insured has no right to interfere with the insurers control of the defense and a stipulated judgment between the insured and the injured claimant without the consent of the insurer is ineffective to impose liability upon the insurerholding that if the insured is only partially compensated by the insurer both the insurer and the insured are real partiesininterest & \n\nUnion made an unconditional agreement or an offer, as the Georgia Court of Appeals has held that an insurer is not estopped to dispute its defense obligations by reason of having sent letters to the insured in which the insurer initially agreed to defend the underlying suit. Ga. Farm, Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Vanhuss, 243 Ga.App. 26, 26, 532 S.E.2d 135, 136 (2000). In Vanhuss, the court held that where the insured did not claim that he relied to his detriment on the insurer\u2019s initial decision to defend the suits and no such reliance appears, the insured is not estopped from later denying coverage. Id.; see also Mahens v. Allstate Ins. Co., No. 1:10-cv-174, 2011 WL 1321578, at * 4 (N.D.Ga. Apr. 1, 2011) (citing Danforth v. Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co., 282 Ga.App. 421, 638 S.E.2d 852 (2007) (<HOLDING>)). Here, as in the Vanhuss case, there is holding that injured employee has right to settle with thirdparty tortfeasor claims not covered by minnesota workers compensation actholding that insurers assurances that it would pay for repairs including its attempt to settle with a thirdparty did not waive right to deny coverageholding that an insurer has no obligation to pay diminished value in addition to repairsrecognizing that an insurers obligation to pay for prenotification legal expenses is concomitant with its right to control the defense and that a contrary result would require the insurer to pay for those defense costs which it had no opportunity to controlholding insured relinquished right to sue general liability insurer for breach of contract relative to insurers allegedly improper handling and payment of thirdparty claim by purchasing policy which gave insurer right to settle & \n\nthe instigation of the insured and\/or his employees; 3) assault\/battery at the direction of the insured and\/or his employ ees; and 4) assault\/battery due to an omission by the insured and\/or his employees. Hudson asserts that the use of the word \u201comission\u201d in the exclusion means \u201cin this context is that the assault and\/or battery was caused by something the insured or his employees neglected or failed to do, which is significantly broader than merely saying the assault and\/or battery was actively done by the insured or his employees.\u201d (Doe. 47 at 4). Hudson references Seventh and Second Circuit case law as support for its claim that the exclusion applies via use of the word \u201comission.\u201d See generally United Nat. Ins. Co. v.

In this case, Farmers had a reasonable basis for denying the claim based on Perrotta\u2019s own breach of the policy. See Betco Scaffolds Co., 29 S.W.3d at 348. As such, Farmers did not breach its duty of good faith and fair dealing to Perrotta with regard to that denial, and Perrotta\u2019s extra-contractual claims fail as a matter of law. See United States Fire Ins. Co. v. Williams, 955 S.W.2d 267, 268 (Tex.1997) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we affirm summary judgment for holding title company liable for bad faithholding that bad faith includes lack of good faith in investigating the facts of a complaintholding insurer not liable for bad faith when it denied insureds claim based on a good faith dispute regarding the interpretation of a ruleholding there can be no claim for bad faith when an insurer has promptly denied a claim that is in fact not coveredholding that a bad faith claim is a tort & \n\nliability under the law of the state where the accident occurred. See Eugene F.

This application of Crossley is supported by cases from other jurisdictions cited in that opinion. See, Bachman v. American Mutual Insurance Co. of Boston, 338 F. Supp. 1372 (D. Kan. 1972) (concluding in action against decedent\u2019s insurer that plaintiff had failed to sustain his burden of showing uninsured motorist was liable for injuries to plaintiff\u2019s son); Noland v. Farmers Insurance Exchange, 413 S.W.2d 530, 533 (Mo. App. 1967) (<HOLDING>). This application of Crossley, supra, is also holding a personal profit exclusion applicable to an insured corporation where the purpose of the exclusion was to exclude coverage when the insured received profits to which the insured was not legally entitledholding that waiver of um coverage was ineffective under south carolina law because insurer did not adequately advise insured party about um coverageholding public policy of um statute not violated by exclusion of um coverage for passenger of vehicle driven by excluded driverholding that where missouri insured was injured in missouri when car in which she was riding was struck by separate uninsured vehicle driven by her husband and where missouri law precluded wife from suing husband insured was not entitled to um benefits because coverage was provided only when um motorist was legally responsible for damages noting that action against insurer was upon contract not tort and that the terms of the contract governholding that while the owner of several vehicles by paying a single premium for um coverage applicable to only one of them secures um coverage for himself and his family while occupying the uninsured vehicles as well as the insured vehicle the number of uninsured motorist coverages available to be stacked should be based upon the number of coverages for which uninsured motorist premiums were paid & \n\nan identical regulatory exclusion under similar facts, the court stated: Although the language \u201cbased upon or attributable to\u201d is awkward when used in conjunction with the language \u201cany action or proceeding brought by or on behalf of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u201d the court finds the FDIC\u2019s construction of this exclusion to be strained and unreasonable. (Footnote omitted). Reading the endorsement as a whole, without placing undue emphasis on the words \u201cbased upon or attributable to, \u201d it is clear that the insured\u2019s intent was to exclude coverage for any loss resulting from any action brought by or on behalf of the FDIC in any capacity against a bank director or officer.

Under our reading of the policy, the CGL coverage does not completely subsume the CPPL coverage so as to render the latter superfluous. In some respects, the CGL coverage is more limited than the CPPL coverage. For example, the CGL coverage requires an \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined as an \u201caccident.\u201d The CPPL coverage does not require an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The CGL coverage also contains an exclusion for bodily injury that is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The CPPL coverage does not contain an exclusion for expected or intended injuries. Finally, the CGL coverage applies to \u201cbodily injury,\u201d but the CPPL coverage applies to \u201cinjury.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d is a narrower category than \u201cinjury.\u201d See Trinity Universal Ins.

When the language of the insurance .policy is unambiguous, it is the court\u2019s duty to give the words used their plain meaning. Clemons, 879 S.W.2d at 391. Here, the policy unambiguously required the insured, Perrotta, to submit to an EUO and sign and swear to it. Perrotta relies on Century Ins. Co. v. Hogan, 135 S.W.2d 224 (Tex.Civ.App.\u2014 Austin 1939, no writ) for the proposition that his failure to sign and return the EUO was not a material breach of the policy.

The reason for this rule is that the insurer \u2018may not gamble\u2019 with the funds of its insured by refusing to settle within the policy limits.\u201d); Delaney v. St. Paul Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 947 F.2d 1536, 1547 (11th Cir.1991) (\u201cGeorgia law is clear that in a case in which a liability insurer defending a claim brought against its insured refuses, in bad faith, an offer to settle within the policy limits, and an excess judgment is entered against the insured, the insured may recover the amount by which the judgment exceeds the policy limits.\u201d);c\/ Trinity Outdoor, LLC v. Central Mut. Ins. Co., 285 Ga. 583, 679 S.E.2d 10, 13 (2009) (<HOLDING>).

For example, when a participant or assignee argues that,' with respect to a particular claim for payment, the claims administrator (or some affiliate thereof) \u201cinterfered\u201d with payment under the plan by unfairly denying the claim, courts have found that the interference claim is preempted. See, e.g., Adkins v. Unum Provident Corp., 191 F.Supp.2d 956, 959 (M.D.Tenn.2002); Steele v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 499 F.Supp.2d 1035, 1041 (E.D.Tenn.2007); Ctr. for Special Procedures v. Conn.

Although the issues were ultimately adjudged in its favor, Travelers was not substantially justified seeking a protective order at the time due to the substantial case law relying on the drafting history in interpreting the \u201csudden and accidental\u201d clause and its potential relevancy in aiding the court\u2019s determination.

As discussed above, the materiality of an omission is an issue for the court. 11 . The Ewings quote Shirk's testimony from Prater and Memory's trial, but the officers obviously did not have this information at the time they prepared the warrant affidavit. The Ewings also fault the officers for not asking Shirk more questions, such as whether he had been drinking, how long he looked at the female, whether her helmet face shield was up or down, and what the lighting conditions were. But judicial deception claims do not require an inquiry into the quality of the police investigation. See generally Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-36, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (<HOLDING>). 12 .

A government search of a private home presumptively violates the Fourth Amendment absent exigent circumstances or a valid warrant. See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). To be valid, the relevant portion of the Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant \u201cparticularly describe] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV (emphases added). The particularity requirement \u2014 \u201cthe touchstone of [the] warrant,\u201d Doe v.

Thus, the fourth element is met in this case. Finally, the Court readily finds that the omission was material in this case. \u201cThe subject matter of a false oath is \u2018material,\u2019 and thus sufficient to bar discharge, if it bears a relationship to the bankrupt\u2019s business transactions or estate, or concerns the discovery of assets, business dealings, or the existence and disposition of his property.\u201d Chalik, 748 F.2d at 617, citing In re Steiker, 380 F.2d 765, 768 (3d Cir.1967). Even the omission of assets of little value can be material. See, e.g., Olson, 916 F.2d at 484 (concluding that omission of dinner theater which had \u201cquestionable value\u201d was material for purposes of section 727(a)(4)(A)); Chalik, 748 F.2d at 619 (<HOLDING>).

The affidavit also indicated that Rowland had been observed on several occasions collecting his mail from the post office box and then walking back to work. Because the controlled delivery was made to Rowland\u2019s private post office box and not to his residence, however, establishing probable cause that the delivery would take place does not mean there was probable cause that the video tapes would be at Rowland\u2019s residence when the search took place. Therefore, this court must determine whether the affidavit supporting the anticipatory warrant contained evidence establishing a nexus between the contraband and Rowland\u2019s residence. See Hendricks, 743 F.2d at 654-55 (<HOLDING>). Only an oblique reference was made in the holding anticipatory warrant for search of defendants home was invalid when defendant was required to pick up suitcase containing contraband at airport and there was no assurance at time warrant was issued that defendant would take suitcase to his homeholding anticipatory warrant for search of defendants home was invalid because contraband was picked up by defendant rather than being delivered to his home and affidavit failed to provide facts establishing a nexus between contraband and defendants homeholding anticipatory warrant for search of defendants home was invalid when defendant was required to pick up suitcase containing contraband at airport and there was no information indicating defendant would take suitcase home or otherwise linking defendants residence to illegal activityholding anticipatory warrant for search of defendants home was invalid because affidavit provided no assurance that defendant would take package to his home after collecting it at the airport despite fact that warrant contained condition that it was not to be executed until package arrived at defendants householding anticipatory warrant for search of defendants home was invalid because facts made known to magistrate did not establish at time warrant was issued the required nexus between the contraband to be seized which was mailed to defendants post office box and defendants home & \n\nagents to exercise unfettered discretion, in part by explicitly placing conditions on execution). Consistent with these purposes, the conditions governing the warrant\u2019s execution should be \u201cexplicit, clear, and narrowly drawn so as to avoid misunderstanding or manipulation by government agents.\u201d Garcia, 882 F.2d at 703-04; accord Dennis, 115 F.3d at 528; Ricciardelli, 998 F.2d at 12. The particularity with which the magistrate should specify the conditions, however, will vary based on the individual facts of each case. Although the conditions precedent ensure that an anticipatory warrant will not be executed prematurely, such conditions do not serve as a substitute for the magistrate\u2019s probable cause determination. See United States v. Hendricks, 743 F.2d 653, 654-56 (9th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>).

Lalor, 996 F.2d 1578 (4th Cir.1993). See Opinion 2 (\"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated that 'residential searches have been upheld only where some information links the criminal activity to the defendant\u2019s residence.' \u201d (quoting Lalor, 996 F.2d at 1583)). In Lalor, we concluded that a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence was not supported by probable cause. See 996 F.2d at 1583. In so doing, however, we distinguished Lalor\u2019s case from prior ones, including Suarez and Williams, wherein the nexus between criminal activity and the targeted premises was based on evidence of the suspect\u2019s drug traf ficking activities combined with the reasonable inference that drug-related evidence would be found in the suspect\u2019s home. See id. at 1582-83 (<HOLDING>); id. at 1583 (observing that, in Williams, holding a person at anothers residence solely for the purpose of engaging in drug related activity has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the residenceholding that there was sufficient probable cause to search a defendants residence after evidence of drug dealing was found in his car during a traffic stop that was conducted when the defendant was coming from his residence and noting that under such circumstances a practical commonsense conclusion could be made that the drugs and money had been at the defendants residence a short time before the stopholding that the affidavit gave absolutely no indication that the fruits of criminal activity would probably be found at that location rendering the officers belief in probable cause based solely on the affidavit objectively unreasonable recognizing that in suarez residential search upheld based on officers reasoned belief that evidence of drug activity would be found at residenceholding that a warrant authorizing the search of a residence vehicles at the residence and all persons found in the residence was not overly broad given that search was limited to places were drugs or weapons might be found & \n\ndetermining whether the state court magistrate, who did not know about the information the Cl provided to Dunn on October 16, 1997, properly found that probable cause existed for the warrant to issue. This 'Court has long held that only the information presented under oath and affirmation to the judicial officer who issued the warrant may factor into the calculus of whether probable cause existed for the warrant to issue. See e.g., Tabasko v. Barton, 472 F.2d 871, 874-75 (6th Cir. 1972) (refusing to consider proof to support probable cause where statement at issue was not in affidavit and state court record failed to show that affiant made the statement under oath in state court before the issuing magistrate); see also United States v. Harris, 255 F.3d 288, 292-93 & n. 1 (6th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). There is no indication that the state magis holding informants testimony corroborated by evidence consisting of defendants presence at scene coupled with cash found in his pocket carrying serial numbers matching those provided to informant for controlled buy and videotape of transaction included conversation of defendant regarding prior drug saleholding that there was probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant where the officers corroboration of events that occurred during the controlled buy as set forth in the affidavit provide sufficient probable causeholding that affidavit officer submitted to state court judge coupled with officers sworn testimony before that judge regarding informants controlled drug purchases at defendants residence sufficed to establish probable causeholding that a controlled buy at a particular home provided probable cause for the search of that residenceholding that a known informants statement can support probable cause even though the affidavit fails to provide any additional basis for the known informants credibility & \n\n3 .

The Arizona Supreme Court added: \"The State has advanced no alternative theories justifying the warrantless search of Gant's car, and we note that no other exception to the warrant requirement appears to apply.\u201d Id. The court therefore did not inquire into the good-faith exception to suppression of evidence under the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule. 10 .

We further conclude that the Nevada \u201cknock and announce\u201d statute, NRS 179.055, was not violated. Several of the officers at the scene testified that they announced their presence by yelling something to the effect of \u201cPolice officer. Search warrant,\u201d prior to penetrating the premises. Immediately thereafter, shots were fired from the interior of the residence. We therefore hold that, under the circumstances of this case, the officers substantially complied with NRS 179.055 and properly entered the apartment under exigent circumstances to execute the warrant. See United States v. Fox, 790 F. Supp. 1487 (D. Nev. 1992) (<HOLDING>). 6. King contends that the State failed to holding that substantial compliance with notice is sufficientholding fourth amendment not violated by failure to announce where compliance would have increased officers perilholding that a sentence not in compliance with the mandatory provisions of a sentencing statute was illegal and appealableholding that compliance with an officers orders is a material fact when deciding whether the officers use of force was reasonableholding that noncompliance with nrs 179055 was justified where compliance with statute would have placed officers in great physical peril & \n\nWhile these observations by Hines \"express an opinion regarding the ultimate resolution of [a] disputed issue,\" the testimony does not eross the line drawn by rule 704 of the Utah Rules of Evidence. See State v. Larsen, 865 P.2d 1355, 1363 (Utah 1993). Hines's testimony was relevant in \"help{ing] the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\" see Utah R. Evid. 702(a), by explaining what concerns may drive an investor's decision to purchase a security. Compare Larsen, 865 P.2d at 1861 (determining that an expert's opinion testimony \"that some of the material that [the defendant] had omitted from the securities documents could have been important or significant to an investor\" was admissible), with State v. Tenney, 913 P.2d 750, 756 (Utah Ct.App.1996) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse holding that such information is not material under securities lawholding that omission of information about shares held in corporations was material even if the securities were worthless at the timeholding that under certain conditions a bank assumes a duty to disclose facts material to a transactionholding that purely factual material may be withheld from disclosure under exemption 5 if that material would expose the deliberative process of an agencyholding inadmissible expert testimony that included statements that failure to disclose certain enumerated information would be a material omission under utah law that the material actually provided to investors did not meet disclosure requirements under the act and that the agreements at issue were securities under utah law & \n\nadult male; siblings may or may not amount to \"substantial family ties,\u201d and if one of his brothers in San Diego was a citizen, two were not. Although the phone number belonged to Awadallah at a former address, it is hard to see why that matters to the investigation. Whether Awadallah was in fact cooperating was surely as unknown to Agent Plunkett as it was to the district court and as it is to us. As to the \"box-cutter,\u201d the tool is multi-purpose, and Agent Plunkett expressed no view as to why Awadallah had one. 21 . We assume for purposes of this discussion, without deciding, that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from a material witness arrest warrant as well as from a search warrant. See United States v. Marchand, 564 F.2d 983 (2d Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>) (citation omitted). 22 . In arguing that a holding that where an arrest was premised on both legally and illegally obtained evidence the validity of the arrest would depend on whether the untainted information considered by itself establishes probable causeholding that the validity of the arrest does not depend on whether the suspect actually committed a crime the mere fact that the subject is later acquitted of the offense for which he is arrested is irrelevant to the validity of the arrestholding in the alternative that even if handcuffing a suspect did convert the detention into an arrest the arrest was justified by probable causeholding that arrest was unsupported by probable cause but granting qualified immunity to defendants who made the arrest in reliance on communications with other officersholding that hearsay evidence is considered valuable evidence in testing probable cause to arrest & \n\nunder the Fourth Amendment. III. CONCLUSION For these reasons, we hold that probable cause to arrest the appellant did not grow stale. Accordingly, his seizure did not violate the Fourth Amendment, and the circuit court did not err in denyi asive authority to support his argument that probable cause to arrest for an observed offense dissipates based merely on the passage of time. 6 . The Supreme Court of Virginia reached a similar conclusion in a case involving a search warrant for blood and hair samples. See Johnson v. Commonwealth, 259 Va. 654, 529 S.E.2d 769 (2000). The Court tested the warrant \"for 'staleness\u2019 by considering whether the facts alleged ... provided probable cause to believe, at the time the search actually was conducted,\u201d that it \"would lead to the 1 (1996) (<HOLDING>). 8 . On the facts of this case, we need not holding that probable cause to believe certain individuals were members of a conspiracy did not give probable cause to search the contents of the room in which they were arrestedholding that probable cause did not fade away merely because the police arrested the defendant the following dayholding that the police officers had probable cause to make a warrantless entryholding that even though the plaintiff was incarcerated for only one day before his extradition hearing the complaint was sufficient to establish a due process violation at the pleadings stage because it alleged among other things that the defendants falsely arrested the plaintiff without probable cause and with deliberate indifference to the plaintiffs rightsholding that probable cause to stop a vehicle was supported by the fact that the defendant had previously been arrested for illegally transporting liquor & \n\nhave moved for summary judgment does not permit the entry of a summary judgment if disputes remain as to material facts. However, cross motions for summary judgments do authorize the court to assume that there is no evidence which needs to be considered other than that which has been filed by the parties. Harrison W. Corp. v. Gulf Oil Co., 662 F.2d 690, 692 (10th Cir.1981) (citations omitted). See Sec. & Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Am. Commodity Exch., Inc., 546 F.2d 1361, 1366 (10th Cir.1976)(\u201c[F]iling of cross-motions under Rule 56, F.R. Civ. P. raises the inference that there is no evidence other than the pleadings and supporting instruments to be considered, and so the trial court need only examine those materials in ascertaining whether an issue of material fact exists.\u201d (8th Cir.1996)(<HOLDING>). \u201cThe district court has discretion to go holding that the district court has no affirmative obligation to plumb the record to procure material factsholding that a failure to advise even when the defendant has an affirmative obligation to do so is not the same as engaging in affirmative misconduct holding state has affirmative duty to disclose favorable and material evidence to defenseholding that the court has an affirmative obligation to ensure that it is acting within the scope of its jurisdictional authorityholding that the court had no obligation to search large record extract & \n\neither be on the persons of the assailants or about the premises where they lived.\u201d). Second, Chambers argues that the police exceeded their authority under the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act, 42 Pa. Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 8953, thereby invalidating the search warrant, because the shooting occurred in Harrisburg, was investigated by Harrisburg police, and Harrisburg police obtained the search warrant, but the warrant was approved by a Swatara magistrate and executed in Swatara Township. Even if Chambers\u2019s interpretation of the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act were correct, however, he does not explain how a violation of state law would be relevant to the federal constitutional analysis required here. Cf Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 176-78, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008) (<HOLDING>). Finally, Chambers\u2019s argument that the holding that warrantless arrest based on probable cause did not violate the fourth amendmentholding that a warrantless arrest on probable cause does not violate the fourth amendment even if state law required the police to have prior authorizationholding that a search incident to a lawful arrest does not violate the fourth amendmentholding that arrest in backyard violated fourth amendmentholding that state law is immaterial for fourth amendment search analysis and refusing to suppress evidence obtained illegally under state law after warrantless arrest because the arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone and as we have just concluded it is not the province of the fourth amendment to enforce state law that amendment does not require the exclusion of evidence obtained from a constitutionally permissible arrest & \n\n"}

In a similar vein, Debtors also maintain rights that were bargained for under the Mortgage. See [Claim No. 11-1, Ex. 1]. The Mortgage allows Debtors to prepay the Mortgage without a prepayment penalty. Id. at 6. Specifically, the Mortgage provides that the payments will be due on or before the first day of each month \u201ccontinuing consecutively until April 1, 2022 when the entire unpaid balance of principal and interest shall become due ankr.

Gen. Stat. \u00a7 25-3-203(a) (2009). Production of an original note at trial does not, in itself, establish that the note was transferred to the party presenting the note with the purpose of giving that party the right to enforce the instrument, as demonstrated in Connolly, 63 N.C.

The lender foreclosed on both deeds, but only obtained confirmation of the sale under the second deed.

As a matter of law, however, when a tenant \u201cmerely retains the keys to the premises,\u201d the tenant does not become a holdover tenant. See Restatement (Second) of Prop.: Landlord & Tenant \u00a7 14.2, Reporter\u2019s Note to Section 14.2, Note 6 (1977). If a tenant retains the keys to the premises, the court must examine the circumstances in their totality, looking to other factors to determine if the tenant should be deemed a holdover tenant.

Countrywide seeks summary judgment as to plaintiff William Croye\u2019s claims in Count IV. Inasmuch as Mr. Croye did not execute the loans at issue, Countrywide contends that he does not meet the definition of a \u201cconsumer\u201d under \u00a7 46A-2-122(a) of the WVCCPA wherein the term is defined as \u201cany natural person obligated or allegedly obligated to pay any debt,\u201d and, thus, has no standing to bring a claim of illegal debt collection under \u00a7 46A-2-128. While it is unlikely that Mr. Croye was ever legally obligated to pay the mortgage loans, plaintiffs have established a question of fact as to whether Mr. Croye was allegedly obligated to pay. See Arnold, v. Palmer, 224 W.Va. 495, 686 S.E.2d 725 (2009) (<HOLDING>). Mr. Croye claims that Countrywide telephoned holding that fraudulent collection on promissory note was reasonably related to breach of contract claimholding that a promissory note is not enforceable against a party who signed the deed of trust but did not sign the promissory note inasmuch as promissory notes and deeds of trust are separate legal documents with unique purposesholding that when note and deed of trust were null and void and of no legal effect because of forgery assignee of note and deed of trust nevertheless had equitable lien upon property for value of construction work for which note and deed of trust were givenholding that mers is capable of being a valid beneficiary of a deed of trust and that while entitlement to enforce both the deed of trust and the promissory note is required to foreclose nothing requires those documents to be unified from the point of inception of the loanholding that when the basis of the earlier suit was that the plaintiff had had defaulted on a promissory note and the claim in the instant action is whether that promissory note was valid the transaction test is met & \n\nWL 1468435, at *3 (S.D.Ohio Mar. 30, 2015) (\"Upon default and the acceleration of the loan, the maturity date advances and any subsequent payment is no longer considered a voluntary prepayment.

Second, even if the trial court had the authority to declare the Association\u2019s lien superior to the mortgage lien as a sanction, the fact remains that the issue of lien priority was never actually litigated. See Goodman v. Aldrich & Ramsey Enters., Inc., 804 So.2d 544, 547 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002) (providing that for collateral estoppel to apply, the issue \u201cmust have been actually litigated\u201d). Nor would it change the fact that PNC Bank, as the holder of the mortgage who obtained title to the subject property via foreclosure sale, qualified as a first mortgagee regardless of the fact that the Association\u2019s assessment lien survived the foreclosure action. See Beltway Capital, LLC v. Greens GOA Inc., 153 So.3d 330, 333 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014) (<HOLDING>).

Since the De Laurentiis decision, a majority of courts considering the issue have extended its reasoning to the chapter 13 context and have held that a creditor\u2019s right to set off is not extinguished by confirmation of the plan under \u00a7 1327. See In re Whitaker, 173 B.R. 359, 362-63 (Bankr.S.D.Ohio 1994); In re Womack, 188 B.R. 259, 261-62 (Bankr.E.D.Ark.1995); In re Orlinski, 140 B.R. 600, 603-4 (Bankr.S.D.Ga.1991).

Our Supreme Court held \u201cthat when changing a group policy insuring contributing employees and obtaining the applications of those employees, the employer acts as an agent of the employees [cits.], and as such is under a duty to notify the employees of differences between the old and new policies and of any rights the employees may have to continue the old insurance on an individual basis. We hold further that where this duty is breached, an employee can recover such damages as result from the difference in coverage.\u201d Id. at 535-536.

Here, Libner does not allege that he directly notified the Association of the existence of the lien. He asserts that the Association should have been on notice as a result of his relationship with his client, his communications with the Association on behalf of that client, and the Association\u2019s receipt of a copy of a letter Libner sent to his client indicating that he had a right to recover his fees. [\u00b6 11] Without deciding whether, and in what circumstance, an attorney may impose a lien against the fund of the opposing party or its carriers, we conclude that no lien may be imposed without direct and specific notice to the carrier or fund that a lien is asserted before the proceeds are disbursed.

In rejecting Scott\u2019s claim of constructive discharge and accepting Harris\u2019s claim of resignation, the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that a salary in the reduced amount of $150,000 could not be deemed so abusive as to render continued employment untenable.

Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in holding that substantial evidence supported the bias determination that a lebanese petitioner persecuted in the late 1990s for antisyrian views had failed to show a probability he would be tortured if returned to lebanon after the syrian militarys withdrawal from lebanon and the emergence of an antihezbollah majority in the legislatureholding that the state failed to meet its burden when the record failed to show that the jurors would or would not be available after a weeks continuanceholding that a defendant must show reasonable probability that but for the error he would not have entered the pleaholding that substantial evidence supported determination that petitioners failed to show that fear of sterilization was objectively reasonableholding that to show prejudice in a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel the petitioner must show a reasonable probability that but for counsels errors the result of the proceeding would have been different & \n\nwho \u201cmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927. Like an award made pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent power, an award under \u00a7 1927 is proper when the attorney\u2019s actions are so plainly without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose. See, e.g., Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d 1265, 1273 (2d Cir.1986) (police photographs of client taken an hour after incident in which police officers allegedly employed excessive force in taking client into custody did not constitute such clear evidence of absence of excessive force to render client\u2019s attorney liable for his adversary\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a result of bad faith); Acevedo v.

Based on the facts before the Court at this time, these unliquidated, contingent, and disputed claims should be given no greater weight for COMI purposes than any of the Debtors\u2019 other substantial litigations relating to assets that are pending in Ireland and the BVI. In any proceeding for foreign recognition, of great concern to the Court is the potential for mischief and COMI manipulation, as recently expressed by the Fifth Circuit in In re Ran, 607 F.3d 1017, 2010 WL 2106638, at *8 (<HOLDING>). Thus, even courts that have recently holding that to reopen a case an alien must show that the new evidence would likely change the resultrecognizing in dicta that the case before it involving an individual and not an entity did not involve a recent change of domicile by the party in question and a similar case brought immediately after the partys arrival in the united states following a long period of domicile in the country where the bankruptcy is pending would likely lead to a different resultholding that in the context of a challenge to a states lethal injection protocol the mere possibility of a trial date in another case involving similar issues does not affect the balancing of the equities in this caseholding that a change in personal circumstances in the united states does not constitute a change in country conditions and therefore does not establish an exception to the filing deadline for motions to reopenrecognizing a change in domicile based on the principle a guardian of an incompetent person acting in good faith has the rightto permanently change the wards domicile to another jurisdiction unless the court having control over the ward objects & \n\nORDER Petitioner Beniamino Baldi, a native and citizen of Italy, seeks review of the June 7, 2011, order of the BIA denying his motion to reopen. In re Beniamino Baldi, No. A012 099 608 (B.I.A. June 7, 2011). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case. While we generally lack jurisdiction to review a final order of removal issued against an alien, such as Baldi, who was found removable by reason of having committed an aggravated felony, we retain jurisdiction to review colorable constitutional claims or questions of law. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C), (D); Durant v. INS, 393 F.3d 113, 115 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). Baldi argues that the BIA abused its holding that court of appeals statutory jurisdiction over final orders of removal extends to reinstatement ordersrecognizing that both final and nonfinal orders may be the subject of motions for reconsiderationholding that there are two standards in review of orders on motions to vacate defaults simple abuse of discretion for orders denying relief and gross abuse of discretion for orders granting reliefholding that orders remanding an action to a federal agency are generally not considered final appealable ordersrecognizing that orders denying motions to reopen are treated as final orders of removal & \n\nCURIAM: Jose Rodriguez Rueda petitions this court for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) decision summarily affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) order denying his application for cancellation of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l). Rueda contests the merits o 999) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, this court lacks jurisdiction to holding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the discretionary denial of cancellation of removal based on a lack of exceptional and extremely unusual hardshiprecognizing that the iirira strips the court of jurisdiction over the attorney generals discretionary extreme hardship determination but retaining jurisdiction over constitutional due process claimsholding that the transitional rules preclude direct judicial review of the bias discretionary determination of extreme hardship in suspension of deportation casesholding under the predecessor to 1229bb that denials of suspension based on the element of extreme hardship are discretionary decisionsholding that discretionary denials of motions to reopen are reviewed only for abuse of that discretion & \n\nthat would arise if we were to affirm a removal order on a ground introduced only on appeal and not raised or litigated below, see Alvarez-Santos v. INS, 332 F.3d 1245, 1252 (9th Cir.2003), the government\u2019s argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of our review. Whatever the grounds on which Al Mutarreb might have been found removable, only one was charged. We have no power to affirm the BIA on a ground never charged by the Service or found by the IJ. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (noting that a \u201ccourt is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate and proper basis\u201d not relied on by the agency); see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Nor do we accept the government\u2019s contention holding that when an ij issues a decision granting an aliens application for withholding of removal without a grant of asylum the decision must include an explicit order of removal designating a country of removalholding proof of possession of stolen goods is sufficient evidence to sustain conviction for theftholding that term order of removal does not include aliens ineffective assistance of counsel claim concerning attorneys actions taken after order of removal becomes finalholding that the defendants prior drug conviction for simple possession did not constitute a controlled substance offense because the plain language of 4b12b requires that the prior conviction involve possession with intent to distributeholding that an aliens prior possession conviction cannot sustain the removal order because it was not alleged in the nta & \n\na spouse or parent who is a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident; (2) has been continuously physically present in the United States for at least three years; (3) has been a person of good moral character during such period; (4) is not inadmissible due to the commission of specified crimes; and (5) establishes that removal would result in extreme hardship to the alien, his child, or to his parent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2) (2006); Stepanovic v. Filip, 554 F.3d 673, 677 n. 4 (7th Cir.2009). In an appeal of an administrative decision to grant or deny cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b), this court has jurisdiction only over constitutional claims and questions of law. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i), (D) (2006); see Jean v.

Moreover, Section 1252(b)(1) states that \u201c[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under [\u00a7 1252(a)(1) ], ... [t]he petition for review must be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Prior to the enactment of the REAL ID Act, a non-criminal alien could seek judicial review of the BIA\u2019s decision through either (i) a petition for review, which was required to be filed within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s issuance of its final order of removal, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), or (ii) a habeas corpus petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, for which there was no time limit. See Luya Liu v. INS, 293 F.3d 36, 41 (2d Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). On May 11, 2005, Congress enacted the REAL ID holding that noncriminal aliens could seek review of the agencys orders through either a petition for review or a 2241 petitionholding that an aliens express waiver of his right to appeal to the bia deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider the aliens subsequent petition for reviewholding that the real id act gave us jurisdiction to review a criminal aliens petition for review of an order of removal raising a question of lawholding that if defendant could establish ineffective assistance of counsel in failure to file petition for review in his direct appeal then appropriate remedy would be to allow filing of petition for review out of timeholding that review under 2241 still available notwithstanding express language in iirira barring review by any court of final orders of removal for aliens deportable by reason of having committed a criminal offense and distinguishing between direct and collateral review & \n\n\u2018in custody\u2019 for the purposes of the habeas petition. Critical to the disposition of this issue is the principle held in Nakaranurack v. United States, 68 F.3d 290 (9th Cir.1995). There, the Ninth Circuit stated: We have broadly construed \u201cin custody\u201d to apply to situations in which an alien is not suffering any actual physical detention; i.e., so long as he is subject to a final order of deportation, an alien is deemed to be \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of the INA, and therefore may petition a district court for habeas review. Numerous cases have cited the above principle with approval \u2014 and while the context of those cases may vary; the principle remains the same \u2014 even in spite of the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of Congress. See, Simmonds v. INS, 326 F.3d 351, 354 (2d Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Ramos-Birueta v. INS, 2000 WL 1359593 at *1 holding that a final order of removal is sufficient by itself to establish the requisite custodyholding that review of an original removal decision and a subsequent removal order are distinctholding that the farr act is expressly limited to claims arising out of a final order of removal and does not confer any legal rights outside of the removal settingholding that the lower court should have entered a final order on custodyholding that term order of removal does not include aliens ineffective assistance of counsel claim concerning attorneys actions taken after order of removal becomes final & \n\nfor review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s removal order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.

Ashcroft, 335 F.Sd 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that the government met its burden of showing Valenzuela abandoned her lawful permanent resident status because the record does not compel the conclusion that she consistently intended promptly to return to the United States. See Singh v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); see also Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, 792 F.2d 932, holding that the rule 404b evidence admitted to prove intent was clearly relevant because intent was at issue in the trialholding that the relevant intent is not the intent to return ultimately but the intent to return to the united states within a relatively short periodholding that where congressional intent is clear a court must give effect to such intentholding that the only showing of intent required for a vcea claim is the intent to do the act involvedholding that removal for temporary employment with intent to return was not abandonment & \n\nwould be future restrictions on his ability to reenter the United States, nor informed of any right to retain counsel. His counsel stated that the expedited removal order was invalid and improper inasmuch as Shunaula had possessed a valid visa at the time of his 1997 entry. The IJ concluded that he was not in a position to entertain a collateral attack on the 1997 expedited removal order. The IJ ruled that Shunaula was (1) inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(9)(C)(i)(II), which renders inadmissible any alien who enters the United States illegally after having been ordered removed pursuant to, inter alia, an order of expedited removal; and therefore (2) ineligible for adjustment of status. See IJ Decision at 5-6, Admin. R. 65-66 (citing Delgado v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 65 (2d Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>)). On appeal to the BIA, Shunaula pressed the holding that a district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction under the apa to review the denial of an aliens application for adjustment of status where the alien is in removal proceedingsholding that aliens inadmissible under 1182a 9c i i are ineligible for adjustment of status under 1255fholding that refugees who have already acquired lpr status are ineligible for a 209c waiver in light of the language in that adjustment of status can be granted to an alien who has not acquired permanent resident statusholding ineligible for adjustment of status alien who was inadmissible due to reentry after prior removalrecognizing that an alien is ineligible for relief under 212c if he was not actually admissible at the time he received an adjustment of status & \n\nremoval and for relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the denial of asylum for substantial evidence and may reverse only if the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. Lata v. INS, 204 F.3d 1241, 1244-45 (9th Cir.2000). We deny the petition. Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that petitioner failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Any mistreatment that petitioner received from his classmates at school who harassed him in a \u2018joking way\u2019 and pressured him to join the Shining Path did not rise to the level of past persecution or establish a well-founded fear of future persecution. See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (<HOLDING>); Nagoulko v.

Because there is no evidence that the BIA reviewed the petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding claim, as requested by petitioners in their brief to the BIA, pursuant to the disfavored group analysis set forth in Sael v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004), we remand to the agency to determine Sael\u2019s application in this case. See INS v.

In Israel, after the prosecutor made a motion for competency determination, the trial judge did not appoint any experts to examine the defendant. Id. at 775. Instead, the court proceeded to ask questions of the defendant and allowed the prosecutor to question her. Id. Defense counsel asked no questions hut asked that the court find her competent at the close of the perfunctory examination. Id. at 775-76. While the court acknowledged that \u201cthe Washington statute . . . speak[s] in mandatory language,\u201d id. at 777, it held that the \u201cstatutory requirement that two experts be appointed to examine a defendant is not a constitutional right but is statutory and may be waived by counsel.\u201d Id. at 779; see also State v.

App. at 391,394, 533 S.E.2d at 560, 562. In this case, defendant\u2019s competence has never been assessed, let alone at a relevant time. Thus, it is clear that a retrospective determination of defendant\u2019s competence would not be possible here and we do not need to remand for the trial court to make such a determination. Because defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial has never been evaluated and \u201c[g]iven the inherent difficulties of such a nunc pro tunc determination under the most favorable circumstances, we cannot conclude that such a procedure would be adequate here.\u201d Drope, 420 U.S. at 183, 43 L.Ed. 2d at 119-20 (citations omitted); see also Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 403, 4 L.Ed. 2d 824, 825 (1960) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reverse defendant\u2019s holding that appellant must present some evidence of a subsequent change in competency or some new evidence in a manner analogous to newly discovered evidence in a motion for new trial to complain of a denial of a second competency hearingrecognizing the difficulty of retrospectively determining the defendants competency as of more than a year ago and ordering a new trial and hearing as to the defendants present competenceholding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the state does not have to prove a defendants competency to stand trialholding that a trial court must conduct sua sponte a competency hearing when the information known to the trial court at the time of the trial or plea is sufficient to raise a bona fide doubt regarding the defendants competence & \n\nto determine the defendant's competence to waive the right to counsel). Specifically, a defendant is competent to waive the right to counsel if he has \"sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding{[ ] and ... has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\" Dusky, 362 U.S. at 402, 80 S.Ct. 788. 117 If a trial court finds that a defendant fails to meet this standard, then the defendant may not waive the right to counsel. See Godinez, 509 U.S. at 399, 118 S.Ct. 2680. If the defendant satisfies the Dusky competency standard, however, he may waive the right to counsel if his waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent. Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94; see also Faretta, 422 U.S. at 807, 95 S.Ct. 2525 (<HOLDING>). 118 A \"voluntary\" waiver, like any voluntary holding that a criminal defendant has a constitutional right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do soholding that accused must competently and intelligently waive the right to counselholding that one must voluntarily and intelligently waive the right to counselrecognizing that the sixth amendment guarantees a defendant the right to counsel and the right to waive counselholding that the defendants guilty plea was entered into knowingly voluntarily and intelligently & \n\nvalidity of the conviction is at issue, but because the jury needs to examine the circumstances of the offense (as well as any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or prior record) in order to decide intelligently the question of punishment. It is not error to inform the resentencing jury that the defendant has already been found guilty, and to tell the jury that its duty is to determine the punishment to be imposed, considering \u201call of the evidence\u201d presented at the resentencing trial, and \u201call of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d Transcript, Vol. 41 at 2851, 2857-59. See Alderman v. State, supra at 212 (11 b). 14. Potts complains of the state\u2019s use of a prior conviction for murder based on a guilty plea that was not shown to be voluntary. See Pope v. State, supra at 195 (17) (<HOLDING>). Potts raised before trial the issue of holding that once the defendant raises the issue of intelligent and voluntary waiver with respect to prior guilty pleas the burden is on the state to establish a valid waiverholding that record did not show voluntary or intelligent waiverrecognizing that the burden to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional right is upon the prosecutionholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nprocess to convict a defendant when he is legally incompetent. United States v. Mason, 52 F.3d 1286, 1289 (4th Cir.1995). \u201cCongress has safeguarded this [due process] right by providing that trial courts conduct competency hearings\u201d under specified circumstances. Id. (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4241(a)). Of relevance here, when neither party to a criminal trial moves for a competency hearing, the district court shall order such a hearing on its own motion[ ] if there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant may presently be suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him mentally incompetent to the extent that he is unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense. \u00a7 4241(a); see also Mason, 52 F.3d at 1289 (<HOLDING>). Whether such reasonable cause exists, holding that the existence of probable cause in a 1983 case is a jury questionrecognizing the existence of the special relationshiprecognizing the cause of actionrecognizing that the existence of reasonable cause requires the sua sponte ordering of a competency hearingrecognizing cause of action & \n\ndisorder, bipolar affective disorder, and recurrent major depressive disorder does not automatically entitle him to a competency hearing especially since his most recent evaluations attest to his competency. Given our evaluation of the weight due to the various psychiatrists\u2019 reports, we find that the Court has sufficient evidence to make a determination regarding the defendant\u2019s competence without further proceedings. The stipulations filed by the government and defense counsel regarding defendant\u2019s competence provide a complete picture of the defendant\u2019s mental state and demeanor. Here, both parties were given a chance to provide what evidence they deemed appropriate to determine the defendant\u2019s competence. See United States v. O\u2019Neal, 969 F.2d 512, 514 (7th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). This Court holds that a competency hearing is holding that the trial court need not hold a voluntariness hearing where the defendant did not object and no evidence presented raised the issueholding that the district court did in effect hold a hearing when it gave the defense a chance to supplement a psychiatric report with further evidenceholding after remand that where the opposing party thus raises a material dispute as to the admissibility of expert scientific evidence the district court must hold an in limine hearing a socalled daubert hearing to consider the conflicting evidence holding that the lower court was not required to hold a hearing on a motion to transferholding that court did not have to hold a hearing to determine attorneys fees where detailed affidavit was provided & \n\nIf the defendant perceives the connection between his crime and his punishment, the retributive goal of the criminal law is satisfied, and only if the defendant is aware that his death is approaching can he prepare himself for his passing. Accordingly, I would hold that the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution only of those who are unaware of the punishment they are about to suffer and why they are to suffer it. See Garrett v. Collins, 951 F.2d 57, 59 (5th Cir.1992) and Lowenfield v. Butler, 843 F.2d 183, 187 (5th Cir.1988) (both quoting and relying on this excerpt from Justice Powell\u2019s concurrence in Ford, 477 U.S. at 422, 106 S.Ct. 2595 (Powell, J., concurring), in denying competency-to-be-executed habeas relief); see also Fearance, 56 F.3d at 640 and Barnard, 13 F.3d at 876 n. 2 (<HOLDING>). Counsel for Panetti suggests this Court holding that competency standard for stand ing trial is same as standard for determining competency to waive right to counselholding that the standard for determining competency to plead guilty is whether the defendant has a rational understanding of the proceedingsholding that the fifth circuit has adopted the powell concurrence as the standard for competency to be executedholding that no exception to the invited error doctrine has ever been adopted by this circuitholding competency standard for pleading guilty or waiving right to counsel is same as competency standard for standing trial and disapproving contrary holding of masthers & \n\nincludes the concomitantrightto waive counsel\u2019s assistance and proceed to represent oneself at criminal proceedings.

In Pennsylvania, Rule of Criminal Procedure 121 sets out a framework for inquiry into a defendant\u2019s request for self-representation. Pa.R.Crim.P. 121.

Rather, because Kleiner\u2019s opinion does not proffer any specialized knowledge, and invokes legal standards (\u25a0ie., that defendants could have accommodated plaintiffs disability without significant impact, and that defendants retaliated against plaintiff), his opinion would \u201cnot aid the jury in making a decision, but rather attempts to substitute [his] judgment for the jury\u2019s.\u201d See United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97, 102 (2d Cir.1994) (\u201cWhen this occurs, the expert acts outside of his limited role of providing the groundwork in the form of an opinion to enable the jury to make its own informed determination.\u201d); see also Hygh v.

Of course, it could be said that Clark can hardly complain about the district court\u2019s grant of his own motion. But, because the court\u2019s discretion to deny a request for self-representation requires the court to consider the defendant\u2019s interest, I would conclude that a defendant who makes such a motion, against the advice of or without the support of his appointed counsel ke a searching inquiry of Clark\u2019s reasons for wanting to dismiss his present counsel. , On their face, Clark\u2019s claims that counsel had not visited him in jail, had not discussed the case with him, would not seek out suggested witnesses, and would not have the gun checked for fingerprints, raised serious questions that required inquiry. See, e.g., United States v. Morrissey, 461 F.2d 666, 669 (2d Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The majority suggests that Clark\u2019s claims do holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to substitute counsel on the strength of gonzalezs sworn responses at the pleataking that no one was threatening him or forcing him to plead where the defendant alleged that his attorney forced him to plead guilty and threatened him if he did not take the pleaholding even when a request for an attorney is ambiguous it is incumbent upon law enforcement to seek clarification of the ambiguity before denying the statutory right to counselholding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding that an ambiguous mention of an attorney is not a request for counselholding that a defendants claim that his attorney did not meet with him or seek out witnesses required a searching inquiry before denying the request for new counsel & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\ndefendants. Id. at 615, 117 S.Ct. 2231. Hence, the district court must engage in a rigorous analysis of whether the Rule\u2019s requirements have actually been met. Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160-61, 102 S.Ct. 2364, 72 L.Ed.2d 740 (1982). At times the issues may be plain enough for the court to make its determina tion only on the pleadings. If need be, however, the district court may probe behind the pleadings and forecast what kind of evidence may be required or allowed at trial. See id. Of course, the court must bear in mind that plaintiffs are not required to prove their case at the certification stage. Thus, certification is not an appropriate time to examine the merits. Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 178, 94 S.Ct. 2140, 40 L.Ed.2d 732 (1974) (<HOLDING>); In re Visa Check\/MasterMoney Antitrust holding that while it is not appropriate to consider the merits in determining certification the admissibility of all evidence which has relevance to the merits is not barred if it is relevant to the purpose of refuting or supporting the existence of a classholding that the court has no authority to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the merits of an action to determine whether it may be maintained as a class actionholding certification is not an occasion for inquiry into the meritsholding that an employers inquiry into the reason for an employees work absences was a permissible jobrelated inquiry under the adaholding that the court may only make a facial inquiry into the validity of the certification & \n\nin this case. See Ronald Lature McCray v. State, No. 02C01-9412-CC-00277, 1995 WL 568388 (Tenn.Crim.App., at Jackson, September 27, 1995); George Cheairs v.

State, this court made the following observation: If the parties can agree that a defendant be sentenced to a term of years exceeding the maximum for his range, then logically by agreement he could be sentenced to a term less than the minimum. The release eligibility date would then be determined by agreement rather than the Range. Thus, the statutory ranges and the corresponding release eligibility percentages would be virtually meaningless, with sentencing structure governed by contract rather than by statute.

Statutes providing for forfeiture of driving privileges or punishment for habitual violations of the traffic statutes are designed to protect the public from persons who have demonstrated that they are unable to obey traffic laws established for the safety of citizens and that their driving presents a hazard to life and property. See Owens v. State (1978), 178 Ind.App. 406, 382 N.E.2d 1312, 1314-1315. The absence of limiting language in L.C. 9-30-10-16 reveals the legislature's recognition that the danger to the public is equally as great on private property used by the public, such as shopping center parking lots and apartment complex roads, as it is on public highways. See Huey v. State (1987), Ind.App., 503 N.E.2d 623, 626-627 (<HOLDING>).

The Ratchford exception is limited to an oral grant of a new trial being effective to defeat automatic denial provisions built into the rules of criminal procedure. 115 N.M. at 570-71, 855 P.2d at 559-60. The cases involving discharge of a jury can be distinguished because in those cases the proceedings were terminated and the fact-finder was discharged by the oral comments of the judge, while here, proceedings were ongoing and the court expressly reserved ruling on the aggravated DWI charge. Rodriguez, 2004-NMCA-125, \u00b6 14, 136 N.M. 494, 100 P.3d 200 (<HOLDING>); Reyes-Arreola, 1999-NMCA-086, \u00b6 10, 127 N.M. holding part performance of an oral agreement necessary to take the oral agreement out of the statute of frauds must be consistent only with the existence of the alleged oral contractholding that a delinquency proceeding places a juvenile in jeopardy for purposes of the double jeopardy clauseholding that oral declarations of mistrial which discharge the jury are unlike other oral decisions by the trial court which are not binding and are subject to change until a final written order or judgment is enteredholding that defendant did not breach oral agreement because among other things the plaintiff had not established that the term in question was part of the oral contractholding that oral discharge of jury terminated jeopardy & \n\nCURIAM. Petitioner Thomas Alfred Brydon appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition for relief. We affirm. Brydon pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture methamphetamine. At sentencing, the district court applied the career-offender provisions of United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 & 4B1.2. The court determined that four prior Iowa convictions for operating a motor vehicle without the owner\u2019s consent and one prior Iowa conviction for operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated qualified as predicate crimes of violence. Subsequently, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Begay v. United States, 553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) (<HOLDING>). Later, in United States v. Steward, 598 F.3d holding a felony conviction for driving while intoxicated dwi may be a crime of violenceholding for the purposes of 18 usc 924e that being a felon in possession of a firearm is not a violent felony as defined in 18 usc 924e2bholding that statute prohibiting driving while intoxicated applied to defendant driving on a private parking lotholding that driving while intoxicated is not a violent felony pursuant to 18 usc 924e2bholding that burglary is violent felony & \n\ndeclined to provide a breath sample. At some point during or after the booking process, appellant complained of chest and wrist pain, so the police called for an ambulance. The trial court found appellant guilty of DWI, and this appeal followed. Sufficiency of the Evidence In his sole issue, appellant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to support his DWI conviction. A. Standard of Review When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict to determine whether any rational fact finder could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); Adames v. State, 353 S.W.3d 854, 859 (Tex.Crim.App.2011) (<HOLDING>). Our review of \u201call of the evidence\u201d includes holding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that appellate court could not review the sufficiency of the evidence based on a particular legal standard because that standard was not submitted to the jury and no party objected to the charge on this ground or requested that the jury be charged using this standardholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdictholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\n\u201cprotracted\u201d is \u201cto draw out or lengthen in time; prolong.\u201d Id. Following the same logic, we held in Fleming v. State that the word \u201cimpairment\u201d means \u201c[t]he fact or state of being damaged, weakened, or diminished\u201d for purposes of the aggravated battery statute. 833 N.E.2d 84, 89 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). Smith argues that Officer Wheeler\u2019s injury cannot fall under the second prong of the aggravated battery statute because \u201cthe tooth was neither a bodily member or organ.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. p. 8. While there is no Indiana precedent for the notion that a tooth is a bodily member or organ for purposes of our aggravated battery statute, several other jurisdictions have analyzed similar statutes and arrived at that conclusion. See, e.g., Rivers v. State, 255 Ga.App. 422, 565 S.E.2d 596, 597 (2002) (<HOLDING>); McBeath v. State, 739 So.2d 451, 455 holding that the evidence is sufficient to sustain a conviction for aggravated battery when the bodily member that is lost or rendered useless in the battery is a toothholding that aggravated battery of peace officer encompasses both insulting or provoking contact and battery resulting in bodily harmholding that tooth was a member and loss of tooth consti tuted serious bodily injury for purposes of aggravated battery statuteholding that aggravated battery is a lesser included offense of manslaughterholding that battery is an inherently included offense of aggravated battery & \n\na record cannot qualify as a business record if it was prepared for purposes of litigation. See, e.g., United States v. Feliz, 467 F.3d 227, 234 (2d Cir.2006). But where a document is created primarily for the government to use it as a substitute for live testimony in a criminal prosecution, the fact that the document might happen to fall within the jurisdiction\u2019s business records exception to the hearsay rule does not render the document non-testimonial. Accordingly, because DEA chemist\u2019s reports are created expressly for use in criminal prosecutions as a substitute for live testimony against the accused, such reports are testimonial, whether or not they happen to meet this jurisdiction\u2019s definition of a business record. See State v. Caulfield, 722 N.W.2d 304, 309-10 (Minn.2006) (<HOLDING>).

Coronado, 603 F.3d at 708. We held it was not, because the state statute \u201conly requires gross negligence, and crimes with a mens rea of gross negligence or recklessness do not satisfy Begay\u2019s requirement of \u2018purposeful\u2019 conduct.\u201d Id. at 710. Arguably, our decision in Coronado contains language suggesting that only crimes involving specific intent satisfy Begay\u2019s \u201cpurposeful\u201d requirement. See id. at 711. There, we noted that in \u201cother contexts\u201d we have defined \u201cpurposeful\u201d as \u201cdone with a specific purpose in mind; DELIBERATE.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).

Individual Liability Wilson alleges claims of race discrimination pursuant to Title VII, the ELCRA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against Budco and Raymond. As Wilson conceded during a hearing on the motion, an individual who does not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d is not subject to individual liability under Title VII. Wathen v. General Elec. Co., 115 F.3d 400, 405 (6th Cir.1997) (\u201cWe now hold that an individual employee\/supervisor, who does not otherwise qualify as an \u2018employer\u2019 may not be held personally liable under Title VIL\u201d). Individual liability may, however, be imposed pursuant to \u00a7 1981 and the ELCRA. See Whidbee v.

To justify an offense level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), the district court had to find that Defendant possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d The additional felony offense identified by the district court, in this case, was kidnapping. See Cummings v. State, 968 P.2d 821, 832 (Okla.Crim.App.1998) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

Whether, in this particular case, this interest is substantial enough to be regarded as a \u201cprotected interest\u201d under the Due Process Clause \u2014 a question which we need not answer \u2014 the interest does not appear to be as significant as, for example, the loss of income or public-assistance benefits. See, e.g., Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). Accordingly, Perry\u2019s interest does not weigh heavily in the Mathews v. Eldridge balancing test, and certainly it weighs less heavily than the state\u2019s interest. As to the final relevant factor under Mathews v. Eldridge, there is little risk of an erroneous deprivation of an individual\u2019s asserted intere Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>); Sabree v.

In felony murder cases where the felony is a first-degree felony such a presumption is appropriate, but not where the felony is of a lesser degree. This presumption is inappropriate today for lesser-degree felonies where moral, social, and penal considerations dictate that criminal liability should be imposed according to moral culpability. Thu 494 (1958) (stating that the mere violation of a traffic safety statute is an insufficient predicate for felonious slaying, that it requires \u201crecklessness of probable consequences of a dangerous nature, when tested by the rule of reasonable prevision\u201d); State v.

United States, 550 U.S. 192, 210 n. 6, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007). Campbell hopes that the dissents in those cases will persuade us to find the statute unconstitutionally vague. However, we are bound by the existing precedent to the contrary. Thus, the district court did not err in overruling Campbell\u2019s objection to his sentence based on the alleged vagueness of the ACCA. Campbell also argues that his previous convictions for third-degree burglary and fourth-degree aggravated assault are not violent felonies under the ACCA, in order to preserve these issues for further appeal. However, he concedes that we have held to the contrary. See United States v. Coleman, 655 F.3d 480, 482-83 (6th Cir.2011), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1045, 181 L.Ed.2d 768 (2012) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

In its discussion, the court held that first, second, and third degree assault are all general intent crimes, meaning that the actor need only intend the assault, not the injury which results. In State v. Swigart, 233 Neb. 517, 446 N.W.2d 216 (1989), an appeal of the defendant\u2019s first degree assault conviction, the court rejected the defend ant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction because the defendant said he did not intend to cause serious bodily injury. Similarly, Parks claims that he did not intend to hurt the baby or break his leg. The Williams court said that the assault statutes prohibit conduct consisting of acts which cause injury of various seriousness. See, also, State v. Duis, 207 Neb. 851, 301 N.W.2d 587 (1981) (<HOLDING>). The assault statutes, Neb. Rev.

Burgess, 639 N.W.2d 564, 567 (Iowa 2001). The plea only differs from the traditional guilty plea \"in that when a defendant enters an Alford plea, he or she does not admit participation in the acts constituting the crime.\u201d Id. at n. 1. 2 . We acknowledge our decision today is the third within a year that recognizes collateral consequences based on the court\u2019s acceptance of the plea notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s deferred judgment. See Daughenbaugh v.

Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. v. Chapman, 388 N.E.2d 541, 553 (Ind. Ct. App. 1979). The court reasoned that the competency of an expert witness has never been limited to only those facts he or she has learned from personal demonstration. Instead, the court explained, \"where a witness exhibits such a degree of knowledge, gained from experiments, observation, standard books, or other reliable source, as to make it appear that his opinion is of some value, he is entitled to testify.\" Id. Exide cites several cases as support for the proposition that \"mere practical knowledge and frequent use of a product does not qualify the user as an expert on ... warnings.\" However, none of these cases support this proposition. See, e.g., McCullock v. H.B. Fuller Co., 981 F.2d 656 (2nd Cir. 1992) (<HOLDING>); Silva v. American Airlines, Inc., 960 F. holding that warnings given to a witness by the trial court and the prosecutor concerning the possibility that testifying could place the witness in jeopardy of revocation of his plea agreement and charges of perjury or false statement did not violate the defendants due process rights because the warnings merely corroborated in a straightforward and nonthreatening manner the information given by the witness attorneyholding witness was not qualified to opine on the adequacy of the warnings of a specialized glue because he lacked expertise in either the product was not a chemical engineer toxicologist or an environmental engineer or the design of warning labelsholding that district court did not abuse its discretion in excluding testimony of mechanical engineer in products liability case involving automobile because expert did not have specific experience regarding subject matter of lawsuitholding that the shape of a product was not an advertising idea because there was no allegation in the complaint that the design itself was a trademark or was intended to distinguish the product from others that might enter the market citation omittedholding that it was not an abuse of discretion for district court to allow a mechanical engineer to give expert testimony about a machine with which the engineer had no design experience & \n\nEstate of Stephenson, 243 Neb. 890, 503 N.W.2d 540 (1993). In reviewing a question of law, an appellate court reaches a conclusion independent of the lower court\u2019s ruling. In re Estate of Stull, supra, citing Goff-Hamel v. Obstetricians & Gyns., P.C., 256 Neb. 19, 588 N.W.2d 798 (1999). ANALYSIS On appeal, Muff and Lauridsen argue that the county court erred in awarding Thomsen fees because there is no such office as an attorney for an estate and, secondly, because at all times Thomsen was proceeding contrary to Tucker\u2019s expressed desires and wishes. Ordinarily, the right of an attorney to compensation for his or her services depends upon a contract of employment, express or implied. In re Estate of Stull, supra. See, also, Doyle v. Union Ins. Co., 209 Neb. 385, 308 N.W.2d 322 (1981) (<HOLDING>). In Doyle v. Union Ins.

Whether a law enforcement officer reasonably relied upon a subsequently invalidated search warrant is a legal question which we review de novo. See United States v. Koerth, 312 F.3d 862, 865 (7th Cir.2002). A. The Foundations and Purpose of the Exclusionary Rule Simply stated, \u201c[t]he exclusionary rule operates to prevent the Government from using evidence seized as the result of an illegal search in a subsequent criminal prosecution.\u201d United States v. McGough, 412 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2005). It has existed, in some form, as part of our constitutional jurisprudence for over one hundred years. See Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 638, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886) (<HOLDING>). Although commentators have articulated holding statute requiring parties in tax suit to take notice of subsequent pleadings was not unconstitutional when city failed to take such noticeholding that where it was erroneous for the district court to take judicial notice it certainly cannot be said that such notice was mandatory and therefore ire 201d is inapplicableholding that a notice to produce personal papers was unconstitutional and void and that the inspection by the district attorney of said invoice when produced in obedience to said notice and its admission in evidence by the court were erroneous and unconstitutional proceedingsholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitionerholding that a defendant is not entitled to relief from default judgment because notice to an attorney of filing of motions and orders is constructive notice to the client even when the client did not have actual notice & \n\ntrial court to have granted a 30-day grace period, in light of the fact that Schorp\u2019s attorney failed to file an expert report in compliance with the statute\u2019s requirements, would have undermined the statute\u2019s intent. For that reason, appellant\u2019s fourth issue cannot be sustained. Therefore, we overrule appellant's fourth issue. 4 . Bell and Baptist assert relevant questions which a jury would have to consider and would necessitate an expert's opinion: for example, (1) whether the decision to use an arterial line was within the appropriate standard of care; (2)what are the appropriate procedures for an arterial line insertion; (3) what other possible medical causes could exist; (4) what should have been the appropriate medical treatment or intervention? See Haddock, 793 S.W.2d at 953 (<HOLDING>); Odak, 934 S.W.2d at 873 (holding that the holding that affidavit of merit is not required in common knowledge casesrecognizing common knowledge exceptionrecognizing a common knowledge exceptionholding that administering of a hypodermic needle for the purpose of anesthesia was not within laymans common knowledgeholding that a reason to combine may come from the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art the nature of the problem to be solved or common knowledge and common sense & \n\non some unspecified, but earlier date. See id. The Court notes that Plaintiffs do not cite to authority for their proposition that a defendant must \u201cexercise ... ordinary diligence\u201d in determining that a case is removable. See id. Nor has the Court been able to find support for Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that section 1446 requires defendants to exercise ordinary diligence in ferreting out grounds for removal. Rather, a defendant must remove within thirty days from the date on which he \u201creceives actual notice that the case has become removable, which may be communicated in a formal or informal manner.\u201d 14A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 3732, at 520 (emphasis added). See also Bosky v. Kroger Tex., LP, 288 F.3d 208 (5th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). The Court therefore finds that the only holding that the one year limit applies only to removals based on something other than the initial pleading that is only to removals pursuant to the second paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding that a writ of summons alone can no longer be the initial pleading that triggers the 30day period for removal under the first paragraph of 28 usc 1446bholding other paper must be unequivocally clear and certain to start the time limit running for a notice of removal under the second paragraph of section 1446bholding that the information supporting removal in a copy of an amended pleading must be unequivocally clear and certain to start the time limit running for a notice of removal internal quotation omittedholding that removal under the second paragraph of 1446b did not apply and defendants therefore had removed outside of the thirty day time period triggered at the time of service of the complaint & \n\nfiled and it does not matter that all parties were not served within thirty days. AWSD bases its argument on a novel reading of our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Maples v. State, 110 N.M. 34, 791 P.2d 788 (1990). In Maples, the Supreme Court held that on procedural matters such as time limitations for appeals, rules adopted by the Supreme Court governing limitations period for appeal to the judiciary from workers\u2019 compensation deci sions prevail over an inconsistent statute. Id. at 36, 791 P.2d at 790. AWSD argues that Section 72-7-1 is such an inconsistent statute and that AWSD was therefore required to comply only with the requirements set out in Rule 1-074 to perfect its appeal to the district court. But cf. In re Application of Metro. Invs., Inc., 110 N.M. at 440, 796 P.2d at 1136 (<HOLDING>). {7} AWSD admits that it did not make this holding time for filing notice of appeal under rule 8002 is jurisdictionalholding that successive new trial or jnov motions do not toll the time for serving the notice of appealholding that timeliness of filing of notice of appeal is a jurisdictional issueholding that the time limits in the equal access to justice act are jurisdictionalholding that section 7271 statutory provisions specifically dealing with the time limits for serving notice of appeal from decisions of the state engineer were jurisdictional & \n\n1999) (quoting Chitwood, 443 S.W.2d at 830-31) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court entered separate orders of dismissal for the chancery court and circuit court cases. Only one order was appealed. Because consolidated lawsuits remain separate actions, \u201cit logically fol lows that consolidation cannot cure defects in either lawsuit.\u201d Givens v. Vanderbilt Univ., No. M2011-00186-COA-R3-CV, 2011 WL 5145741, at *3 (Tenn. Ct. App., filed Oct. 28, 2011) (citing McMillin, 2009 WL 749214, at *3). The developers\u2019 appeal of the order of dismissal in the circuit court case does not constitute an appeal of the chancery court case. Without an appeal, the chancery court order became a final judgment thirty days after it was entered. Creech v. Addington, 281 S.W.3d 363, 377 (Tenn. 2009) (<HOLDING>). \u201cThe thirty-day time limit for filing a holding attorney may not wait more than thirty days from the entry of final judgment give notice of nonrepresentation and then seek to enforce a hen not noticed before the entry of the final judgmentholding that the requirement to serve a motion for attorney fees or costs within thirty days after filing of judgment applies even where the final judgment reserves jurisdiction to award sameholding that california supreme courts denial of habeas petition becomes final thirty days after filingholding in part as a general rule a trial courts judgment becomes final thirty days after its entry unless a party files a timely notice of appeal or specified posttrial motionholding that trial court has no power to allow party to amend motion for new trial more than thirty days after trial court signed the final judgment and that denial of amended motion for new trial filed more than thirty days after judgment preserved nothing for appellate review & \n\nby certain actions of the defendant. See HRPP Rule 48(c). In the instant case, the circuit court did not calculate excludable periods because, given a starting date of October 28, 1996, any periods excludable under subsection (c) would not have brought the total number of days between arrest and motion to dismiss (444 days) below the 180-day limit. However, since we have concluded that the dates of indictment start the Rule 48 clock running, we must calculate and deduct any excludable periods. Defendant\u2019s October 10, 1997 oral motion to continue, his counsel\u2019s August 18, 1997 motion to withdraw, and the periods of delay they created are per se excludable. HRPP Rule 48(d)(1); see also State v. Sujohn, 64 Haw. 516, 520, 644 P.2d 1326, 1328, reconsideration denied, 64 Haw. 688 (1982) (<HOLDING>). The eight days between the granting of holding that the essential inquiry in conversion of a rule 12b6 motion to a rule 56 motion is whether the appellant should reasonably have recognized the possibility that the motion might be converted into one for summary judgment or was taken by surprise and deprived of a reasonable opportunity to meet facts outside the pleadingsholding that a fivemonth delay in filing a motion to disqualify did not bar the motion where there was a reasonable explanation for the delayholding that the exclusion in rule 48c1 hrpp of periods of delay should be taken from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on or other prompt disposition of the motion citation omittedholding among other things that there should be excluded from computing the time for trial a period from the filing of a motion on september 18 until finai disposition of the motion by the trial court on its own motion on december 28 that is 102 daysholding that a motion to continue a hearing on a postjudgment motion was ineffective to extend the period for the trial court to rule on the motion absent the express consent of the parties & \n\nnot \u201cserious\u201d enough to require the protection of that a constitutional guaranty of jury trial does not apply to proceedings to punish for contempt of court whether in a court of law, a court of equity, a court having criminal jurisdiction, or other court.\u201d Pass v.

Additionally, unlike criminal prosecutions, general contempt proceedings do not require an indictment and subsequent' prosecution by the State. Tenn. R.Crim. P. 42(b)(2); Green v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 185-86, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958), overruled in part on other grounds by Bloom, 391 U.S. at 196 n. 1, 198, 88 S.Ct. 1477; State v. Wood, 91 S.W.3d 769, 773 (Tenn.Ct.App.2002) (<HOLDING>). Contempt proceedings are often initiated upon holding that the sixth amendment right to counsel attaches at the time of a formal charge which we construe to be an arrest warrant or at the time of the preliminary hearing in those rare cases where a preliminary hearing is not preceded by an arrest warrant or by indictment or presentment when the charge is initiated by the grand jury quoting state v mitchell 593 sw2d 280 286 tenn 1980recognizing that an indictment may be dismissed in partholding a statement in the motion for new trial entitled certificate of presentment in which appellate counsel stated the motion was handdelivered to the trial court insufficient to establish presentmentrecognizing that criminal contempt is not initiated by an indictment or presentmentholding that certificate of presentment and docket entry noting filing of motion were insufficient evidence of presentment & \n\nrights of action that have not been clearly legislated because of its regard for the state legislature as a \u201crepository of sovereign powers, whose dispensation must in any context be strictly construed.\u201d A & E Supply Co. v.

Although it was the defendant\/debtor that filed the notice of appeal, the appeal is considered to be the continuation of a proceeding \"against the debtor,\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1).

As the Supreme Court explained in Mathiason, 429 U.S. at 495, 97 S.Ct. 711: Any interview of one suspected of a crime by a police officer will have coercive aspects to it, simply by virtue of the fact that the police officer is part of a law enforcement system which may ultimately cause the suspect to be charged with a crime. But police officers are not required to administer Miranda warnings to everyone whom they question. Another established rule is that police do not violate Mira th Cir.1969) (<HOLDING>); State v. Patterson, 146 N.C.App. 113, 552 holding that appellants complaint on appeal that the environment was coercive did not change the fact that he was not in custody when he voluntarily went to the police station was told several times he could leave and did leave after the interrogationholding that accused was not in custody when told he was not under arrest and was free to leave and did in fact freely leave the interviewholding that a defendant who was told several times he was not under arrest and who never asked to leave during an interview with investigators was not in custodyholding that the defendant was placed in official detention when two police officers approached him and told him that he was under arrest as the defendant could not reasonably have believed that he was free to leaveholding in the context of a prosecution for second degree escape that although defendant was not handcuffed he had nonetheless been placed under arrest had had his liberty restrained in that he was not free to leave and at that point the first step in the process of transporting him to the police station had begun consequently the defendants arrest was complete and he was in custody & \n\nthe website looked like Heather. But in analyzing a judicial deception claim, we need not scrutinize police investigative tactics in this fashion. 10 . As discussed above, the materiality of an omission is an issue for the court. 11 . The Ewings quote Shirk's testimony from Prater and Memory's trial, but the officers obviously did not have this information at the time they prepared the warrant affidavit. The Ewings also fault the officers for not asking Shirk more questions, such as whether he had been drinking, how long he looked at the female, whether her helmet face shield was up or down, and what the lighting conditions were. But judicial deception claims do not require an inquiry into the quality of the police investigation. See generally Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-36, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (<HOLDING>). 12 . After the Ewings' arrest, Contreras did holding that allegations in a pro se complaint are to be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the complaint submitted by a pro se plaintiff must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the allegations in a pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersrecognizing that because affidavits are typically drafted in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation by nonlawyers they must be read with an understanding of that context and accordingly held to a lower standard of scrutiny than that applied to pleadings filed in more formal proceedingsholding that affidavits for search warrants must be interpreted in a commonsense and realistic fashion because they are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation & \n\nwitnesses was held to be violative of accepted grand jury practice, therefore requiring dismissal of the indictment. Similarly, in United States v. Bowdach, 324 F.Supp. 123 (S.D.Fla.1971), it was held that the presence of a witness who played audio tapes for the purpose of refreshing the memory of other witnesses constituted a violation of Rule 6(d). It has likewise been held that Rule 6(d) is violated where an attorney for the government testifies before the grand jury and then, having resumed his prosecutorial role, remains in the grand jury room in the presence of other witnesses. See United States v. Gold, 470 F.Supp. 1336, 1351 (N.D.Ill.1979); United States v. Treadway, 445 F.Supp. 959, 962 (N.D.Tex.1978); contra, however, is United States v.

Nobles and Hales\u2019s proposed amended complaint could relate back if it met the requirements of either Rule 15(c)(1) or Rule 15(c)(3). Saxton v. ACF Industries, Inc., 254 F.3d 959, 966 n. 11 (11th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Rule 15(c)(3) sets forth the federal rule for recognizing strictness of maryland rule in a diversity caseholding that a proposed amendment seeking to change a defendant in a diversity case could relate back under either rule 15c1 or 15c3holding that in order for a defendant to remove a case to federal court based upon diversity jurisdiction there must be complete diversity of citizenship both at the time that the case is commenced and at the time that the notice of removal is filedholding that state law provides the standard of review for a denial of a rule 50 motion in a diversity caseholding that statutory change in diversity requirements is not other paper & \n\ndate. Id. The Seventh Circuit reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal for a failure to state a conspiracy claim. The Walker court noted that Rule 9 was inapplicable, and held that \u201cit is enough in pleading a conspiracy to merely indicate the parties, general purpose, and approximate date, so that the defendant has notice of what he is charged with.\u201d Id. The Walker court also distinguished its holding from its earlier holding in Ryan v.

Although the phone number belonged to Awadallah at a former address, it is hard to see why that matters to the investigation. Whether Awadallah was in fact cooperating was surely as unknown to Agent Plunkett as it was to the district court and as it is to us. As to the \"box-cutter,\u201d the tool is multi-purpose, and Agent Plunkett expressed no view as to why Awadallah had one. 21 . We assume for purposes of this discussion, without deciding, that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment must be excluded from a material witness arrest warrant as well as from a search warrant. See United States v. Marchand, 564 F.2d 983 (2d Cir.1977) (<HOLDING>) (citation omitted). 22 . In arguing that a holding that where an arrest was premised on both legally and illegally obtained evidence the validity of the arrest would depend on whether the untainted information considered by itself establishes probable causeholding that the validity of the arrest does not depend on whether the suspect actually committed a crime the mere fact that the subject is later acquitted of the offense for which he is arrested is irrelevant to the validity of the arrestholding in the alternative that even if handcuffing a suspect did convert the detention into an arrest the arrest was justified by probable causeholding that arrest was unsupported by probable cause but granting qualified immunity to defendants who made the arrest in reliance on communications with other officersholding that hearsay evidence is considered valuable evidence in testing probable cause to arrest & \n\nOwens\u2019s lengthy criminal history or because Owens was wearing baggy clothes that could have easily concealed a weapon; and the officer did not testify that the stop of the vehicle occurred in a high crime area. In short, nothing of substance appears in the record to justify the frisk of Owens except for the inarguable fact that he was a passenger in a vehicle driven by someone who possessed a crack pipe. Although further questioning may have revealed that the officer did have, in fact, articulable and independent suspicions that Owens was armed or dangerous, those reasons were not explicitly brought forth during the brief suppression hearing. 21 .

Nolan-Cooper, 155 F.3d at 236. When considering an alleged breach of a plea agreement, we first identify the terms of the agreement. We then determine whether there has been a breach. If so, we fashion a remedy. Id. at 235. In Miller\u2019s case, the Government filed a written 5K1.1 motion, which requested a downward departure of \u201c \u20183 levels from the parties\u2019 stipulated offense level of 26,\u2019 to \u2018offense level 23.\u2019 \u201d Br. for Appellee 27 (quoting App. 360). Miller asserts that he reasonably understood this to be- a term of the plea agreement and, therefore, that the Government was bound to recommend offense level 23 at sentencing. Cf. United States v.

We will assume for the sake of argument that holding federal court is not bound by terms of plea agreement between defendant and state authoritiesholding that the government is no longer bound by its obligations under a plea agreement when a defendant commits a material breachholding that objecting to guidelines calculations as specifically reserved in the plea agreement is not a breach of the plea agreement even if the objection is overruled and thus government is not released from obligation under the agreement to move for acceptance of responsibilityholding that when a court accepts a fixed plea agreement it is bound by the agreements termsholding that the government was bound by an agreement it treated as binding although it preceded the formal plea agreement & \n\nappeal waiver. 14 F.Supp.2d 816, 819 (E.D.Va.1998). The court concluded that the defendant could still file a petition under \u00a7 2255 if his claim alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or challenged the voluntariness of the guilty plea. Id. In sum, a \u00a7 2255 waiver should not bar ineffective assistance of counsel claims or claims that a guilty plea was involuntary, just as direct appeal waivers do not bar those claims. General enforcement of \u00a7 2255 waivers, subject to the same exceptions as direct appeal waivers, aligns with precedent from other district courts in this Circuit that have indicated a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to file a \u00a7 2255 motion is as valid as a waiver of the right to a direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 113 F.Supp.2d 879, 898 (E.D.Va.1999) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Tayman, 885 F.Supp. 832, 834 holding that a failure to file an appeal is within the scope of the waiver because the failure does not undermine the validity of the plea or waiverholding the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding a defendants waiver of appellate rights in a plea agreementholding that the united states breach of the plea agreement releases the defendant from the appeal waiverholding that a plea agreement with a waiver of direct appeal rights does not include a waiver of collateral remedies because the government could have included a waiver of collateral rights in the plea agreement and chose not to do soholding that a waiver of right to appeal contained in a plea agreement is enforceable & \n\n\u00a7 3553(a)(7) to justify the magistrate\u2019s decision to depart.

Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S. 321, 330, 91 S.Ct. 795, 802, 28 L.Ed.2d 77 (1971); Shipner v. Eastern Air Lines, Inc., 868 F.2d 401, 407 (11th Cir.1989). After a responsive pleading has been filed, subsequent amendments are permissible only with leave of court, which \u201cshall be freely given when justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). This liberal policy of allowing amendments under Rule 15(a) \u201ccircumscribes the exercise of the district court\u2019s discretion; thus, unless a substantial reason exists to deny leave to amend, the discretion of the district court is not broad enough to permit denial.\u201d Shipner, 868 F.2d at 407; see also Moore v.

We therefore hold that Freeman did not waive holding that equitable restitution is available but that legal restitution is notholding that where the government has not presented evidence at the hearing concerning the appropriate amount of restitution the imposition of the restitution order constitutes plain errorholding no restitution hearing is mandated when defendant did not object to order of restitution or request a hearingholding that as a matter of contract interpretation a plea agreement permitting a court to impose a restitution order beyond that authorized by statute might well be unenforceable on grounds of public policy and that the defendant is entitled to presume when she entered the plea agreement that the judge would order restitution in a legal mannerholding that a district court may order restitution despite a settlement agreement & \n\nto counsel. Of course, it could be said that Clark can hardly complain about the district court\u2019s grant of his own motion. But, because the court\u2019s discretion to deny a request for self-representation requires the court to consider the defendant\u2019s interest, I would conclude that a defendant who makes such a motion, against the advice of or without the support of his appointed counsel ke a searching inquiry of Clark\u2019s reasons for wanting to dismiss his present counsel. , On their face, Clark\u2019s claims that counsel had not visited him in jail, had not discussed the case with him, would not seek out suggested witnesses, and would not have the gun checked for fingerprints, raised serious questions that required inquiry. See, e.g., United States v. Morrissey, 461 F.2d 666, 669 (2d Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The majority suggests that Clark\u2019s claims do holding that the trial court abused its discretion in denying a motion to substitute counsel on the strength of gonzalezs sworn responses at the pleataking that no one was threatening him or forcing him to plead where the defendant alleged that his attorney forced him to plead guilty and threatened him if he did not take the pleaholding even when a request for an attorney is ambiguous it is incumbent upon law enforcement to seek clarification of the ambiguity before denying the statutory right to counselholding that in determining whether there exists a valid waiver of the right to counsel in the criminal setting the court may consider a defendants lack of good faith in working with appointed counsel including an unreasonable refusal to cooperate with counsel or an unreasonable request for substitution of appointed counsel and the timeliness of defendants request for new counsel particularly when a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuanceholding that an ambiguous mention of an attorney is not a request for counselholding that a defendants claim that his attorney did not meet with him or seek out witnesses required a searching inquiry before denying the request for new counsel & \n\nthat the 2013 arbitration provision is \u201cpermeated with unconscionability,\u201d taken together such a conclusion is required. As the California Supreme Court has held, multiple substantively unconscionable terms in or related to an arbitration agreement \u201cindicate a systemic effort to impose arbitration on an employee not simply as an alternative to litigation, but as an inferior forum that works to the employer\u2019s advantage.\u201d Armendariz, 24 Cal.4th at 124, 99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745. At bottom, a trial court does not \u201cabuse its discretion in concluding that [an] arbitration agreement is permeated by an unlawful purpose\u201d where the arbitration agreement contains \u201cmultiple unlawful provisions.\u201d Id.; see also Bridge Fund Capital Corp. v. Fastbucks Franchise Corp., 622 F.3d 996, 1005-06 (9th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>).

Nondisclosure of mere impeachment evidence is insufficient to invalidate an otherwise voluntary plea. Although \u201c[t]he principles of Brady are applicable to the entry of a plea of guilty,\u201d Scroggins, 859 S.W.2d at 707, they are applicable only to the extent that the nondisclosed evidence is both exculpatory and material; a post-guilty-plea claim involving the nondisclosure of mere impeachment evidence (even if it might have been material in the context of a trial) is insufficient to invalidate an otherwise voluntary plea. U.S. v. Ruiz, 536 U.S. 622, 628-33, 122 S.Ct. 2450, 153 L.Ed.2d 586 (2002) (<HOLDING>).

A hypothetical illustrates the efficacy of a unitary standard of review. If a district court were to depart upward based upon physical injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2, p.s., we might conclude that it had abused its discretion if the underlying offense were obstruction of justice, because the guideline applicable to that offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(1), provides for an eight-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved caus[es] ... physical injury to a person.\u201d Our review in such a situation would amount to a de novo review of the applicable guideline to determine whether, as a matter of law, it takes physical injury into account. See United States v. Rybicki, 96 F.3d 754, 758 (4th Cir.1996) (noting that when the determinat (4th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 956, 136 holding that downward departure based on defendants restitution was improper because restitution is taken into consideration in assessing whether acceptance of responsibility adjustment should apply and district court abused its discretion in finding defendants restitution was extraordinaryholding apprendi inapplicable to restitution orders because restitution for harm done is a classic civil remedyholding that district court may not depart downward to preserve defendants ability to make restitutionholding no restitution hearing is mandated when defendant did not object to order of restitution or request a hearingholding that equitable restitution is available but that legal restitution is not & \n\nto 161 months of imprisonment. Nicholson timely appeals. Counsel has raised two issues: (1) whether Nicholson\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary and (2) whether his sentence was unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we affirm. The Government first asks us to dismiss the appeal, based on Nicholson\u2019s waiver of his appellate rights in his plea agreement. We decline to enforce the waiver, however, as this provision of the plea agreement was not reviewed at Nicholson\u2019s plea hearing. See United States v. Wessells, 936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir. 1991). Nonetheless, we find that Nicholson\u2019s claims fail on the merits.

Modern Acceptance (1970s-Today) Today, approximately ninety-four percent of all state convictions and ninety-seven percent of all federal convictions are resolved by plea bargaining. See Missouri v. Frye, \u2014 U.S, -, 132 S.Ct. 1399, 1407, 182 L.Ed.2d 379 (2012) (<HOLDING>).

A special condition of the probation was jail time equal to the amount of time he had already served in this case. This meant, in effect, that his sentence was complete upon the court\u2019s acceptance of the plea and entry of the judgment and sentence. Because Petitioner had already completed the incarceration which was a special condition of his probation, the trial court \u201cterminated\u201d Petitioner\u2019s probation following acceptance of the plea. The court then discharged the $5000 bond Petitioner had previously posted. The court\u2019s plea offer was made over the objection of the State. The sentence departed below the sentencing guidelines, and the trial court did not provide written reasons for the departure. See Fla.R.Crim. P. 3.701(d)(11) and Pope v. State, 561 So.2d 554 (Fla.1990) (<HOLDING>).

Because this issue is not yet ripe for review, we dismiss. See United States v. Streich, 560 F.3d 926, 931-32 (9th Cir.2009); Cf. United States v. Antelope, 395 F.3d 1128, 1132-33 (9th Cir.2005).

Tadefa\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is holding that appellate court will not normally address issue raised for the first time on appealholding that an issue not presented to the trial court will not be considered on appealrecognizing that this court construes rule 10e narrowly and has held that normally the reviewing court will not supplement the record on appeal with material not considered by the trial courtholding that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this courtholding that a claim not raised before the trial court will not be considered for the first time on appeal & \n\nbankruptcy court record, including the consolidated pre-trial order, the McFarlands\u2019 proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and their post-trial, brief, shows that the McFarlands did not present the constructive trust arguments they raise on appeal to the bankruptcy court for resolution. (See Bankr. Dkt. Entries 43, 53, & 76). Nor did they make these arguments in their brief on appeal to. the district court. (See Dist. Dkt. Entry 6). Rather, they asserted throughout the underlying proceedings only that a resulting trust was established. Therefore, the McFarlands cannot now complain that the bankruptcy court failed to address whether a constructive trust was established, and we decline to consider these arguments for the first time on appeal.

In any case, the McFarlands\u2019 arguments do not holding that an argument not raised before the bankruptcy court will not be considered for the first time on appealholding that court will not consider issue raised for first time on appealholding that an issue raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered by this courtholding that an argument raised for the first time in response to defendants motion to dismiss instead of in an amended complaint was not properly raised before the district court and would not be considered on appealholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered & \n\nTherefore, it was an allegation based on speculation and conjecture. The trial court conducted a hearing, at which Walker could have pursued this legal theory, objected to the State\u2019s alleged lack of evidence of probable cause to arrest, presented evidence to support his allegation, and argued that the lack of evidence required that his statement be suppressed. Walker, however, remained silent; he did not pursue this issue in the trial court; and he did not allow the trial court the opportunity to prevent the alleged injustice. See Adams v. State, 585 So.2d 161, 164 (Ala.l991)(\u201cMatters not objected to at trial cannot be considered for the first time on appeal, since review on appeal applies only to rulings by the trial court.\u201d)- Cf. Coulliette v. State, 857 So.2d 793, 795 (Ala.2003)(<HOLDING>). Walker\u2019s silence and abandonment of this holding that an appellate court considers the entire record on appeal not just the evidence presented at the suppression hearing in affirming the denial of a motion to suppressholding that issues not raised before the trial court cannot be raised on appealholding issues not raised in appellate brief are waivedholding that issues not raised in the trial court may not be raised later on appealholding that because a specific argument raised on appeal was not presented at suppression hearing the motion to suppress did not give the trial court notice of the specific issues the defendant raised in his appellate brief therefore the trial court did not have the opportunity to rectify these alleged errors the defendants motion was not sufficient to preserve the issues presented by him in his brief quoting aeree v state 673 so2d 855 856 alacrimapp1995 & \n\nmarijuana patch, (2) the defendant t Ryan, who has substantial expertise and training in investigations relating to marijuana cultivation, that marijuana and other indicia of marijuana cultivation would be located at defendant\u2019s residence.

In short,- contrary to defendant\u2019s claim, the totality of these facts do provide a reasonable, common-sense basis for believing that marijuana and related contraband would be found in his residence.

See Utah R.App.P. 11(e)(2). \u201cTherefore, our review is strictly limited to whether the trial court\u2019s findings of fact support its conclusions of law and judgment.\u201d Sampson, 770 P.2d at 1002; accord State v. Garza, 820 P.2d 937, 938-39 (Utah App.1991) (<HOLDING>). Section 76-2-303 of the Utah Code sets forth holding that as a general rule this court will not consider an issue that was not raised belowrecognizing general rule that an appellate court cannot address claims that were not raised belowholding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review a legal claim not presented in administrative proceedings belowholding that argument offered in defense of decision below had been waived when not raised belowholding court cannot consider proceedings below without adequate record & \n\nsame counsel during his trial proceedings and on his direct appeals. Moreover, he had the benefit of two attorneys\u2019 thoughts concerning the post-conviction petitions. We note parenthetically that the attorney who initially drafted one of the petitions, and reviewed the record in Stewart II, did not choose to raise any claim regarding Mr. Pumilia\u2019s alleged incompetency. More significantly, defendant did not even raise this issue in his briefs filed with this court appealing the denial of his post-conviction petitions. Our Supreme Court Rule 341(e)(7) provides that points not asserted in an appellant\u2019s brief are waived and shall not be raised for the first time, as defendant did here, during oral argument. 107 Ill. 2d R. 341(e)(7); see also People v. Lewis (1984), 105 Ill. 2d 226, 249-50 (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, defendant claims that Mr. holding argument is waived when raised for first time in reply briefholding that defendant waived review of an issue which he raised for the first time during oral argumentholding that an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief is waivedholding that an argument raised for the first time in a rule 59e motion is waived on appealholding that argument raised at oral argument that was not included in brief is waived & \n\nmoves into the realm of res judicata.\u201d). The doctrine of issue preclusion \u201ccomes into play when an issue involved in a prior decision is the same issue involved in a subsequent action.\u201d See Mabry v. State Bd. of Community Colleges & Occupational Educ., 813 F.2d 311, 316 (10th Cir.1987). If the bankruptcy court\u2019s turnover order, which the debtors did not appeal, \u201cactually and necessarily decided\u201d the exemption issue, principles of issue preclusion could prevent the debtors from raising this argument in an appeal from a subsequent order. See id. (noting that issue preclusion does not apply unless \u201cthe issue is actually decided in the first action\u201d and \u201cit was necessary to decide the issue in disposing of the first action\u201d); see also In re Albrecht, 233 F.3d 1258, 1260-61 (10th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Turshen v. Chapman, 823 F.2d 836, 839 (4th holding that court lacked jurisdiction on appeal from injunction because the order was simply an interpretation of an earlier orderholding that under the doctrine of direct estoppel a law firms failure to appeal the bankruptcy courts earlier order barred it from challenging the courts holding on its appeal from a subsequent orderholding that an issue not raised on direct appeal of sentence is barred by the law of the case from presentation in a subsequent appealholding that notice indicating appeal was from judgment on date of jury verdict was insufficient to preserve appeal from earlier order granting summary judgmentholding that under the law of the case doctrine an issue of fact or law decided on appeal may not be reexamined by the appellate court on a subsequent appeal & \n\nwould have a realistic opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice, albeit by a small margin. Furthermore, it is appropriate for a district court to consider the substantial increase in turnout of black voters that usually follows the creation of an opportunity district in its effectiveness analysis. See United States v. Euclid City Sch. Bd., 632 F.Supp.2d 740, 765 (N.D. Ohio 2009) (\"[I]t is unreasonable to assume that minority turnout will not increase under a system in which that turnout is made meaningful, relative to a system in which that turnout was entirely ineffective.\u201d) With the boost in turnout of black voters the district becomes substantially more effective. 188 .

(citation omitted). We held that the district court was required to independently determine whether the requirements of the metropolitan court were complied with and thus remanded the case to district court to make such a determination. Id. Compare State v. Spillman, 2010-NMCA-019, \u00b6 6, 147 N.M. 676, 227 P.3d 1058 (filed 2009) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 2010-NMCERT-001, 147 N.M. 673, holding that where a defendant fails to challenge his plea in district court he must establish plain errorholding that before a defendant could contest the validity of a plea entered in metropolitan court by appealing to district court he had to first move to set aside his plea in metropolitan court because in an ontherecord appeal to district court that court is the equivalent of an appellate courtholding that the district court had jurisdiction to order restitution of award overturned on appeal even in the absence of a remand from the appellate courtholding that because a claim was never raised in the district court this court would not consider it for the first time on appealholding that if the defendant fails to file a motion in the trial court to withdraw his plea he cannot attack it for the first time on appeal & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nService; that Zou insufficiently explained material omissions in his earliest affidavit; and that Zou\u2019s version of events was not consistent with the documentary evidence he submitted. We agree that there is substantial evidence in the record for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination against Zou and for the IJ\u2019s decision to deny Zou asylum. We have carefully considered all of Zou\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Those arguments and supporting materials raised for the first time in this court without being properly presented to the IJ or the BIA cannot be considered; our jurisdiction is limited to the evidence in the record. See 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4)(1994); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A)(2000); INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (<HOLDING>). For the reasons set forth above, the decision holding that the decision of the bia will not be affirmed by this court unless the reasons for such a finding are made clearholding that the court of appeals committed clear error and seriously disregarded the agencys legally mandated role when it based its decision on information that had not been presented to the biaholding that the court need not follow a decision of the district of columbia court of appeals where it appears that the court of appeals itself would not follow that decisionholding that we will not review an issue or claim that was not presented to the bia in the petitioners notice of appeal or brief to the bia even if the bia considered the issue or claim sua sponteholding that under the arbitrary and capricious standard this court must consider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment & \n\nEven if an updated psychological evaluation had been conducted at the time of the original posteonviction hearing, the results would in all probability be invalid at the time of a second hearing well over one year later. Consequently, such evidence could not have been discovered at the time of the original 1981 hearing and should have been allowed one year later at the 1982 hearing.

In order to determine the reasonableness of the search and the instances requiring less than probable cause, the Supreme Court set out the following test: The test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application. In each case it requires a balancing of the need for the particular search against the invasion of personal rights that the search entails. Courts must consider the scope L.Ed.2d 479 (1985); Tinetti v. Wittke, 620 F.2d 160 (7th Cir.1980), aff'g, 479 F.Supp. 486 (E.D.Wis.1979) (<HOLDING>).

Jones to be inapposite. See State v. Jones, _ N.C. App. _, _, 750 S.E.2d 883, 886 (2013) (citing State v. Martin, _ N.C. App. _, 735 S.E.2d 238 (2012) (<HOLDING>)). We also note that in United States v. Jones, holding that the fourth amendment proscription against unreasonable searches and seizures was applicable to the states under the fourteenth amendment so that evidence seized in violation of the constitution could no longer be used in state courtsholding that the fourth amendment right implicated in a malicious prosecution action is the right to be free of unreasonable seizure of the personholding sbm is not a violation of the defendants fourth amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizuresholding parolees right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures was unaffected by his signing of the consent to search provisionholding that forfeiture statute is subject to the fourth amendments prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures & \n\napartment # 3 constituted an illegal search for Fourth Amendment purposes, and the fruit of that search, which was the information that Jackson\u2019s key fit the lock, was used to obtain the search warrant for apartment # 3. Thus, Taylor argues that the corrected search warrant for apartment # 3 was tainted and invalid because it was fruit of the poisonous tree. The Eighth Circuit has not decided whether trying a key in a lock constitutes a search for purposes of the Fourth Amendment. See United States v. Dickson, 58 F.3d 1258, 1264 (8th Cir.), superseded on other grounds, 64 F.3d 409 (8th Cir.1995), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 747, 133 L.Ed.2d 695 (1996). The federal courts of appeals are split on this issue. See, e.g., United States v. Concepcion, 942 F.2d 1170, 1172 (7th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Lyons, 898 F.2d 210, 212-13 holding that in a 1983 action issue of probable cause is for the juryholding that although the owner of a lock has enough privacy interest in a keyhole to make the inspection of that lock a search the privacyinterest is so small that no probable cause is needed to inspect itholding that a defendant has no constitutional right to challenge the search or seizure of property belonging to a third party even if the search was without probable causeholding that the subjective intent of the officer is no longer determinative wjhen applying the objective test generally the only determination to be made is whether probable cause existed for the stop in question and that per whren a violation of traffic law provided sufficient probable cause to make the subsequent search and seizure reasonablerecognizing that a greater expectation of privacy exists in property that is carried on ones person so that probable cause is required & \n\ngovernmental conduct, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of \u2018substantive due process,\u2019 must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\u201d Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s holing in Graham, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected alleged deprivations of substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment based either on excessive force or on malicious prosecution. Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright, 548 F.3d 155 (1st Cir.2008) (dismissing a substantive due process claim for deprivation of a life interest because the claim was based on excessive force more appropriately brought under the Fourth Amendment); Torres-Rivera v. O\u2019Neill-Cancel, 406 F.3d 43, 51-53 (1st Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); Roche v. John Hancock Mutual Life Ins., 81 holding that whether an officers force was reasonable must be analyzed under the reasonableness standard of the fourth amendmentholding that the protect act amendments to the standard of review apply retroactivelyholding that an excessive force claim is governed by the fourth amendments objectively reasonable standard rather than the fourteenth amendments shock the conscience standardholding that claims that law enforcement officials used excessive force in making an arrest are properly analyzed under the fourth amendments objective reasonableness standardholding that new york law reasonable cause standard is equivalent to fourth amendments probable cause standard & \n\nfor determining whether a war-rantless search of a probationer is reasonable is whether the police or probation officer has a well-founded suspicion that a probation violation has occurred. The determination of whether a probationer\u2019s right to privacy has been violated is dependent, then, on the nature of the search conducted and is not dependent on the nature of the proceeding in which the fruits of the search are to be admitted. Id. at 1095 (emphasis original, internal footnotes and citations omitted). Appellant also cites Mason v. State, 838 S.W.2d 657, 659 (Tex. Ct. App. 1992) (recognizing that \u201c[ejvidence that is obtained as a result of an illegal search and seizure is inadmissible over objection in a probation revocation hearing\u201d), and State v. Dodd, 419 So.2d 333 (Fla. 1982) (<HOLDING>). The Commonwealth, in its brief, cites a holding that probation revocation proceedings are clearly not criminal proceedingsholding that the exclusionary rule embodied in the search and seizure provision of the state constitution applies in probation revocation proceedingsholding that probation and parole revocation hearings are not criminal proceedings such that the state exclusionary rule applies but noting that police misconduct which shocks the conscience may lead to invocation of the exclusionary ruleholding that exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture proceedingsholding that the exclusionary rule under the fourth amendment applies to civil forfeiture proceedings & \n\nfor an exclusionary rule analysis, we will remand. A government search of a private home presumptively violates the Fourth Amendment absent exigent circumstances or a valid warrant. See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980). To be valid, the relevant portion of the Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant \u201cparticularly describe] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV (emphases added). The particularity requirement \u2014 \u201cthe touchstone of [the] warrant,\u201d Doe v. Groody, 361 F.3d 232, 239 (3d Cir.2004) \u2014 is satisfied by expressly listing items to be seized or expressly incorporating by reference an affidavit that lists such items. See Bartholomew v. Pennsylvania, 221 F.3d 425, 428-429 (3d Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). The requirement that the warrant particularly holding that pursuant to the best evidence rule trial testimony relying on documents was inadmissible without submission of such documents or an explanation as to why the documents were unavailableholding that plan documents could be incorporated without converting the motion to one for summary judgment even though the complaint referred only to the plan and not the accompanying documentsholding that 1 the complaint is deemed to include any documents incorporated in it by reference and any document upon which it solely relies and which is integral to the complaint and that the court may consider such documents on a motion to dismiss pursuant to fedrcivp 12b6holding that if a warrants particularity depends upon incorporated documents those documents must physically accompany the warrantholding that where original documents were illegally seized those documents as well as all copies had to be returned & \n\n21.) The conversation captured by Riddle\u2019s digital recorder belies this assertion and makes clear the extent of his intrusion, which included ordering Modrell to remain in one place and threatening to handcuff him. Riddle has not identified, and this Court cannot discern, any law-enforcement interest that justified encroaching on Modrell\u2019s privacy and freedom of movement in this way. d. Duration of Seizure The fourth McArthur factor considers whether the length of the seizure was reasonably related to the law-enforcement interest at stake. Scmgineto-Miranda accounts for this factor as part of its totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, see supra note 7. A two\u2014 to three-hour delay to procure a search warrant is not per se unreasonable. Compare McArthur, 531 U.S. at 332, 121 S.Ct. 946 (<HOLDING>), with United States v. Song Ja Cha, 597 F.3d holding that an initially reasonable seizure can become an unreasonable seizure that violates the fourth amendment when officers refuse to return seized propertyholding that excessive force claims are not subject to exhaustion requirementholding that there was no fourth amendment seizure where delivery of package was not delayed because it is the extent of the interference with the defendants possessory interest in the property that determines whether a seizure has occurredholding that a twohour residential seizure was not excessiveholding the eighth amendment succinctly prohibits excessive sanctions it provides excessive bail shall not be required nor excessive fines imposed nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted & \n\nin violation of Fourth Amendment). We have not adopted the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception for purposes of art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights or statutory violations, focusing instead on whether the violations are substantial and prejudicial. See Commonwealth v. Beldotti, 409 Mass. 553, 559 (1991) (denying exclusion of evidence because intrusion was minimal, but noting \u201cwe do not rely on any theory the police were proceeding in good faith reliance [on] a defective search warrant\u201d); Commonwealth v. Pellegrini, 405 Mass. 86, 91 n.6 (1989) (reiterating that Massachusetts law has not adopted good faith exception of United States v. Leon, supra, to exclusionary rule); Commonwealth v. Treadwell, 402 Mass. 355, 356 n.3 (1988) (same); Commonwealth v. Sheppard, 394 Mass. 381, 391 (1985) (<HOLDING>). See also J.A. Grasso & C.M. McEvoy, holding that an arrest warrant without a search warrant does not permit law enforcement authorities to enter a third partys home to legally search for the subject of the arrest warrantholding that deficiency as to particularity in warrant not prejudicial under art 14 where search was conducted as if warrant were in compliance and thus was not unreasonableholding it was reasonably practicable to obtain warrant to search defendants vehicle where courts were open on day of warrantless search and judges were available to sign warrantholding warrant valid where search warrant application affidavit was signed and probable cause existed for issuance of warrantholding that strip search incident to arrest was not per se unreasonable but holding that search was performed in an unreasonable manner when conducted in view of the public & \n\nsituation.\u201d Id. at 396-97. Nevertheless, the applicable standard is an objective one: \u201c[T]he question is whether the officers\u2019 actions are objectively reasonable in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d Id. at 397. In the present case, Wilkey was not committing any crime when Argo confronted him. Nor was Wilkey resisting arrest or even seeking to avoid an encounter with law enforcement officers. Instead, he consented to a pat down search prior to Argo\u2019s use of force against him. This search revealed that Wilke degree of force is necessary, gratuitous acts against a person who has been seized might violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. Phelps v. Coy, 286 F.3d 295, 297, 301-02 (6th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Santos, 287 F.3d at 853 (explaining that holding that suspect was not in custody when officer handcuffed him for officer safety while transporting him to police stationholding that defendant was arrested when the police officer took physical custody of him by grabbing his arm and returned him to the hotel for detention thererecognizing the necessity of analyzing officer coys use of force against phelps in segments where coy arrested phelps placed him in handcuffs took him to the police station for booking and then beat him after he raised his leg in a manner that coy perceived to be a threat to another police officerholding the defendant was not under arrest when police asked him to go to the station and then offered him a ride because he did not have transportationholding that police executed an illegal arrest when they took a teenage suspect from his home and brought him in handcuffs to the police station for questioning & \n\nat the time they sought the warrants.

In the present case, only 1.89 grams of marijuana was found on defendant\u2019s person, which alone is insufficient to prove that defendant had the intent to sell or deliver. See State v.

However, the majority\u2019s harmless-error analysis does not alter my view that the resolution of the harmlessness question is at least debatable and far from certain or readily apparent. As the majority candidly acknowledges, the cases on which it relies only hold that constructive possession may be inferred from a defendant\u2019s exclusive control of the premises in which the firearms are found; the cases do not indicate that a defendant\u2019s exclusive control of the premises necessitates an inference of constructive possession. See United States v. Hishaw, 235 F.3d 565, 571 (10th Cir. 2000) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Griffin, 684 F.3d holding that the defendants dominion control and knowledge may be inferred if he had exclusive possession of the premises on which the object was found emphasis addedholding that if the site where the contraband is found is in joint rather than exclusive possession a defendants knowledge of the contrabands presence and his ability to control it cannot be inferred merely from the defendants proximity to the contrabandholding that circumstance that contraband was found in a box bearing defendants name was sufficient to support an inference of knowledge and dominion and controlholding that where drugs are found in the presence and plain view of the owner or resident occupant of a home dominion and control maybe inferredholding when drugs are found on premises exclusive control provides significant proof of constructive possession & \n\npresence of criminal activity at Pruett\u2019s residence, but we nonetheless conclude that the executing officers did not act entirely without reason in relying on the magistrate\u2019s determination that evidence of &\u25a0 crime would be found in the residence. Although our Circuit has not adopted a per se rule that evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug trafficking establishes an inference that further evidence of drug trafficking will be found in the defendant\u2019s residence, we have held that in applying the Leon exception, such evidence of a defendant\u2019s drug trafficking indicated that officers acted reasonably in relying on a search warrant issued for the defendant\u2019s residence. See United States v. Ross, 487 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2007); see also United States v. Marion, 238 F.3d 965, 969 (8th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). In addition, Pruett attacks the warrant holding that the warrant application at issue did not specifically mention the presence of criminal activity at defendants residence but that the executing officers reasonably relied on warrantholding that executing officers reasonably relied on judges determination that there was probable cause to search motel room for evidence of drug activity even though search warrant affidavit failed to mention a connection between motel room and criminal activityholding that a defendants prior conviction for possession of a controlled substance and felon in possession of a firearm helped support probable cause to search his motel room for evidence of burglaryholding warrantless search of motel room after occupant was arrested outside room for drug possession could not be justified as search incident to arrest absent other exigent circumstancesholding that the warrant application at issue did not specifically mention the presence of criminal activity at defendants residence but that the executing officers reasonably relied on the warrant & \n\nthat would arise if we were to affirm a removal order on a ground introduced only on appeal and not raised or litigated below, see Alvarez-Santos v. INS, 332 F.3d 1245, 1252 (9th Cir.2003), the government\u2019s argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of our review. Whatever the grounds on which Al Mutarreb might have been found removable, only one was charged. We have no power to affirm the BIA on a ground never charged by the Service or found by the IJ. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (noting that a \u201ccourt is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate and proper basis\u201d not relied on by the agency); see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Nor do we accept the government\u2019s contention holding that when an ij issues a decision granting an aliens application for withholding of removal without a grant of asylum the decision must include an explicit order of removal designating a country of removalholding proof of possession of stolen goods is sufficient evidence to sustain conviction for theftholding that term order of removal does not include aliens ineffective assistance of counsel claim concerning attorneys actions taken after order of removal becomes finalholding that the defendants prior drug conviction for simple possession did not constitute a controlled substance offense because the plain language of 4b12b requires that the prior conviction involve possession with intent to distributeholding that an aliens prior possession conviction cannot sustain the removal order because it was not alleged in the nta & \n\nof the district court\u2019s legal conclusions is de novo and thus less deferential. See id at 1216. But we give \u201cdue deference\u201d to the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts of each case. Id. at 1216-17.

To justify an offense level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), the district court had to find that Defendant possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with another felony offense.\u201d The additional felony offense identified by the district court, in this case, was kidnapping. See Cummings v. State, 968 P.2d 821, 832 (Okla.Crim.App.1998) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v.

Mincoff, 574 F.3d 1186, 1194 (9th Cir.2009) (citation and internal quotation omitted). The sale of the drugs on credit distinguishes this case from United States v. Lennick, 18 F.3d 814 (9th Cir.1994) as the arrangement provides evidence of an agreement and intent to redistribute the drugs beyond the actual sale. See Mincoff, 574 F.3d at 1193 (noting that \u201cevidence of fronting may support a conviction for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance\u201d). There was also testimony that Smith gave oxycodone pills to the government\u2019s confidential source in exchange for bringing Smith customers. Evidence of this \u201cdrug commission\u201d was also sufficient to support a conviction for conspiracy to distribute oxycodone. See United States v. Webster, 623 F.3d 901, 907 (9th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>). We hold that there was sufficient evidence holding that evidence tending to show knowing participation in the conspiracy is sufficient to sustain conspiracy convictionholding that the evidence did not plausibly support a buyerseller instruction because overwhelming evidence showed that defendants agreed to import drugs with the intent to distribute them and engaged in repeated transactions of large quantities of narcotic drugs for resaleholding in part that awareness of resale activities together with evidence of kickback relationship is sufficient to support conviction for conspiracy to distributeholding no unfair prejudice from admission of conviction for possession of 50 to 200 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute as evidence of intent to distribute cocaineholding that circumstantial evidence alone is sufficient to support a cocaine conspiracy conviction & \n\nof a firearm during and in relation to the drug conspiracy and a carjacking incident) and Count 10 (knowingly possessing a firearm in furtherance of the drug conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute). The pre-sentence report stated that the mandatory minimum terms for these convictions were ten and five years, respectively. The Government objected, arguing that Count 10 constituted a second conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and therefore the mandatory minimum for Count 10 should be 25 years. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) (\u201cIn the case of a second or subsequent conviction under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924], the person shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.... \u201d); Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 131-33, 113 S.Ct. 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993) (<HOLDING>). The probation officer agreed with these holding that 924cs enhanced penalty for a second or subsequent conviction applies when the defendant is convicted of multiple 924c counts in a single proceedingholding that post conviction hearing act is not available to juvenile proceeding since the child is not convicted of a crimeholding that issues underlying all counts were sufficiently intertwined that the separate appeal of the summary judgment counts would complicate the trial of the remaining countsholding that where a statute provides for an enhanced penalty based on a defendants prior conviction the fact of conviction is a sentencing factor to be determined by the court rather than a juryholding that severance was not required when a defendant was charged with five counts of forcible rape two counts of felonious restraint three counts of kidnapping two counts of armed criminal action two counts of forcible sodomy one count of second degree assault one count of first degree robbery and one count of stealing & \n\ntell the jury to disregard the accomplice\u2019s testimony, See 10 Minnesota Practice, CRIMJIG 3.18, it does require that corroborating evidence \u201caffirm the truth of the accomplice\u2019s testimony and point to the guilt of the defendant in some substantial degree.\u201d Sorg, 275 Minn. at 5, 144 N.W.2d at 786.

Chapman agreed to cooperate with officers and do a controlled buy in order to avoid criminal charges and jail. Therefore, it is relevant that Chapman was afforded leniency in exchange for his cooperation because he could have been charged with possession or second-degree manslaughter. See Rodriguez, 2007 WL 1412880, at *2 (<HOLDING>). Second, the prosecutor relied heavily on holding that seconddegree manslaughter was not a crime of violence and thus was not an aggravated felony warranting an aliens removalholding on rehearing that the interests of justice would be better served by remanding for new trial on the offenses of seconddegree murder and voluntary manslaughterholding that the lower court properly charged the jury on voluntary manslaughter where defendant testified he was in fear of the threat of physical assaultholding that erroneous manslaughter instruction that defendant intentionally caused the death of the victim did not constitute fundamental error certifying question if a jury returns a verdict finding a defendant guilty of seconddegree murder in a case where the evidence does not support a theory of culpable negligence does a trial court commit fundamental error by giving a flawed manslaughter by act instruction when it also gives an instruction on manslaughter by culpable negligenceholding that drug user was properly charged with seconddegree manslaughter after he cooked a lethal dose of heroin for the victim & \n\nThe photograph of Smith\u2019s car is also relevant, as it provides context for the photos of the drugs found inside. The probative value of this evidence in proving Smith\u2019s knowledge and lack of mistake or accident in the possession of the contraband seized from his house was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. In addition, the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury properly limited the scope of their consideration of the evidence. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting it. Likewise, the district court committed no plain error in admitting the actual bags of methamphetamine. IV Finally, Smith argued that the district court erred in imposing a 60-month mandatory minimum sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), to run d 348 (2010) holding that the statute is mandatoryholding that dismissed drug counts are not more serious if their effect on the total sentence is less than the 924c fiveyear mandatory consecutive sentenceholding that a sentence was based on a mandatory statutory minimum sentence even though it was lowered under another statuteholding that a defendant is subject to a mandatory consecutive sentence for a 924c conviction and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of convictionholding a mandatory sentence is still subject to constitutional scrutiny & \n\ncontact with a controlled substance, chemical substance, or drug paraphernalia following John Doe\u2019s birth.\u201d II [\u00b6 10] The State argues the trial court should not have entertained Stegall\u2019s motion to dismiss.

The result is the same regardless whether our review is de novo or for plain error. According to the Court, Any fact that, by law, increases the penalty for a crime is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt. Mandatory minimum sentences increase the penalty for a crime. It follows, then, that any fact that increases the mandatory minimum is an \u2018element\u2019 that must be submitted to the jury. Alleyne v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 2155, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013) (internal citations omitted) (<HOLDING>). However, Joseph and Dunbar do not challenge holding that to apply the firearm enhancement the firearm need only reflect the context of the defendants possession and the defendants ability to use the firearm to promote the controlled substance offenseholding that use certainly includes brandishing a firearm quotation marks omittedholding defendants minimum sentence could not be increased for brandishing a firearm where based on jury instructions jury convicted defendant of the lesser offense of carrying rather than brandishing the firearmholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that the trial court was not entitled to impose a threeyear mandatory minimum sentence on a defendant convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon where the jury verdict did not specifically find actual possession & \n\nof the victim\u2019s conduct. See \u00a7 90.405, Fla. Stat. (2009). There are, however, important distinctions and evi-dentiary requirements between reputation evidence and evidence of specific acts admitted under section 90.404(l)(b). Grace v. State, 832 So.2d 224, 226 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002); Pino, 389 So.2d at 1194. The purpose of introducing the reputation evidence in a self-defense case is to show that the victim was the initial aggressor. Pino, 389 So.2d at 1194. Reputation evidence is offered to show that the victim acted in conformity with a known character trait. Because reputation evidence relates to the conduct of the victim, the defendant is not required to have had prior knowledge of the victim\u2019s reputation in the community. See Dwyer v. State, 743 So.2d 46, 48 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999) (<HOLDING>) (citations omitted); Melvin v. State, 592 holding that evidence of assault on victim that was subsequent to the arson for which defendant was tried was admissible to show defendants bent of mind toward violence directed at the victimholding that uncharged sexual acts committed upon the same victim are admissible to show the conduct of the defendant toward the victim and to corroborate the evidence of the offense charged in the indictmentholding that a defendant who alleges selfdefense can show through the testimony of another witness that the alleged victim had a propensity for violence thereby inferring that the alleged victim was the aggressor a defendants prior knowledge of the victims reputation for violence is irrelevant because the evidence is offered to show the conduct of the victim rather than the defendants state of mindholding that before a defendant is entitled to introduce evidence of the victims character for violence there must be sufficient evidence to support a finding that the victim was the first aggressor and that once the defendant testified that he was attacked and cut by the victim without provocation before using the victims utility tool to stab the victim the defendant was clearly entitled to question the victim about past acts of violence reflected in court documents from the state of oregonholding that corroborative evidence of prior specific acts of violence by victim may be admissible in selfdefense case where the defendant knew of the act & \n\nRule 29(c)). 9 . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) states, in relevant part; It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014 (1) who has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; ... to ship or transport in interstate or foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce. 10 .It is not clear whether the government attempted to demonstrate that the pistol and rifle were acquired separately and at different times or places. If they did not make such a showing, the indictment under which Alanis was charged would be duplicitous under our recent holding in United States v. Buchmeier, 255 F.3d 415, 422 (7th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The defense did not challenge the indictment holding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involvedholding that when the indictment charges that a certain minimum quantity of drugs is involved in the offense proof of that quantity is a fourth element of the offenseholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violationholding that the quantity of drugs involved in an offense does not support a downward departure because the legislature intended the quantity of drugs to be a determining factor in varying penaltiesholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that count & \n\nreach, where it was readily accessible to him but not to the other occupants of the vehicle. In Taylor, the contraband was in carrying bags that were personal to someone other than the defendant. The lynchpin of the Court\u2019s holding there was that it is not permissible to infer that someone merely occupying a room in which there are carrying bags belonging to another person knows the contents of those personal carrying bags. In this ease, by contrast, the white bag was not personal to someone other than the appellant, to a particular occupant of the car, or to anyone. The kind of evidence that in Taylor negated any reasonable inference of knowledge and possession is not present here. The white bag was an ordinary plastic bag. See Ford v. State, 37 Md.App. 373, 381, 377 A.2d 577 (1977) (<HOLDING>). Officer Webster testified that plastic bags holding the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the juvenile a front seat passenger of a vehicle occupied by four persons was in possession of marijuana recovered from a crumpled piece of newspaper behind the drivers seatholding no unfair prejudice from admission of conviction for possession of 50 to 200 pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute as evidence of intent to distribute cocaineholding that evidence was sufficient to sustain conviction of front seat passenger of possession with intent to distribute marijuana in paper bag in foot well of volkswagen on passengers side near gearshift in presence of marijuana smokeholding that the arresting officer lacked probable cause to arrest defendant a rear seat passenger of a car for possession of marijuana based on the discovery of two marijuana seeds in the front of the vehicleholding the evidence sufficient to support a finding that the defendant a front seat passenger of a vehicle occupied by three individuals was in constructive possession of marijuana found in white bag directly under the defendants seat & \n\nof justice extends to sentencing under section 3C1.1.

However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v.

At the sentencing on January 23, 2009, Peterson challenged the USSG \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(2) enhancement, contending that the enhancement did not apply because her structuring offense did not involve \u201ca pattern of unlawful activity,\u201d which is defined as \u201cat least two separate occasions of unlawful activity ..., without regard to whether any such occasion occurred during the course of the offense or resulted in a conviction for the conduct that occurred on that occasion.\u201d USSG \u00a7 2S1.3, comment, (n.3). According to Peterson, if the structured money came from one source, here her safe deposit box, there could be only one offense, see United States v. Davenport, 929 F.2d 1169, 1172 (7th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>), and thus no pattern of unlawful activity, holding due process clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the charged offense and new york law that requires the defendant in a second degree murder prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter when no element of the charged offense is presumed does not violate the due process clauseholding the proper unit of prosecution for indecent liberties is the number of discrete actsholding that the statute was ambiguous because it provides no definition of the term violation and provides no specific direction as to the proper unit of prosecutionholding that the structuring itself and not each individual deposit is the unit of prosecution in a structuring offenseholding that test for whether two offenses are not the same is whether each offense requires proof of a fact that the other does not & \n\nAlan Pardofigueroa appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment and 27-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction to Conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, Fraud and Misuse of Documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(a), and False Statements, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Pardofigueroa also contends that the district holding guidelines to be only advisoryholding that the preponderance standard is generally appropriate in guidelines sentencingrecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standardholding that the district court determines the amount of loss under the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that under the advisory guidelines a district court should resolve factual disputes at sentencing by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\nit does not necessarily follow that the threat-of-death enhancement would be grafted onto all crimes covered by \u00a7 2B3.1. Furthermore, a reading of the statute under which Jennings was indicted and convicted x-eveals that the threat-of-death enhancement would not be applied in \u201cevery conceivable circumstance\u201d under the statute. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) covers not only individuals who take property from a bank \u201cby force and violence, or by intimidation,\u201d as did Jennings, but also those who obtain property from a bank by extortion and those who enter a bank with the intent to commit a felony therein. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Jennings\u2019s contention also does not recognize the fact that one can commit a robbery with force or intimidation without threatening Uves.

The pre-sentence report stated that the mandatory minimum terms for these convictions were ten and five years, respectively. The Government objected, arguing that Count 10 constituted a second conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) and therefore the mandatory minimum for Count 10 should be 25 years. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)(i) (\u201cIn the case of a second or subsequent conviction under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924], the person shall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.... \u201d); Deal v.

The probation officer agreed with these holding that 924cs enhanced penalty for a second or subsequent conviction applies when the defendant is convicted of multiple 924c counts in a single proceedingholding that post conviction hearing act is not available to juvenile proceeding since the child is not convicted of a crimeholding that issues underlying all counts were sufficiently intertwined that the separate appeal of the summary judgment counts would complicate the trial of the remaining countsholding that where a statute provides for an enhanced penalty based on a defendants prior conviction the fact of conviction is a sentencing factor to be determined by the court rather than a juryholding that severance was not required when a defendant was charged with five counts of forcible rape two counts of felonious restraint three counts of kidnapping two counts of armed criminal action two counts of forcible sodomy one count of second degree assault one count of first degree robbery and one count of stealing & \n\ncrime. In accordance with our reasoning in Mordica, therefore, section 784.045(l)(b) defines a specific intent crime because the statute requires the knowing commission of a battery on a pregnant woman. Appellant is thus correct to argue that the doctrine of transferred intent does not operate in the instant case to elevate V.M.\u2019s general intent to commit a simple battery on her brother to the specific intent required to violate section 784.045(l)(b). See (Mordica, 618 So.2d at 304-05)(\u201cIn this case, the state could not apply the doctrine of transferred intent to enhance the severity of the crime from simple battery to battery of a law enforcement officer by only proving that simple battery against the inmate was intended.\u201d). See also D.J. v. State, 651 So.2d 1255 (Fla. 1st DCA 1995) (<HOLDING>). Nevertheless, we affirm appellant\u2019s holding where school principal was struck while trying to stop student fight transferred intent operates to transfer students intent to commit simple battery on classmate thus negating conviction for attempted battery on school official which requires heightened level of intentholding that battery is an inherently included offense of aggravated batteryholding that under maryland common law an assault is an attempted battery an actual battery or a combination of the twoholding that prior battery was admissible to prove defendants intent to injureholding sentence enhancement statute did not create offense of attempted battery on school employee and thus minors adjudication of delinquency should have been based on finding that minor committed attempted battery & \n\nor coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A). It is undisputed that Ibrahim was convicted of federal crimes of terrorism, and the evidence presented at trial showed that Ibra-him was involved in or intended to promote these crimes, which were intended to influence by means of intimidation and to retaliate against the government of the United States of America. To assess an enhancement for obstruction of justice based on false testimony, \u201ca sentencing court must find that the defendant 1) willfully 2) and materially 3) committed perjury, which is (a) the intentional (b) giving of false testimony (c) as to a material matter.\u201d United States v.

Gonzalez-Lerma, 71 F.3d 1537, 1541 & n. 4 (10th Cir. 1995) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds by United States holding that failure to comply with 851b was harmless in part because defendant did not object to prior convictions listed in presentence reportholding that a sentencing court may warn a defendant of the possibility of a sentence enhancementholding failure to comply with 851b was harmless error in part because defendant did not comply with 851c procedures for challenging prior convictionsholding that the district court lacked authority to revisit the application of the career offender enhancement in a 3582 motion because that enhancement was not affected by a retroactive amendmentholding that failure to comply with 851b was harmless because defendant was properly put on notice that the government was seeking an enhancement and defendant concluded that no valid grounds existed for challenging the convictions or enhancement after research & \n\nBlankenship admits that these prior convictions fall within the class of felonies to which the statute refers, but he contends that they were too remote in time to serve as a proper predicate for enhancement of the sentence. If a statute that imposes a criminal penalty is ambiguous, it must be construed in favor of the defendant. See Bifulco v. United States, 447 U.S. 381, 387, 100 S.Ct. 2247, 2252, 65 L.Ed.2d 205 (1980). However, in this case, section 924(e)(1) is not ambiguous. There is no indication, either in the statute or in the legislative history, that Congress intended to include a temporal restriction in that statute. See United States v. Green, 904 F.2d 654, 655-56 (11th Cir.1990); see also Young v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 690 F.Supp. 990, 995 (S.D.Ala.1988) (<HOLDING>). We refuse to construct such a restriction out holding the use of a 1951 felony conviction as a predicate for a violation of 18 usc 922g1 did not violate the ex post facto clause because the crime of being a felon in possession of a firearm was not committed until after the effective date of the statute under which he was convictedholding that to enhance a sentence because of the defendants use of a firearm the jury must find the defendant guilty of a crime involving a firearm or otherwise specifically find that a firearm was usedholding that because a jury need only agree that a defendant possessed a firearm in order to find a defendant guilty of violating 922g1 a unanimity instruction was not required where defendant was charged with one count of violating 922g1 and multiple firearms were listed in that countholding that period of proscription for firearm ownership under section 922g1 was indefiniteholding that a prior conviction ie one for which the civil right to possess a firearm has not been restored is an element of a 922g1 violation & \n\nonly the quantity of prior convictions, but also the qualitative relationship between the prior convictions and the present homicide conviction. 498 A.2d at 852. Justice Hutchinson suggests that prior felony convictions must be factually similar to the conviction at issue in order to support the aggravating circumstance. Id. This interpretation of the aggravating circumstance by Justice Hutchinson, accepted by only one other Justice, is not binding precedent upon this court. See CRY, Inc. v. Mill Service, Inc., 536 Pa. 462, 640 A.2d 372, 376 n. 3 (1994). Additionally, we specifically rejected reliance upon Holcomb for the argument raised by Appellant in Commonwealth v. Young, 536 Pa. 57, 637 A.2d 1313, 1320-1321 (1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1012, 114 S.Ct. 1389, 128 L.Ed.2d 63 (1994) (<HOLDING>).

State, 696 So.2d 901, 903 (Fla. 4th DCA 1997); Keller v. State, 586 So.2d 1258, 1261-62 (Fla. 5th DCA 1991); Perez v. State, 566 So.2d 881, 884 (Fla. 3d DCA 1990). However, in Chaeld v. State, 599 So.2d 1362, 1364 (Fla. 1st DCA 1992), the court held that a jury instruction based on Faison was not applicable when a charge alleges false imprisonment. The Chaeld court held: This so-call Faison instruction must be given upon the defendant\u2019s request whenever the state charges kidnapping with the intent to commit or facilitate the commission of a felony under \u00a7 787.01(l)(a)2. It has no application when the charge alleges that the defendant kidnapped the victim with any of the other specific intentions identified in \u00a7 787(l)(a)l, 3 or 4. See Bedford v. State, 589 So.2d 245, 251 (Fla.1991) (<HOLDING>). Because the Faison instruction is implicated holding that the fatal injury to a murder victim may be considered as satisfying the bodily injury component of the capital felony of kidnapping with bodily injuryholding that defendant charged with conspiracy to manufacture marijuana and possessing marijuana with intent to distribute was not entitled to specific buyerseller instruction even though support for such instruction existed because court gave a complete instruction reciting all the elements of conspiracyholding that a defendant charged with kidnapping with the intent to inflict bodily harm upon or terrorize the victim is not entitled to a faison instructionholding that the first amendment prohibits criminal sanctions for true statements made with an intent to inflict harmholding that life sentence imposed for kidnapping with bodily injury of 14yearold victim was not cruel and unusual punishment even though bodily injury was slight given circumstances attendant upon offense & \n\nuncertain guide to the meaning of \u201cofficial of the United States.\u201d In fact we need not look to the legislative history to determine the meaning of the term. The provision of the FCA that immediately precedes \u00a7 3731 makes it the duty of the Attorney General to diligently investigate violations of the statute and identifies only private relators and the Attorney General \u2014 not other government agencies \u2014 as parties who may sue under the statute. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(a) & (b)(1). For this reason, we agree with those courts that have concluded that the term \u201cofficial of the United States charged with responsibility to act,\u201d as used in \u00a7 3731(b)(2), means pertinent Department of Justice officials. Accord, United States v. Incorporated Village of Island Park, 791 F.Supp. 354, 363 (E.D.N.Y.1992) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

Id. at 571. Although Becker involved a sentencing enhancement under the Guidelines, at the time the relevant Guidelines section defined \u201ccrime of violence\u201d by reference to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.

As noted above, the officer who frisked Terry did so not because he believed Terry had committed a crime, but because he believed Terry was going to do so. Accordingly, if an officer reasonably suspects a person is about to commit a crime, a protective pat search is warranted in the interests of officer and community safety. United States v. Peep, 490 F.2d 903, 905 (8th Cir. 1974) (concluding a pat search for weapons reasonable when officers knew the defendant had bragged about shooting a police officer); State v. Gobely, 366 N.W.2d 600, 602-03 (Minn. 1985) (<HOLDING>). We are persuaded that the seizure and limited holding noknock search unconstitutional where there was no testimony or evidence that either of the suspects were violent or were known to keep weapons in their homeholding that the 2d11b1 enhancement was proper where a firearm and drugrelated items were found in the defendants residence where he had also engaged in conspiratorial conversationsholding pat search for weapons justified where defendant was in home where stolen items were found and informant reported that in at least one robbery the participants had been armedholding that a warrant authorizing the search of a residence vehicles at the residence and all persons found in the residence was not overly broad given that search was limited to places were drugs or weapons might be foundholding search of armed robbery defendants suitcases and between mattresses of hotel room proper where at time of arrest officers were aware that the defendants had used several different weapons during the robberies and that one weapon a loaded revolver was in plain view concluding officers reasonably feared that someone else was going to come to the room who knew where the other weapons were or that the defendants would position themselves to take advantage of any hidden weapons or instrumentalities & \n\nboat. All six (Martinez-Rios, Ramirez-Fajardo, Castaneda-Marin, Sanchez-Martinez, Ortiz-Cotoa and Carmargo-Silvera) were charged with conspiracy to possess and with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute it in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a) and 1903(j), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Carmargo-Silv-era pled guilty and testified on behalf of the government. The remaining five went to trial and were convicted. Discussion Defendants claim the district court erred by deciding, as a matter of law, that the MS was subject to the jurisdiction of the United States as required by 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a). Defendants claim that jurisdiction is an element of the offense and should have been submitted for determination by the jury. See U.S. v. Ayarza-Garcia, 819 F.2d 1043, 1048-49 (11th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). Defendants claim they objected to the holding that claim construction is an issue of law for the court not a question of fact for the juryholding that generally the question of waiver and estoppel is a question of factrecognizing that under district of columbia law what the parties deem to be the material elements of their agreement either set forth in or absent from those documents is largely a question of fact for the jury and concluding in that case that whether an enforceable oral contract was created and was subsequently breached is a question of fact for the jury to decide not this courtholding it is a question of factholding under predecessor to 46 usc app 1903a that jurisdictional element of crime is question of fact for jury to decide & \n\nspecify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized.\u201d See 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 994(h) (West Supp.1992). The career offender scheme of using a defendant\u2019s criminal record in considering both his offense level and his criminal history under the Sentencing Guidelines bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose \u2014 \u201cto prevent repeat offenders from continuing to victimize society.\u201d John, 936 F.2d at 766-67 n. 2. Consequently, Johns\u2019 due process claim lacks merit. Id.; see also United States v. Erves, 880 F.2d 376, 379 (11th Cir.1989) (rejecting both procedural and substantive due process attacks on sentencing guidelines); United States v. Hawkins, 811 F.2d 210, 217 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 833, 108 S.Ct. 110, 98 L.Ed.2d 69 (1987) (<HOLDING>). Defendant\u2019s equal protection claim is equally holding that defendants sixth amendment right to trial by a jury was not violated by district courts reliance on his prior convictions for purposes of sentencing under the armed career criminal actholding that the armed career criminal designation based on prior convictions does not violate the sixth amendment under bookerholding that a conviction for florida armed robbery is a crime of violence under the armed career criminal actholding sentencing enhancement scheme in armed career criminal amendment to 18 usca 1202a constitutionalholding that application of armed career criminal enhancement falls within exception for prior convictions where facts were undisputed making it unnecessary to engage in further fact finding about a prior conviction & \n\n(emphases added). Thus, contrary to Vester\u2019s contention on appeal, the United States Supreme Court has made a clear distinction between \u201cuncounseled\u201d convictions, and those that were secured with \u201cineffective\u201d counsel. Accordingly, Yester\u2019s claim that his \u201cineffective counsel\u201d amounted to \u201cno counsel,\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and collateral attack on his prior convictions, must fail. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court explicitly held in Custis that the right to collaterally attack a prior criminal conviction in a subsequent proceeding for enhancement purposes is limited to the actual denial of counsel. Id.; see also Daniels v. United States, 532 U.S. 374, 378, 121 S.Ct. 1578, 1581, 149 L.Ed.2d 590 (2001); United States v. Simpson, 94 F.3d 1373, 1381 (10th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). Although the Custis decision concerned the recognizing collateral attack on void orderholding that a judgment as to the title in a prior litigation was not subject to collateral attackholding that where a defendants claim did not amount to a complete denial of counsel it could not form the basis of a collateral attackholding that when the law of the circuit was so firmly against him petitioner did not have to raise an issue to preserve it as a basis for collateral attack later onholding that the complete denial of counsel on direct appeal requires a finding of prejudice & \n\npredicate to enhance his sentence as a second-offense habitual offender. While defendant objects to this, he offers no statutory or legal analysis to support the contention that his claimed double enhancement is inappropriate. The critical point from Bewersdorf is that the OUIL provisions increased the punishment for each repeated offense, just as the SORA provisions do in the present case. In fact, defendant concedes that there is no error in enhancing a SORA-2 sentence under the habitual-offender provisions as long as the habitual-offender enhancement is based on a felony other than a SORA violation. Thus, to this extent, defendant agrees with our conclusion that MCL 28.729(1) sets forth separate, elevated offenses. 51 E.g., People v Eilola, 179 Mich App 315, 325; 445 NW2d 490 (1989) (<HOLDING>); People v Brown, 186 Mich App 350, 357; 463 holding that the habitualoffender provisions could be used to enhance a sentence for a conviction that constituted firstdegree retail fraud because of a prior conviction mcl 750356c2 as added by 1988 pa 20holding an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid because no prison term was imposed and the conviction may be used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent offenseholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding the death sentence proportional for the firstdegree murder conviction where the aggravators included prior violent felony conviction and hacholding that any fact other than a prior conviction may not be used to enhance a defendants sentence beyond the statutory maximum unless it is submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt & \n\nSee id. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2047-48. A hypothetical illustrates the efficacy of a unitary standard of review. If a district court were to depart upward based upon physical injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2, p.s., we might conclude that it had abused its discretion if the underlying offense were obstruction of justice, because the guideline applicable to that offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(1), provides for an eight-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved caus[es] ... physical injury to a person.\u201d Our review in such a situation would amount to a de novo review of the applicable guideline to determine whether, as a matter of law, it takes physical injury into account. See United States v. Rybicki, 96 F.3d 754, 758 (4th Cir.1996) (noting that when the determinat (4th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 956, 136 holding that downward departure based on defendants restitution was improper because restitution is taken into consideration in assessing whether acceptance of responsibility adjustment should apply and district court abused its discretion in finding defendants restitution was extraordinaryholding apprendi inapplicable to restitution orders because restitution for harm done is a classic civil remedyholding that district court may not depart downward to preserve defendants ability to make restitutionholding no restitution hearing is mandated when defendant did not object to order of restitution or request a hearingholding that equitable restitution is available but that legal restitution is not & \n\n"}

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements. Given that role, Stern had a duty to disclose any known information necessary to prevent the Official Statements from being false or misleading. See Howard, 228 F.3d at 1061 (<HOLDING>).

Howard & Howard communicated its representations via telephone calls and emails. Although the two paragraphs cobble together a few details, they fail to give even one date on which an alleged misrepresentation occurred. That alone dooms ABI\u2019s ability to allege fraud with particularity. See Heinrich, 668 F.3d at 393 (finding that a plaintiff failed to allege fraud with sufficient particularity because she \u201cd[id] not include [in her affidavit] the date she received the allegedly fraudulent email from the defendants.\u201d); see also United States ex rel.

The court finds these alleged statements insufficient because they are unaccompanied by facts which demonstrate their accuracy or Defendants\u2019 involvement or control in their preparation. Moreover, as recently determined by one court in this district: \u201ca plaintiff cannot meet the requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) merely by pleading the specific time, place, and contents of misleading statements by a specifically identified analyst. Rather, to hold a defendant liable for misleading statements published by a third party, the plaintiff must at least identify the defendant who provided the information that the third party made public to the market.\u201d Barrie, 2002 WL 1841631, * 3; see also Suna v.

While all three of these crimes connote some element of dishonesty, they do not necessarily involve fraud per se. So, as a general matter, they would be subject to the general notice pleading standard. Rose v. Bartle, 871 F.2d 331, 356 (3d Cir.1989) (\u201cThus, the suggestion that \u2018[a] charge of racketeering, with its implications of links to organized crime, should not be easier to make than accusations of fraud appears unwarranted.\u2019 \u201d) For that reason, each would not be subjected to the higher pleading standard required of fraud. See Republic of Colombia v. Diageo North America, Inc., 531 F.Supp.2d 365, 382 (E.D.N.Y.2007) (<HOLDING>); see Muscletech Research and Dev., Inc., v. holding that charge of money laundering need not satisfy rule 9bholding a complaint failed to satisfy rule 9b where the allegations were lacking in detailholding plaintiffs speculations did not satisfy rule 9b requirementsholding that specific details about time place and substance of the fraud satisfy rule 9bholding a broad claim with no factual support was insufficient to satisfy rule 9b & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\n289, 292 (5th Cir.1981)] or (3) when the government no longer has a mortgage or a lien upon the property in dispute when the suit was filed, [citing Koehler, 153 F.3d at 266-67].\u201d Hussain, 311 F.3d at 629-30. Furthermore, if the complaint or pleading does not set forth with particularity the nature of the government\u2019s interest showing that it has or claims to have a lien or mortgage against the property that is the subject of the suit, the complaint fails to satisfy the conditions necessary to waive the sovereign immunity of the United States and invoke federal jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(b) (\u201cThe complaint or pleading shall set forth with particularity the nature of the interest or lien of the United States.\u201d); see also Dahn v.

Plaintiffs filed their complaint in state court on September 23, 1998. Under Michigan law, a cause of action accrues when the plaintiff can allege each element of the asserted claim. Moll v. Abbott Labs., 444 Mich. 1, 506 N.W.2d 816, 824 (Mich.1993). Further, Michigan courts apply the discovery rule, whereby a claim accrues when the plaintiff discovers, or through the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have discovered, an injury and causal connection between his injury and the defendant\u2019s conduct. Id. (discussing discovery rule in the context of a products liability action); Agristor Fin. Corp. v. Van Sickle, 967 F.2d 233, 236-38 (6th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). In the instant case, the record suggests that recognizing applicability of discovery ruleholding that a discovery exception to a statute of limitation applies only to the discovery of facts not discovery of the lawholding that the time of discovery of fraud is not a proper matter for summary judgmentrecognizing that the heck deferred accrual rule applies to fourteenth amendment equal protection claimsholding that discovery accrual rule applies to causes of action under michigan law for fraud & \n\nof statements is unnecessary when the fraud allegations arise from misstatements or omissions in group-published documents, such as Annual Reports, prospectuses, registration statements, press releases, or other \u2018group published information\u2019 that presumably constitute the collective actions of those individuals involved in the day-to-day affairs of the corporation. Although the Third Circuit has not ruled on whether the group pleading doctrine has survived the enactment of the PSLRA, the district courts in this Circuit favor the conclusion that it has not.

Lead Plaintiff claims that it does not rely holding that the encounter between an officer and the defendant did not rise to the level of a terry stop until the defendant gave the officer his license and the officer informed the defendant that he was going to be given a patdownholding that the plaintiff sufficiently pleaded a violation of the fcra based on extraneous information where it was alleged that the document included broad language regarding disclosure of the information the accuracy of the information the consequences of providing a false statement and the effect of a photocopyholding that in connection with a motion to dismiss the court may consider a document not attached to the pleadings where the plaintiffs claim depends on the contents of a document the defendant attaches the document to its motion to dismiss and the parties do not dispute the authenticity of the document even though the plaintiff does not explicitly allege the contents of that document in the complaintholding that failure to identify the defendant in the information is an omission of an essential element because the primary purpose of the charging document is to inform the defendant of the nature of the accusations brought against himholding that the group pleading doctrine is valid when applied to officers where it is almost certain that given the highlevel position of the officer within the company and the nature of the published writing that he would have been involved directly with writing the document or approving its content and that the officer was privy to information concerning the accuracy of the statements within the document & \n\nis subjected to the heightened pleading standard of Iqbal and Twombly \u201d). Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations. A claim of indirect infringement, on the other hand, will presumably have met the relatively stringent standards of Twombly and Iqbal, and will allege specific facts showing how the defendant is alleged to have induced or cont Inc., No. CV 11-7658, 2012 WL 681765, at *3 (C.D.Cal.

All of these versions of fraud share the common element of a false statement of fact. In the present case, Plaintiff has not alleged any statement attributable to Womack that was false. Plaintiff does allege that, \u201cDefendants engaged in an aggressive advertising campaign throughout Virginia touting its self-proclaimed honesty and fair dealing to prospective consumers, including the Plaintiffs.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 4.) While this amounts to an assertion by Defendants, it is not an assertion of fact. It is well established that such an expression of opinion \u201cis no fraud.\u201d McMillion v.

We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm. Pardofigueroa contends that the district court erred by applying a preponderance of the evidence standard, rather than the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, when determining whether the factual predicate for a sentencing enhancement had been met. This contention is foreclosed by United States v. Kilby, 443 F.3d 1135, 1143 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Pardofigueroa also contends that the district holding guidelines to be only advisoryholding that the preponderance standard is generally appropriate in guidelines sentencingrecognizing that sentencing facts are based on the evidence and testimony presented at sentencing under a preponderance of the evidence standardholding that the district court determines the amount of loss under the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that under the advisory guidelines a district court should resolve factual disputes at sentencing by applying the preponderance of the evidence standard & \n\nthat only rules of damages are substantive. Prior to Monessen, the United States Supreme Court had already decided that prejudgment interest is a form of \u201cactual damages\u201d and that damages are substantive. See id. Thus, no further analysis was needed to determine that prejudgment interest was substantive. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has found other state laws that have no relationship to damages to be substantive in FELA cases. See, e.g., Dice v. Akron, Canton & Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S. 359, 363, 72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398 (1952) (concluding that the right to have a jury decide factual issues of fraud is \u201ctoo substantial a part of the rights accorded by [FELA] to permit it to be classified as a mere local rule of procedure\u2019 \u201d); Brown, 338 U.S. at 299, 70 S.Ct. 105 (<HOLDING>); White, 238 U.S. at 511-12, 35 S.Ct. 865 holding that state courts must apply the federal pleading standard in fela casesholding that in diversity cases federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural lawholding that litigants may enforce fela in state courts as a matter of right but also observing that state courts are free to apply their own modes of procedure to fela casesrecognizing that the federal pleading standard is a less stringent standard than the delaware pleading standardholding that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity cases & \n\nas \"a substantial likelihood that, under all the circumstances, the omitted fact would have assumed actual significance in the deliberations of the reasonable [investor].\u201d TSC Indus., Inc. v.

The alleged concealment of both the conflict of interest, Press, 218 F.3d at 130, and the excessive commissions, Ettinger, 835 F.2d at 1033, satisfy the materiality requirement. 55 . While the QPA-2 and the fixed portions of the other annuities were not \"securities\u201d under federal securities laws, because they were part of the putative pay-to-play scheme, they cannot be used to support a civil RICO claim. See Bald Eagle, 189 F.3d at 329-30 (<HOLDING>). As such, the Court rejects Plaintiff's holding breach of best execution duty is a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of the securitiesholding that a plaintiff alleging securities fraud must show that a defendant 1 made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he or she had a duty to speak 2 with scienter 3 in connection with the purchase or sale of securitiesholding that evidence was sufficient to support convictions for willfully engaging in fraudulent conduct in connection with sale of securities because kjnowledge that the act violates the securities laws is not relevantholding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase sale or issuance of the instrumentholding that 1 even if some conduct is not actionable as securities fraud that conduct cannot support a civil rico claim if it was also undertaken in connection with the purchase of a security and 2 conduct in maintaining ponzi scheme was conduct undertaken in connection with the purchase or sale of securities & \n\nthe alternative method of demonstrating scienter\u2014 motive \u2014 has not been established. Plaintiffs contend that the Andersen defendants were motivated to participate in the fraud because of personal gain. However, they have alleged no gain other than the fact that the Andersen firm was compensated for its professional services. It would defy common sense to hold that the motive element of the Beck scienter analysis would be satisfied merely by alleging the receipt of normal compensation for professional services rendered, because to do so would effectively abolish the requirement, as against professional defendants in a securities fraud action, of pleading facts which support a strong inference of scienter. Cf. Wilson v. Saintine Exploration and Drilling Corp., 872 F.2d 1124 (2d Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the Section 10(b) claim is holding that a professional owes no duty to third persons unless the professional had actual knowledge that those persons would rely on his rendering of professional servicesholding professional malpractice claim not contractualholding that ijnsurance policies are contracts and as such they are to be enforced according to their provisions and ijnsurance companies must be able to rely on their statements of coverage exclusions disclaimers definitions and other provisions in order to receive the benefit of their bargainholding that professional defendants who merely perform their usual professional functions and receive their normal compensation are not liable under the draconian provisions of section 122holding that 1 principal shareholder and chief executive officer of chapter 11 debtor in liquidation is not entitled to compensation beyond normal salary for performing duties required of the debtor 2 professional is a term which is not narrowly construed but applies to anyone the nature of whose services meet the criteria of a professional person 3 a professional license is not dispositive and 4 factors include form of compensation time of retention pre or postpetition and whether employment is full time or parttime & \n\ndard or limitation that Esso is allegedly violating under CWA.

However, the Second Circuit has held that \u201cthe existence, without more, of executive compensation dependent upon stock value does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter.\u201d Acito v.

Indeed, the Second Circuit has made clear holding that financial gain from compensation for professional services is not a sufficient motive for purposes of pleading scienterholding the pslra standard for pleading scienter is more stringent than the second circuits standard prior to the act and that motive and opportunity is not an independent basis to show defendants had scienterholding that access to financial information was reasonably related to a defendants narcotics convictions because financial gain motivated the underlying crimesholding that in pleading scienter arguing that the motive for defrauding investors was to increase the companys profits or to increase officer compensation is not sufficientholding that allegations of motive and opportunity were not enough to create a strong inference of scienter & \n\n28 (2d Cir.1991). A. The Civil Rights Claims Legal Aid argues that plaintiffs allegations concerning the violation of his civil rights by Legal Aid should be dismissed on the ground that Legal Aid has not acted under color of state law, as required to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In order to survive a motion to dismiss, a plaintiff pleading a claim under \u00a7 1983 need allege only that \u201csome person acting under color of state law deprived the claimant of a federal right.\u201d Green v.

If Plaintiffs are able to show fraud on the part of First Boston, it might be held liable for all or part of the claim against BMC, even though it would not be liable for the particular relief sought. The power to implead First Boston based on its fraud as an agent of BMC should not be limited by the form of the remedy requested in the Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint, especially when, as here, the relief sought is a lump sum of $30,000,000 minus the value of the Notes.

The specific safeguards provided by the statute to prevent disclosure lend weight to the argument that public dissemination of the test results would cause emotional distress, and thus Continental should have known that by sending the results in an unsecured fax, it was risking causing great emotional distress to the Abrils if an unauthorized party saw the test results. Because the only reasonable damages arising from a breach of section 381.004(3)(f) are emotional distress, and because this emotional damage would be akin to that suffered by victims of defamation or invasion of privacy, we conclude they should not be barred by the impact rule.

As to loss of use, Defendant contends that Plaintiff cannot show any loss of use of its property as a result of C8 contamination. Throughout litigation, Plaintiff has argued that the C8 contamination interfered with its Five-Year Plan, originally drafted in 1995, which includes the blueprint to expand its water supply to three areas: Decatur Township 250, Barlow Township 261, and Palmer Square. Further, Plaintiff has alleged that the C8 contamination hindered its plans to drill a new production well. First, regarding the Five-Year Plan, Defendant responds that the Plaintiff cannot sustain an injury under private nuisance to expand into land it does not yet own. Gevelaar v.

Because she does not seek to bring an action as an individual, the Court need only address her ability to assert an Unruh Act claim on behalf of Kyler. RCHSD relies on cases that address an organization\u2019s standing under Unruh to argue that Ms. Prescott lacks standing to assert a claim on behalf of Kyler.

With respect to the latter requirement, the Supreme Court has held that [a] private plaintiff may not recover damages under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act merely by showing \u201cinjury causally linked to an illegal presence in the market.\u201d Instead, a plaintiff must prove the existence of \u201cantitrust injury, which is to say injury of the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flows from that which makes defendants\u2019 acts unlawful.\u201d Atlantic Richfield Co., 495 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1884 (quoting Brunswick Corp. 429 U.S. at 489, 97 S.Ct. 690 (internal citations omitted)); see also J.

In Murphy v.

The consequences of the trespass should have been reflected in the market value of the property when plaintiff acquired it. After reviewing the record, the court finds that the trespass was permanent. Thus, the injury occurred in July 1998, before plaintiff owned the property. As the subsequent landowner, plaintiff lacks standing to sue for injuries that occurred before his ownership \u2014 the previous owner was the party who was actually harmed by the prior injury. See, e.g., Denman, 2005 WL 2316177, at *4 (<HOLDING>).

Therefore, a state law is preempted if it adds to the judicial remedies available under ERISA. Id. (citing Rush Prudential, 536 U.S. at 379, 122 S.Ct. 2151). The Kentucky Act essentially creates a statutory bad faith claim. Cummings v. Thomas Industries, Inc., 812 F.Supp. 99, 101 (W.D.Ky.1993) (citing State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Reeder, 763 S.W.2d 116, 118 (Ky.1988)). A plaintiff may recover \u201csuch damages as he sustained by reason of the violation\u201d of the Act. Ky.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 446.070. The plain language of this statute permits, at a bare minimum, compensatory damages. In addition, a plaintiff can recover damages for anxiety and mental anguish. FB Ins. Co. v. Jones, 864 S.W.2d 926, 929 (Ky.Ct.App.1993) (<HOLDING>). By comparison, ERISA limits plaintiffs holding that wifes recovery for loss of consortium should not be reduced by the proportion of negligence attributable to husband because claim for loss of consortium is independent of the damages claim of the injured spouseholding the trial court did not err by instructing the jury that the plaintiff could be awarded damages for anxiety mental anguish and loss of consortium for a violation of the kentucky actrecognizing cause of action for loss of consortiumholding that trial court did not errrecognizing loss of consortium claims & \n\nthat Title VII hostile work environment plaintiffs need not prove a pattern, \u201csteady barrage,\u201d or other minimum quantum of discriminatory conduct in order to establish actionable harassment.

A defendant is liable to a claimant only for the percentage of the damages found by the trier of fact equal to that defendant\u2019s percentage of responsibility unless the percentage of responsibility attributed to the defendant is greater than 50% or the defendant engaged in particular conduct listed in the penal code. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.013(a), (b) (West 2008). Here, the jury found LMS 30% responsible and found Hospital 60% responsible. Based on our above holding that legally insufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s joint enterprise finding and the fact that the jury assessed only 30% responsibility against LMS, LMS cannot be jointly and severally liable with Hospital for the entire judgment.

B. Count Thirteen: Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA) Clear Channel and Koplik move for summary judgment on the plaintiffs CUTPA claim on the ground that Goldsich does not fall within the class of persons that CUTPA is intended to protect.

See Larsen Chelsey Realty Co. v. Larsen, 232 Conn. 480, 496, 656 A.2d 100 7, at *5 (D.Conn.1995) (<HOLDING>).

The holding in Heller is very limited, however, and the Court did not address whether (1) the Second Amendment applies to the states; (2) the individual right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right; or (3) strict scrutiny or intermediate scrutiny is the proper standard of review. In assessing the validity of appellant\u2019s claim, we must first address the reach of the Second Amendment. \u201cIt is settled law ... that the Second Amendment applies only to limitations the federal government seeks to impose on this right.\u201d Maloney v. Cuomo, 554 F.3d 56, 58 (2nd Cir.2009). See also, Bach v. Pataki, 408 F.3d 75, 84 (2d Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>); State v.

In making this decision, the district court must draw all reasonable inferences arising from the proof, and resolve all factual disputes, in favor of the plaintiff. Id. For actions removed to federal court from the state courts of North Carolina, the personal jurisdiction inquiry requires the court to ask whether its exercise of jurisdiction over an individual interferes with that individual\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process liberty interests. Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. v. Delta Int\u2019l Corp., 696 F.2d 1062, 1065 (4th Cir.1982) (the two-step personal jurisdiction analysis is collapsed into a single question of due process in actions removed to federal court from North Carolina) (citing Dillon v. Numismatic Funding Corp., 291 N.C. 674, 231 S.E.2d 629, 630 (1977) (<HOLDING>)) One surviving claim against the Individual holding plaintiffs allegation that defendants committed torts in texas was sufficient to bring defendants under the longarm statuteholding the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment extends the right to jury trial to defendants in serious criminal cases in state courtsholding that proof of fraud necessarily establishes a violation of north carolinas unfair and deceptive trade practices statute nc gemstat 7511holding that north carolinas longarm statute extends to the limits of due processrecognizing that the ohio longarm statute does not extend to the limits of due process and focusing the inquiry on whether defendant established sufficient business contacts with ohio & \n\nsee id. at 74-75, 21 L.Ed. 394. The former include only rights the Federal Constitution grants or the national government enables, but not those preexisting rights the Bill of Rights merely protects from federal invasion. Id. at 76-80, 21 L.Ed. 394. The Second Amendment protects a right that predates the Constitution; therefore, the Constitution did not grant it. See, e.g., Heller, 128 S.Ct. at 2797 (\u201c[I]t has always been widely understood that the Second Amendment, like the First and Fourth Amendments, codified a pre-existing right.\u201d). It necessarily follows that the Privileges or Immunities Clause did not protect the right to keep and bear arms because it was not a right of citizens of the United States. See Cruikshank, 92 U.S. at 553; cf. Presser, 116 U.S. at 266-67, 6 S.Ct. 580 (<HOLDING>). 3 The final avenue for incorporation is that recognizing a right to associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political social economic educational religious and cultural endsholding that the right to associate with others as a military company is not a privilege of citizens of the united statesrecognizing even federal constitutional right of association does not apply to the right of one individual to associate with anotherholding that the plaintiff must demonstrate that defendants contacts with the united states as a whole support the exercise of jurisdiction consistent with the constitution and laws of the united statesholding that the fourteenth amendment which makes persons bom in the united states and subject to its jurisdiction citizens of the united states and requires that representatives be apportioned among the states based on population excluding indians not taxed did not make an indian a citizen of the united states & \n\nalso explained herein. 7 . The Court considers Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of a Fifth Amendment right to privacy as analogous and indistinguishable from the courts have recognized as a Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy. See Flaskamp v. Dearborn Pub. Schs., 385 F.3d 935, 941-42 (6th Cir.2004) (explaining that intimate association and privacy rights find protection in the substantive component of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause (citing Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984) and Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 562, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003))). Courts have recognized that there are associational freedoms attached to the First Amendment. Christensen v. County of Boone, Il., 483 F.3d 454, 462 (7th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). However, the freedom to enter into holding that njeither the right to associate nor the right to participate in political activities is absolute and congress may prohibit federal employees from participating in political activities in view of its interest in maintaining a nonpartisan work forceholding that regulating the location of adult films does not violate the first amendment and citing as support the proposition that reasonable regulations of the time place and manner of protected speech where those regulations are necessary to further significant governmental interests are permitted by the first amendmentrecognizing first amendment retaliation rightrecognizing a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the first amendment citing jaycees 468 us at 618 104 sct 3244recognizing even federal constitutional right of association does not apply to the right of one individual to associate with another & \n\nequally unavailing. Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he denied defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance so that he might have time to obtain a valid license. The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred when he denied his pretrial motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. He says that the trial justice denied the motion based \u201con an opinion not fact.\u201d Kowal has offered only a vague religiously oriented argument about why the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction over him. He has directed us to no legal authority that supports his position. In the furtherance of public safety, \u00a7 31-11-18 equally applies to defendant as it does to all other motor-vehicle operators in Rhode Island. See State v. Garvin, 945 A.2d 821, 824 (R.I.2008) (<HOLDING>). We are satisfied that the trial justice\u2019s holding that 311118 applied to the defendant regardless of his unwillingness to recognize the federal governmentrecognizing that stateimposed restrictions upon property may be attributed to the federal government for purposes of a takings analysis where the state officials acted as agents of the federal government or pursuant to federal authorityholding the fourteenth amendment does not apply to the actions of the federal governmentholding that a defendant must demonstrate that the governments intrusion upon his relationship with his attorney created a possibility of either injury to his defense or benefit to the government in order to establish a violation of the right to counselholding that without such a showing the government may only charge the defendant with one violation of 922g1 regardless of the actual quantity of firearms involved & \n\nexplained: Where a particular amendment' \u201cprovides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection\u201d against a particular sort of governmental behavior \u201cthat Amendment, not the more generalized notion of \u2018substantive due process,\u2019 must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\u201d We think this principle is likewise applicable here. The Framers considered the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty, and drafted the Fourth Amendment to address it. Id. at 273, 114 S.Ct. 807 (quoting Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 395, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989)); see e.g. Uboh v. Reno, 141 F.3d 1000, 1003 (11th Cir.1998) (characterizing a malicious prosecution claim as being based on the Fourth rather than Fourteenth Amendment); Tinney v. Shores, 77 F.3d 378, 380-381 (11th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). Here, Sims alleges the same facts in support holding that the plaintiffs claim that city encouraged private individuals to trespass on the plaintiffs land was properly a fourth amendment rather than a substantive due process claimholding that there is no fourteenth amendment substantive due process right to be free from malicious prosecution and suggesting that such a cause of action might lie under the fourth amendmentrecognizing that the integrity of the family unit has found protection in the due process clause of the fourteenth amendmentholding that the plaintiffs fourteenth amendment substantive due process claim was foreclosed because the fourth amendment provided protection for their claim that law enforcement officers participated in an unlawful seizure of their mobile homerecognizing 1983 substantive due process claim & \n\n98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978); Uniforce Temporary Personnel, Inc. v.

Florida Power & Light Co., 76 F.3d 1560, 1563 n. 1 (11th Cir.), modified, 86 F.3d 1028 (1996). Based on the aforementioned order, this appeal was presented to this court for decision on the merits. II. DISCUSSION The issue presented here is whether this court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to the collateral order doctrine announced in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Defendants sought a certificate for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) , but were denied. Thus, this court has juri , 87 L.Ed. 315 (1943) (<HOLDING>). The inquiry becomes whether the Act grants a holding that state could not assert sovereign immunity defense where the state had waived immunity in state court and agreed to remove suit to federal courtholding that as a general rule interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity governmental immunity public official immunity statutory immunity or any other type of immunity are not appealable under the maryland collateral order doctrineholding that a district courts order is final and immediately reviewable under mitchell if the appellants properly raised a claim of qualified immunity in the district courtholding that stateaction immunity issues immunity from federal statutes not intended to restrain state action or official action directed by a state are immediately appealable under cohen and mitchellholding that while the fourteenth amendment is directed against state action and not private action the state action requirement is met in a civil action where state law is applied whether by statute or common law & \n\nfinding, the Court declines to determine whether a jury could find reasonably that Lee violated De Contreras\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant Lee on De Contreras\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. B. De Contreras\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Claim Against Lee and Mastaler for Fabricating Police Reports The record lacks any evidence to support Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Lee or Mastaler fabricated their police reports. Furthermore, as De Contreras was convicted on the charges alleged in the police reports (see April 9, 2012 Minute Order Granting Motion to Dismiss at 7 (Doc. No. 42)), he cannot now challenge the validity of those police reports under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. See Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994) (<HOLDING>) Thus, Defendants are entitled to summary holding that a plaintiff requesting relief under 1983 had no cause of action unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed expunged invalidated or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpusholding that to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a 42 usc 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal or called into question by federal courts issuance of writ of habeas corpus footnote omittedrecognizing that 1983 action does not accrue until conviction or sentence has been invalidatedholding that a claim for damages that would invalidate a conviction or sentence that has not already been invalidated or reversed on direct appeal by executive order by an authorized state tribunal or by a writ of habeas corpus is not cognizable under 1983holding that in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal courts issuance of a writ of habeas corpus & \n\nprong of the Collins [v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992)] test, the panel opinion did not apply the first prong \u2014 establishing an underlying constitutional violation.\u201d). Indeed, some courts have actively cabined Fagan to its facts and held that, generally, plaintiffs may not pursue a municipal .liability claim without any concomitant individual liability. See, e.g., DeNinno v. Municipality of Penn Hills, 269 Fed.Appx. 153, 158 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cEven more fundamentally, there can be no municipal liability here because we have determined that none of the individual defendants violated the Constitution.\u201d) (citing Grazier, 328 F.3d at 124 n. 5); Cole ex rel. Cole v. Big Beaver Falls Area Sch. Dist, 2009 WL 3807185, at *8 (W.D.Pa.

Trail, 163 So.3d at 276. Although the MHSAA is a private, voluntary association, it is uniquely situated due to its substantial entwinement with government. By statute, the local school boards are empowered to regulate athletic programs. Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 S7-7-301(q). (Rev.2013). But the school-boards have delegated their statutory authority to regulate athletics to the MHSAA. Miss. High Sch. Activities Ass\u2019n. v. Coleman, 631 So.2d 768, 774 (Miss.1994). And because the MHSAA\u2019s authority is derived from statutory authority, its actions are \u201cstate action for the purpose of constitutional analysis.\u201d Id.; see also Brentwood Acad. v. Tenn.

Lucas names no individual officers. The Ex Parte Young exception applies only in actions against individual state officers, and not to state agencies. See id. Therefore, the Ex Parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is inapplicable here, thus barring action against the Board. For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM the dismissal of the declaratory judgment by the District Court. 1 . On appeal, Lucas cites two exceptions to the doctrine of Ex Parte Young. See Idaho v.

Following the Supreme Court\u2019s holing in Graham, the First Circuit Court of Appeals has rejected alleged deprivations of substantive due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment based either on excessive force or on malicious prosecution. Estate of Bennett v. Wainwright, 548 F.3d 155 (1st Cir.2008) (dismissing a substantive due process claim for deprivation of a life interest because the claim was based on excessive force more appropriately brought under the Fourth Amendment); Torres-Rivera v.

Id. Additionally, it is fundamental that a general statute does not apply and must yield when there is a specific statute addressing a particular subject matter. Id. Appellant\u2019s argument is that \u00a7 5-64-403 is unconstitutionally vague because it authorizes different penalties for the same conduct: possession of drug paraphernalia with intent to manufacture methamphetamine. However, the legislature may authorize different maximum penalties for the same conduct if the law clearly defines the conduct prohibited. Further, the punishment authorized is not unconstitutional merely because a statute contains overlapping provisions authorizing different maximum penalties. United States v.

The only exception to this doctrine occurs where the statute on which the federal cause of action is based constitutes an express or implied repeal of \u00a7 1738. We find no evidence of such a repeal in ERISA. Though we are not required to do so by the text of \u00a7 1738, federal common law requires us to give preclusive effect to the determinations of a state administrative agency acting in a judicial capacity.

United States, 152 F.3d 998 (D.C.Cir. 1998), on reh\u2019g, 173 F.3d 898 (D.C.Cir. 1999), is inconsistent with the Navegar line of cases. As the court explained, however, the plaintiff police officers in that case complained of an ongoing constitutional injury due to the conflict between local law enforcement duties and the federal law at issue. See Fraternal Order, 152 F.3d at 1001. Navegar and its progeny, as well as the present case, deal with the potential of prosecutions that could cause injury only in the future, if at all. 4 . Plaintiffs in each case asked for and were granted dismissal without prejudice rather than transfer so that they could appeal immediately. They did appeal, but neither appeal was successful. See Dearth v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 413 (6th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>); Hodgkins v. Mukasey, 271 Fed.Appx. 412 (5th holding that a plaintiff generally may not appeal a voluntary dismissal without prejudice because it is not an involuntary adverse judgment against himholding that a voluntary dismissal moots a caseholding that this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a stipulated voluntary dismissal with prejudice unless it was intended to settle the caseholding appeal improper since the dismissal was voluntaryholding the plain legal prejudice test applies to voluntary dismissal under the code & \n\ndays of receiving the notice of right to sue). Ms. Scott never served the defendant in that case, and the court dismissed it without prejudice on January 21, 2000. Ms. Scott filed a second lawsuit on July 21, 2000. However, Ms. Scott also did not serve the defendant in the second case, and the court dismissed it without prejudice on February 6, 2001. This circuit has held \u201cthat the filing of a complaint that is dismissed without prejudice does not toll the statutory filing period of Title VII.\u201d Brown, 926 F.2d at 961. We reasoned that \u201cas a general rule, a voluntary dismissal without prejudice leaves the parties as though the action had never been brought.\u201d Id. Other courts have applied this rule to ADA claims, see Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods., Inc., 139 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). As the district court observed, application holding that a review committee of the kansas board for discipline of attorneys had the authority to dismiss a complaint against an attorney with or without prejudice and when dismissal was ordered without specifying the nature of the dismissal the dismissal was without prejudice to the filing of later proceedings on the same matterholding that the dismissal without prejudice of the plaintiffs first action doomed his ada claim because the ninetyday filing period had runholding that proper remedy for failure to exhaust is dismissal of the claim without prejudiceholding borough could not appeal dismissal of complaint without prejudice because dismissal without prejudice is comparable to a nonsuit under the former practice of lavf holding district court had no authority to require plaintiffs to obtain courts permission to dismiss defendant who had not served answer or motion for summary judgment as plaintiffs had absolute right to dismissal without prejudice and thus court could not sanction plaintiffs for filing notice of voluntary dismissal rather than motion & \n\nCURIAM: Robert Holland Koon seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing without prejudice his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 (2000) petition pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(2). The district court\u2019s order stemmed from Koon\u2019s request that the court dismiss his petition without prejudice in order to allow him to exhaust his state remedies. A Rule 41(a)(2) voluntary dismissal without prejudice is not appealable. See Unioil, Inc. v. E.F. Hutton & Co., 809 F.2d 548, 555 (9th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>), overruled in part on other grounds by Moore holding borough could not appeal dismissal of complaint without prejudice because dismissal without prejudice is comparable to a nonsuit under the former practice of lavf holding that dismissal of a pro se complaint for failure to state a claim should generally be without prejudice but if the plaintiff has been given an opportunity amend his complaint and fails to do so the dismissal may be with prejudiceholding that this court has jurisdiction over an appeal from a stipulated voluntary dismissal with prejudice unless it was intended to settle the caseholding that a plaintiff generally may not appeal a voluntary dismissal without prejudice because it is not an involuntary adverse judgment against himholding appeal improper since the dismissal was voluntary & \n\nas required by the terms of the Distribution Agreement. IV. CONCLUSION The plain language of the Distribution Agreement compels a conclusion that the right of first refusal does not apply in a dissolution action where the court-appointed receiver is procuring the sale of the corporate assets. The receiver, not the survivor or the personal representative, is the procuring party, and the receiver\u2019s actions are taken under the supervision, and with the approval, of the trial court. Had the parties to the Distribution Agreement intended for the right of first refusal to apply in the context of a corporate dissolution, or where a third party was procuring a buyer, the Distribution Agreement could have so provided. See, e.g., Roof Depot, Inc. v. Ohman, 638 N.W.2d 782 (Minn.Ct. App.2002) (<HOLDING>); Guice v. Sentinel Tech., Inc., 294 Ill. holding transfer restriction granted right of first refusal in event of voluntary or involuntary transfer of stockholding such intoxication to be voluntaryholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that title vii is subject to the transfer provisions of section 1404aholding that a plaintiff generally may not appeal a voluntary dismissal without prejudice because it is not an involuntary adverse judgment against him & \n\nCourts in rendering opinions\u201d on certain matters). This court concludes that, under Hawaii law, if an underlying action is dismissed against a nonconsenting defendant because it was a necessary condition of settlement with the other defendants in the underlying litigation, the dismissal with prejudice is not a dismissal on the substantive merits of the case and is therefore not a termination in favor of the nonconsenting defendant for malicious prosecution purposes. See Villa, 6 Cal.Rptr.2d at 649 (finding that \u201ceven where a defendant does not agree to a settlement made on his behalf, his or her dismissal from the lawsuit pur suant to that settlement will not be viewed as a favorable termination as long as it was a necessary condition to settlement\u201d); Haight, 244 Cal.Rptr. at 490 (<HOLDING>). This rule comports with Hawaii\u2019s public holding that plaintiffs were entitled to vacate final order of dismissal as void when they did not receive the motion for dismissal or notice of the hearing on the order until after the dismissal was enteredholding that a dismissal in the interest of justice can be a favorable termination under certain circumstancesholding that a dismissal of a defendant who did not agree to settlement is not a favorable termination if dismissal of that defendant was a condition of settlementholding that a settlement agreement is not a court order and therefore a violation of the settlement agreement would not subject a party to contemptholding that plaintiffs dismissal of personal injury action and subsequent dismissal of declaratory judgment action concerning extent of tortfeasors insurance coverage did not trigger double dismissal rule & \n\nhappened,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f a plaintiff alleges multiple discriminatory acts, each individual act ordinarily triggers a new clock for filing charges alleging that act\u201d (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)), adopted by 2012 WL 4364492 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2012), affd, 549 Fed.Appx. 15 (2d Cir.2013); Everett v. 357 Corp., 453 Mass. 585, 904 N.E.2d 733, 751 (2009) (finding that a claim for refusal to rehire an employee two years after termination constituted an independent claim that accrued when the request was denied, and noting that \u201cthe failure to rehire an employee is considered a discrete, separate act that does not draw other allegedly discriminatory acts into its scope\u201d); cf. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (<HOLDING>). Second, it is unclear when the statute of holding that in the first amendment employment context harassing speech must constitute constructive adverse employment action to be actionableholding that a proposed termination is the very type of discrete act identified as separate actionable unlawful employment practicesholding in the context of a title yii claim that discrete acts such as termination or refusals to hire are separate retaliatory adverse employment decisions that each constitutes a separate actionable unlawful employment practice holding that termination is an adverse employment actionholding that each incident of discrimination and each retaliatory adverse employment decision constitutes a separate actionable unlawful employment practice for which an administrative charge must be filed & \n\na reasonable foundation upon which to make the offer, a finding which must be made by the trial court after conducting an evidentiary hearing thereon). Ormond Beach also claims that the trial court erred in denying its request for statutory offer of judgment attorney\u2019s fees because its offer of judgment and amended offer of judgment \u201cundeniably satisfied the requirements of section 768.79\u201d. Ormond Beach argues that since it satisfied the procedural requirements of section 768.79 of the Florida Statute, the court trial erred in denying its request for fees. We disagree. Our supreme court has ruled that, upon voluntary dismissal of an action without prejudice, statutory offer of judgment attorney\u2019s fees are not recoverable. See MX Investments, Inc., v. Crawford, 700 So.2d 640 (Fla.1997)(<HOLDING>). Thus, once the trial court recognized holding proper basis for award of feesholding attorney fees not allowable as costsholding a summary judgment to be final although motion to assess attorney fees remained pending because award of attorney fees is collateral to judgmentholding that offer of judgment statute does not provide a basis for an award of attorney fees and costs unless dismissal is with prejudicerecognizing that an award of temporary attorneys fees and costs is based on an assessment of need and ability to pay as well as the reasonableness of the fees and costs & \n\nrelief from judgment pursuant to rule 1.540(b)(1), (2), or (3). In support of its argument that the foreclosure judgment is void, Sterling cites Shields v. Flinn, 528 So.2d 967 (Fla. 3d DCA 1988). In Shields, the Third District declared a judgment void two years after the entry of the judgment because the defendant, over whom the court had personal jurisdiction, had been given no notice of the trial date and had not appeared for the trial. Id.; see also Hammett v. Hammett, 510 So.2d 632 (Fla. 3d DCA 1987) (concluding in a one-paragraph opinion that a party\u2019s failure to receive notice of hearing at which the judgment was entered entitled that party to relief from the judgment pursuant to rule 1.540(b)(4)); Falkner v. Amerifirst Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n, 489 So.2d 758 (Fla. 3d DCA 1986) (<HOLDING>). These Third District cases, however, predate holding that dismissal with leave to amend is not a final orderholding that plaintiffs dismissal of personal injury action and subsequent dismissal of declaratory judgment action concerning extent of tortfeasors insurance coverage did not trigger double dismissal ruleholding that a plaintiffs voluntary dismissal of his claims with prejudice constituted a final order that was appealableholding dismissal for failure to comply with rule 8 was dismissal of entire action which was appealable final orderholding that plaintiffs were entitled to vacate final order of dismissal as void when they did not receive the motion for dismissal or notice of the hearing on the order until after the dismissal was entered & \n\non the basis of sex is the sine qua non of a Title IX sexual harassment case.\u201d Id. In the context of a Title IX sexual-harassment claim, \u201cthe plaintiff \u2018must always' prove that the conduct at issue was not merely tinged with offensive sexual connotations,\u2019 but in fact constituted discrimination \u2018because ... of sex.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81, 118 S.Ct. 998, 140 L.Ed.2d 201 (1998)); see, e.g., id. at 67 (affirming dismissal of Title IX claim \u201c[i]n the absence of conduct cre 1st Cir.2002) (affirming jury finding of sexually hostile work environment where female plaintiff was subject to \u201chumiliating sexual remarks and innuendos\u201d on a daily basis for over a year);, Winsor v. Hinckley Dodge, Inc., 79 F.3d 996, 1000 (10th Cir. 1996) (<HOLDING>); Andrews v. City of Phila., 895 F.2d 1469, holding that the plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence to establish constructive notice because the plaintiff did not present any evidence to establish that the oil was on the floor for any length of timeholding that male coworkers conduct in inter alia repeatedly calk ing plaintiff a whore slut bitch and cunt over the course of months could constitute sexual harassmentholding that evidence that male employees consistently called plaintiff whore floor whore curb whole curb side cunt and bitch a male employee pushed plaintiff against a wall and placed his knee between her legs and other men made comments to plaintiff that a woman had no place in a car dealership was sufficient to establish sexual harassmentholding that there was substantial similarity between plaintiff and her male predecessors jobholding that the plaintiff had a right of privacy in the contents of a settlement agreement that stated that the plaintiff had sued his employer for failing to hire him because he was a single gay male and because his employer suspected that he had aids & \n\n672 (10th Cir. 1999). If it were otherwise, a party could just attach all of his evidence to a motion for dismissal and thereby vitiate the critical distinction between dismissal proceedings, which are supposed to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint, and summary judgment proceedings, which properly encompass opposing evidence. As for substance, defendant\u2019s affidavit, indicating that the treatment recommended in 2007 was no longer appropriate in October 2008, does not demonstrate a difference of opinion as to the initial recommendation. And, of course, as Mr. Arocho has consistently claimed, the failure to treat his disease for such an interval itself may give rise to cognizable harm. See generally Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 92, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) holding potential damage to reputation to constitute irreparable harmholding that temporaryinjunction orders simple recitation of conclusory statement that plaintiff will suffer an irreparable injury for which it has no other adequate legal remedy does not satisfy rule 683s requirement that a temporary injunction order specify reasons why plaintiff will suffer irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at lawholding that a movant for a preliminary injunction must first demonstrate that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of the requested reliefrecognizing sufficiency of claim that prisoner will suffer irreparable damage if his hepatitis c disease goes untreatedholding the district courts of appeal have the ability to review a pretrial evidentiary order where the state would suffer irreparable harm if the order were not reviewed & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N. LaSalle, 190 B.R. at 585 (noting \u201cthe lack of any clear standard for determining the fairness of a discrimination in the treatment of classes under a chapter 11 plan\u201d and that \u201cthe limits of fairness in this context have not been established\u201d). Rather, courts may examine the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine whether unfair discrimination exists. See In re Johns-Manville Corp., 68 B.R. 618, 636 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1986) (\u201cThe language and legislative history of the statute provides little guidance in applying the \u2018unfair discrimination\u2019 standard.\u201d); see, e.g., In re Freymiller Trucking, Inc., 190 B.R. 913, 916 (Bankr.W.D.Okla.1996) (<HOLDING>); In re Aztec Co., 107 B.R. 585, 589 holding that a determination of unfair discrimination requires a court to consider all aspects of the case and the totality of all the circumstancesholding that an adverse credibility determination under the real id act must take into account the totality of the circumstances and all relevant factorsholding the right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstancesholding reasonable suspicion is based on totality of circumstancesholding that to determine whether a statement was voluntary the court must consider the totality of all the surrounding circumstances both the characteristics of the accused and the details of the interrogation and decide whether a defendants will was overborne by the circumstances surrounding the giving of a confession & \n\ndefendant, plaintiff has failed to establish that he filed a refund claim for the second quarter of 1988, as required before filing a suit for refund.

The Complaint here fails to state a cause of action. Although attorney honesty and fidelity are vital to the legal system and a matter in the public interest, we do not believe that a former law firm employee can be immune from the general rule of at-will employment merely by complaining to the Firm and its attorneys prior to being fired about deceitful but seemingly legal billing practices he no longer wishes to participate in. While we do not condone the Firm\u2019s alleged misconduct here, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs allegation of \u201chonesty and fidelity\u201d in the legal system satisfies the supreme court\u2019s \u201cnarrow definition of public policy\u201d in retaliatory discharge cases. Id. at 507-08 (<HOLDING>).

Local Law Claims Lastly, Defendants request that the court decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims if the federal law claims are dismissed. Plaintiff asserts several causes of action under the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Specifically, she alleges claims under Puerto Rico Laws 17, 69,100 and 80. With the dismissal of federal claims against Defendant, there are no pending claims giving rise to federal jurisdiction. 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1819(b)(2)(A). As such, dismissal of pending state law claims is proper because an independent jurisdictional basis is lacking. Exercising jurisdiction over pendent state law claims once the federal law claims are no longer present in the lawsuit is discretionary. See Newman v. Burgin, 930 F.2d 955, 963 (1st Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). In the instant case, the court chooses not to holding that the power of a federal court to hear and to determine statelaw claims in nondiversity cases depends upon the presence of at least one substantial federal claim in the lawsuitholding that the power of a federal court to hear and to determine statelaw claims in nondiversity cases depends upon the presence of at least one substantial federal claim in the lawsuit and the district court has considerable authority whether or not to exercise this power in light of such considerations as judicial economy convenience fairness to litigants and eomity holding if the legislature had the power to confer upon the county commissioners jurisdiction to hear and determine the question as to whether or not a town was of undue extent and to deprive it of a part of its territory then the proceeding being statutory before a body of limited powers the record must show affirmatively that such a case was brought before them as they were authorized to hear and determine and that all the jurisdictional facts were found to exist where the jurisdiction and power to hear and determine depends upon the existence of a fact that fact must appear or the proceedings are coram non judice and voidholding that in the interest of judicial economy we exercise our discretionary power to suspend the rules pertaining to interlocutory appeals and address the remainder of the defendants appealrecognizing a distinction between the power of a federal court to hear statelaw claims and the discretionary exercise of that power & \n\nit be argued that the timeliness of appellants' bad faith claim depended upon our Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that Miller was a permissive user of Madalyn Gower\u2019s vehicle, which ruling required appellee to pay the policy limits. A bad faith action under section 8371 is neither related to nor dependent on the underlying contract claim against the insurer. See March v. Paradise Mutual Insurance Co., 435 Pa.Super. 597, 646 A.2d 1254 (1994) (\u201ca claim brought under section 8371 is a cause of action which is separate and distinct from the underlying contract claim.\u201d). As a result, Miller (and, by extension, appellants) were not required to wait until the merits of the contract claim were decided to file suit for bad faith. See Boring v. Erie Insurance Group, 434 Pa.Super. 40, 641 A.2d 1189 (1984) (<HOLDING>); and Margolies v. State Farm Fire & Casualty holding dismissal for failure to comply with rule 8 was dismissal of entire action which was appealable final orderholding arbitration decision disallowing insurers coverage defense binding in subsequent personal injury action where the issue was actually litigated and decided in prior actionholding that although the issue of coverage had not yet been decided appellants action under 8371 was a separate claim and the dismissal of that claim was instantly appealableholding voluntary dismissal permissible because trial court had not yet reached a decision on the meritsholding that plaintiffs dismissal of personal injury action and subsequent dismissal of declaratory judgment action concerning extent of tortfeasors insurance coverage did not trigger double dismissal rule & \n\nineffective assistance under Strickland [v.

Ficco, 438 F.3d 35, 49 (1st Cir.2006). In this case, it is clear that the error complained of \u2014 Goldman\u2019s sentencing as a Career Offender despite the invalidity of one of his essential prior convictions \u2014 had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d The government does not dispute that Goldman\u2019s Career Offender status increased his sentence by at least seventeen years. This constitutes a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d and meets the Strickland standard. See Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. 198, 203, 121 S.Ct. 696, 148 L.Ed.2d 604 (2001) (<HOLDING>). With regard to cause, Goldman argues that the holding that it is error to engraft onto the prejudice branch of the strickland test a requirement that any increase in a sentence must meet a standard of significanceholding regarding sixth amendment prejudice if there is no reasonable possibility that the appellate court would have ruled in his favor there can be no strickland prejudiceholding that there is no baseline or quantifiable increase in a defendants sentence that must be shown to establish prejudice under stricklandholding that any reduction in sentence constitutes substantial prejudice for purposes of strickland analysisholding that prejudice is shown where a sentencing error may affect the determination of sentence & \n\nassumption is in error. On April 30, 1993, the court dismissed all the charges against Woodland without prejudice. In October of 1993, new charges were filed. During the approximately seven months separating the dismissal and the reinstatement of charges, Woodland was confined in a mental institution. This period of confinement involved no formal charges. Woodland was not held because he was an alleged criminal but because his mental health at the time warranted such confinement. This period should not be used to calculate a speedy trial violation. See Trafny, 799 P.2d at 706 (stating that time spent holding defendant on separate parole violation following formal dismissal of charges cannot be attributable to state); see also Johnson v. United States, 333 F.2d 371, 374 (10th Cir.1964) (<HOLDING>). The State filed new charges against Woodland holding that the constitutional right to a speedy trial includes the right to a reasonably prompt sentencingholding that the dismissal of an indictment before trial and institution of a superseding indictment does not trigger double jeopardyholding that ajppellant can not complain of the denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial because of his confinement in a state mental institution after dismissal of the former indictmentholding that a 19month delay between indictment and trial did not violate the constitutional right to a speedy trialholding that trial courts limited findings were insufficient to allow determination of whether trial court abused its discretion in denying defendants motion to dismiss his indictment on constitutional speedy trial grounds & \n\ndo so.\u201d). Further, it is well-settled that \u201c[a] party is bound by, and a court is powerless to rewrite, the clear and unambiguous terms of a voluntary contract.\u201d Brooks v. Green, 993 So.2d 58, 61 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008). This principle applies even where the terms of the contract are \u201charsh\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d Id. at 61. (citations omitted). In addition, to give proper meaning to a specific contract provision, a court must consider it in the context of the entire contract. Hand, 983 So.2d at 687. When an employment agreement contains a noncompete covenant, the restriction survives the termination of the agreement if the agreement contains express language demonstrating that the parties intended its survival. Brenner v. Barco Chems. Div., Inc., 209 So.2d 277, 278 (Fla. 3d DCA 1968) (<HOLDING>).

Under the Compact, an EIS needs to include holding that an eis must consider the extent to which adverse effects can be avoided by discussing possible mitigation measuresrecognizing that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense a party must plead and proveholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleadedholding that an adverse credibility determination must be supported by a true inconsistencyholding that perfunctory description of mitigation measures was inadequate & \n\ninsufficient to justify reversal.\u201d Fritz, supra, 105 N.J. at 44, 519 A.2d 336. Only after evaluating the specific claims asserted at the PCR hearing may we determine whether counsel\u2019s failure to introduce mitigating evidence prejudiced defendant. Although the lack of sufficient time to prepare for trial can support an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, a defendant generally may support that claim with proof of specific evidence adduced at a post-conviction hearing, but not at the original trial. See Glenn v. Tate, 71 F.3d 1204, 1207 (6th Cir.1995) (finding prejudice in sentencing proceedings where counsel failed to present pertinent evidence of mental history and mental capacity discovered at post-sentencing hearing); Blanco v. Singletary, 943 F.2d 1477, 1501-02 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); State v. Tokman, 564 So.2d 1339, 1345 holding that mayfield was prejudiced by his defense counsels failure to present all the available mitigating evidence although the aggravating evidence against mayfield was strong and the mitigation evidence presented was substantialholding trial counsels failure to investigate and present substantial mitigation evidence during the sentencing phase can constitute ineffective assistance of counselholding that mental health evidence could be mitigating at the penalty phase even though it is insufficient to establish a legal defense to conviction in the guilty phaseholding that defendant was prejudiced at sentencing phase by counsels failure to discover and present any available mitigating evidence concerning defendants impoverished childhood epileptic seizures and organic brain damageholding that any relevant mitigating evidence concerning a defendants character should not be excluded & \n\nhis federal capital trial, confronts the prospect of losing his key mitigation witness as a result. The government contends the defendant is not entitled to an expert of his choosing. That argument is unassailable. See, e.g., Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68, 83, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985) (\u201cThis is not to say, of course, that the indigent defendant has a constitutional right to choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or to receive funds to hire his own. Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the purpose we have discussed....\u201d); Walton v. Angelone, 321 F.3d 442, 464 (4th Cir.2003) (\u201cWalton had no constitutional right to insist on the appointment of any particular expert.\u201d); Wilson v. Greene, 155 F.3d 396, 401-02 (4th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). The defendant does not contend otherwise. holding that the constitution does not entitle a criminal defendant to the effective assistance of an expert witnessholding the sixth amendment right to effective assistance extends to a criminal defendants first appeal as of rightholding that witness immunity does not bar a claim against a retained expert witness for negligence performance of his dutyrecognizing that a criminal defendants right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counselholding a criminal defendant has the right to effective assistance of counsel during a plea process & \n\nadjudication. The Puerto Rico high court has at least discussed, and has seemingly signaled, the existence of an inverse condemnation remedy.... We think [that the appellants] must pursue that remedy before they can maintain a federal damages claim.... Id. at 514-15. So it is here. If the plaintiff were to pursue the inverse condemnation remedy, the local courts would be presented with an issue of first impression under Puerto Rico law. Until he travels that road, the availability vel non of the inverse condemnation remedy remains open to question. It is the claimant\u2019s burden to prove that the potential state remedy is unavailable, and uncertainty prevents him from carrying that burden. Consequently, his section 1983 takings claims are unripe. See Gilbert, 932 F.2d at 64-65 (<HOLDING>). The plaintiffs second argument focuses on the holding that plaintiff had failed to state a claim for relief under section 1983holding that due process is not violated when a state employee intentionally deprives an individual of property or liberty so long as the state provides a meaningful postdeprivation remedy such as an article 78 proceedingholding that as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority a court should not vacate his decisionholding as long as the defendant has an adequate opportunity to impeach the reliability of a scientific test and the qualifications of the person administering the test due process is not implicated by a states good faith failure to preserve a sample for independent testingholding that as long as the state provides an arguably adequate process for securing compensation for a taking federal intervention un der section 1983 before the claimant has resorted to that procedure is premature & \n\nadverse discrimination at all. The whole purpose of Title VII, as stated clearly by its text and controlling case law, is preventing harmful discrimination, not the lamentable-but-benign discrimination that the jury found Litton experienced. I respectfully dissent. 1 . See, e.g., Moore v. Freeman, 355 F.3d 558, 562 (6th Cir.2004); Cline v. Catholic Diocese of Toledo, 206 F.3d 651, 661 (6th Cir.2000); Riser v.

Gretillat\u2019s admitted ability to compensate for her limitations weighs against a finding that she is disabled under the ADA.

Gen.Stat. \u00a7 10-76L The plaintiff has not alleged that either of these appeals were procedurally defective. The court therefore concludes that the defendants afforded the plaintiff all the process that was due to him under the Due Process Clause. See Wenger v. Canastota Cent. Sch.

In support of its position, KCC relies on the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in Williams that a twenty-five pound lifting restriction could not, as a matter of law, substantially limit the major life activity of working. Williams, 101 F.3d at 349. However, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision on this issue conflicts with the ADA\u2019s directives that the determination whe .3d at 349; Dutcher v.

The Supreme Court has, however, questioned in dicta whether \"working\u201d should be considered a major life activity under the ADA. See Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999) (<HOLDING>). In Sutton, the Court entertained on the holding that disability determinations must be made with reference to corrective measuresholding that an employers awareness of an employees impairment without more is insufficient to demonstrate that the employer regarded the employee as disabledholding that the determination of whether an individual is disabled should be made with reference to measures that miti gate the individuals impairment including in this instance eyeglasses and contact lensesholding that the determination of whether an individual is an independent contractor lies in the common law and not under an express provision of the actholding that monocular vision is not invariably a disability but should be analyzed on an individual basis taking into account the individuals ability to compensate for the impairment & \n\nof such an available remedy, this case will be heard in federal courts rather than state courts whether or not this Court concludes that the complaint constitutes a challenge to processes of state and local taxation.' Ah appropriate regard for the delicate balance between state and national judicial authority counsels that, insofar as feasible, decisions relating to the jurisdiction and remedial capacity of the Delaware state courts \u2014 decisions central to the resolution of this case \u2014 be made by the Delaware courts themselves. (c) Our concern about the remedy available in the Delaware courts arises in part from the potential tension between the decision of the Court of Chancery in Delaware Bankers Ass\u2019n v.

INS, 332 F.3d 1245, 1252 (9th Cir.2003), the government\u2019s argument fundamentally misunderstands the nature of our review. Whatever the grounds on which Al Mutarreb might have been found removable, only one was charged. We have no power to affirm the BIA on a ground never charged by the Service or found by the IJ. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196, 67 S.Ct. 1575, 91 L.Ed. 1995 (1947) (noting that a \u201ccourt is powerless to affirm the administrative action by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate and proper basis\u201d not relied on by the agency); see also Cardoso-Tlaseca v. Gonzales, 460 F.3d 1102, 1107 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Nor do we accept the government\u2019s contention holding that when an ij issues a decision granting an aliens application for withholding of removal without a grant of asylum the decision must include an explicit order of removal designating a country of removalholding proof of possession of stolen goods is sufficient evidence to sustain conviction for theftholding that term order of removal does not include aliens ineffective assistance of counsel claim concerning attorneys actions taken after order of removal becomes finalholding that the defendants prior drug conviction for simple possession did not constitute a controlled substance offense because the plain language of 4b12b requires that the prior conviction involve possession with intent to distributeholding that an aliens prior possession conviction cannot sustain the removal order because it was not alleged in the nta & \n\nmatter illustrates the impossibility of an adequate appellate review. During voir dire, the State inquired whether any of the prospective jurors or members of their families had experienced drug addiction problems, and it appears from the transcript that several answered affirmatively. Unfortunately, they are not identified by name or juror number. This is critical because Mr. McKenzie alleged that the State improperly exercised a peremptory challenge on the sole African-American member of the jury panel. The gist of Mr. McKenzie\u2019s argument was that the reason advanced by the State to sustain its challenge, although appearing race neutral, was pretextual. See Melbourne v. State, 679 So.2d 759 (Fla.1996). The Assistant State Attorney expressed concern that the juror seemed d 1994) (<HOLDING>).

Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 118, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) which holds that a complaint alleging a hostile work environment will not be time barred if all acts constituting the claim are part of the same unlawful practice and at least one act falls within the filing period. See Vega v. Hernandez, 381 F.Supp.2d 31, 38 (D.Puerto Rico 2005). A public employer who fails to make an adequate investigation of an employee\u2019s sexual harassment complaint can be held liable under Title VII for hostile work environment created by another of its employees under negligence theory, without regard to effectiveness of employer\u2019s remedial action. See O\u2019Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713 (1st Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico claims holding that physician was an independent contractor and thus could not sue hospital under title vii of the civil rights act of 1964holding there is no private right of action to enforce disparateimpact regulations brought under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 in part because of the enforcement scheme congress provided in that statuteholding that congress intended for idea to be interpreted consistent with fee provisions of statutes such as title vii of the civil rights act of 1964holding liability for claims under civil rights act of 1964 and remedial administrative procedures which emphasized going through channels providing no mechanism to female firefighter for airing grievances involving conduct of superiors who were in chain of commandholding that title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 provides the exclusive remedy for claims of employment discrimination by federal agencies & \n\na petition for review which challenges a removal order to limit its review to the facts in the administrative record, the court of appeals will not be in a proper position to rule on a \u201cconstitutionally based injunction on the execution of a removal order.\u201d Id. In the absence of habeas jurisdiction in the district courts, Petitioner fears that she will be deprived of an adequate and effective forum for judicial review. In such a situation, Petitioner argues, \u00a7 106 of the REAL ID Act constitutes an unlawful suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Id. In order to avoid a Suspension Clause violation, Petitioner argues that this court should interpret \u00a7 106 so that her case is not transferred to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. See St. Cyr., 533 U.S. at 299-300, 121 S.Ct. 2271 (<HOLDING>) (internal quotations and citations omitted). holding that the rule of strict construction does not require the court to assign the narrowest possible interpretation to the statuteholding that if an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute would raise serious constitutional problems and where an alternative interpretation of the statute is fairly possible we are obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problemsholding that when a court is asked to construe an ambiguous statute it must defer to the interpretation set out in a regulation promulgated by the agency charged with administering the statute so long as the agencys interpretation is reasonableholding that we are to apply the legislative intent underlying a statute and to construe the statute in such a way as to prevent absurdityholding that the statute qualifies as an exemption 3 statute & \n\nfor an employer\u2019s liability. An employer is directly liable for hostile environment sexual harassment if it knew, or upon reasonably diligent inquiry should have known, of the harassment and failed to take immediate and appropriate corrective action. See Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.1989); Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 (11th Cir.1982). Under this theory of direct liability, the City can be held liable for its own negligence or recklessness, but not for the conduct of its supervisors or employees. In contrast, an employer is indirectly, or vicariously, liable for the wrongful conduct of its agent, whether or not the employer knew or should have known about the agent\u2019s 6-07 (4th Cir.1989), vacated in part, 900 F.2d 27 (4th Cir.1990)(<HOLDING>); Hicks v.

Hopkins, 176 Ariz. at 177, 859 P.2d at 800 (citing Goodyear Aircraft Corp. v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 62 Ariz. 398, 402-03, 158 P.2d 511, 513 (1945)). In fact, where doubt exists as to the proper construction, courts in workers\u2019 compensation eases should adopt the construction that will best effectuate the purpose of compensating the claimant for his disability. Id. (citing Bonnin v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 6 Ariz.App. 317, 320, 432 P.2d 283, 286 (1967)); see also Aitken v. Indus. Comm\u2019n, 183 Ariz. 387, 392, 904 P.2d 456, 461 (1995) (<HOLDING>). Consequently, in workers\u2019 compensation cases, recognizing that the waiver rule is procedural not jurisdictional and we may suspend it in our discretion citations omittedholding that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed in the employees favor and any doubt in its construction is thus resolved in favor of the employeeholding that where the existence of one or more of the essential elements of standing depends on the unfettered choices made by independent actors not before the courts and whose exercise of broad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume either to control or to predict it becomes the burden of the plaintiff to adduce facts showing that those choices have been or will be made in such manner as to produce causation and permit redressability of injury internal quotation marks and citations omittedrecognizing that we have consistently applied workers compensation laws liberally remedially and in a manner insuring that injured employees receive maximum available benefits and the overriding theme of the system as evidenced by our constitution statutes and case law has been to preserve a claimants opportunity to be made whole to the fullest possible extentnothing more or less citations omittedholding that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed and reasonable doubts as to construction are to be resolved in favor of coverage & \n\nintended for the Workers' Compensation Act to \"be interpreted so as to assure the quick and efficient delivery of disability and medical benefits to injured workers at a reasonable cost to employers, without the necessity of any litigation ....\" \u00a7 8-40-102, C.R.S. (2007). Thus, a primary purpose of the Workers' Compensation Act is to compensate injured workers \"regardless of fault.\" Colo. Springs Disposal v. Indus. Claim Appeals Office, 58 P.3d 1061, 1063 (Colo.App.2002). In a previous case, we noted that the Workers' Compensation Act \"is intended to be remedial and beneficial in purpose, and should be liberally construed in order to accomplish these goals.\" Davison, 84 P.3d at 1029 (internal quotation marks omitted). The temporary total disability benefits 29-30 (Colo.App.1983) (<HOLDING>). The penalties and enforcement provision holding a claimant who refuses to provide financial information necessary to ascertain whether a claimant is working may have his indemnity benefits suspended until such information is providedholding that a claimants benefits were rightly suspended under what is now section 8434048 when the claimant refused to cooperate with a vocational rehabilitation planholding that a claimant establishes a prima facie case for compensable medical treatment where a qualified physician indicates treatment was necessary for a workrelated conditionholding that a claimants benefits were rightly suspended under what is now section 8434043 when the claimant did not return to the authorized physician for treatmentholding the procedural right to request a onetime change of physician during the course of treatment does not attach until claimant actually begins treatment with the initially authorized physician & \n\nrequires Educators to bargain directly with Savage. This statutory provision, together with the structurally inclusive nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, creates a relationship of trust and reliance between injured employees and workers\u2019 compensation insurers. I would hold, as have several other courts, that this relationship places a tort-based duty on insurers to deal in good faith with injured employees. See Savio, 706 P.2d at 1272-74 (nature of workers\u2019 compensation insurance, combined with section of workers\u2019 compensation statute requiring that insurance policies contain clause making insurer primarily liable to employee, creates tort duty on part of insurer to deal in good faith with employee); see also Case v.

See 7 P.S. \u00a7 6217.l.D. The Department and the amici reason that lenders would have no incentive to obtain a license in order to charge higher interest rates, because they could capture that increase by charging high fees, thus rendering the statute useless at protecting the public against usury. 9 . Moreover, this Court has recognized that choice-of-law agreements can be avoided when the terms offend Commonwealth public policy even in disputes between contracting parties. See McIlvaine Trucking, Inc. v. W.C.A.B. (States), 570 Pa. 662, 672-73, 810 A.2d 1280, 1286 (2002) (<HOLDING>). Pennsylvania courts have consistently held holding that the trial courts authority to initiate workers compensation benefits before the final adjudication was not divested by the legislature and was consistent with the stated purpose of the workers compensation actholding that legislature clearly intended that workers compensation act and unemployment security act be construed together thus prohibiting worker from receiving both unemployment compensation and workers compensation payments for same periodholding that the parties choiceoflaw agreement as relating to workers compensation was appropriately avoided where it offended state public policy as reflected in express provisions of the pennsylvania workers compensation actholding that the provisions of the workers compensation act must be satisfied or the action is not maintainable in the courtsholding that provisions of section 40115102 are applicable to the determination of the status of truck drivers as employees or independent contractors under the workers compensation act and discussing legislative history indicating intent to apply these provisions both to workers compensation and unemployment compensation matters & \n\nWhile we agree that the definition of employer requires that the entity \u201cemployf] workers under the terms of the W orkers\u2019 Compensation Act,\u201d we disagree that the language requires that all counted workers actually be eligible for workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. Section 52-1-15. {9} There are several instances in which a worker is counted to determine whether an employer is subject to the Act but is not ultimately covered under the Act\u2019s provisions. See, e.g., Howie v. Stevens, 102 N.M. 300, 302, 694 P.2d 1365, 1367 (Ct. App. 1984) (recognizing that an illegally employed minor would presumably be counted to determine application of the Act to the employer but has the right to circumvent the Act\u2019s coverage and pursue remedies in tort), Garcia, 111 N.M. at 211, 803 P.2d at 1116 (<HOLDING>). But the most important example is contained recognizing retaliatory discharge claim where employer prevented employees exercise of workers compensation rights because of employees intention to file claimholding that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed and reasonable doubts as to construction are to be resolved in favor of coverageholding that probation department employees are not county employeesholding that individual employees are not liable under title viiholding that past employees who were regularly employed are still to be counted to determine worker minimums even though those workers are now no longer employees and thus ineligible for coverage & \n\nof service, or disability not compensated under the workers\u2019 compensation law. The remaining subsections of \u00a7 48-628 outline other behaviors or scenarios 2d 804 (Del. Super. 1982); Stafford v. Welltech, 867 P.2d 484 (Okla. App. 1993). The rationale in the cases for permitting recovery under both acts is that the statutory language does not prohibit a dual recovery and is further based upon the beneficent objectives of both workers\u2019 compensation and employment security legislation. See Levi Strauss & Co., supra; Neuberger, supra; Mendez, supra; Stafford, supra. As noted by the defendants, other states deny or reduce unemployment benefits by the amount of workers\u2019 compensation the claimant receives or vice versa. See, e.g., Cuellar v. Northland Steel, 226 Mont. 428, 736 P.2d 130 (1987) (<HOLDING>); St. Pierre v. Fulflex, Inc., 493 A.2d 817 holding that in absence of statute prohibiting recovery claimant may receive workers compensation and unemployment benefits simultaneouslyholding that district court had discretion to decline to offset severance and unemployment payments from damages awardholding that legislature clearly intended that workers compensation act and unemployment security act be construed together thus prohibiting worker from receiving both unemployment compensation and workers compensation payments for same periodholding that pursuant to statute unemployment benefits must be offset against workers compensation paymentsholding that claimant may simultaneously receive unemployment benefits and workers compensation for temporary partial disability where statute only precludes receipt of workers compensation for temporary total or permanent total disability if claimant is receiving unemployment benefits & \n\nAct is to make compensation the exclusive remedy of the employee where he is injured by the employer or any of its employees during the course of his employment.\u201d). 11 .See Ala Code \u00a7 25-5-11.

For example, in Pro-Football, Inc. v. McCants, a player on the roster of the Washington NFL football team brought in Maryland a workers\u2019 compensation claim for game injuries sustained in various forums\u2014some in Maryland, and some out of state. 428 Md. 270, 275-76, 51 A.3d 586, 589-90 (2012). McCants\u2019 employment contract contained a forum-selection clause choosing Virginia law, but we allowed McCants nonetheless to maintain a claim in Maryland for the injuries sustained here and out-of-state. McCants, 428 Md. at 288, 51 A.3d at 596-97; see Pro-Football, Inc. v. Tupa, 197 Md.App. 463, 471, 474, 14 A.3d 678, 682, 684 (2011), aff'd, 428 Md. 198, 51 A.3d 544 (2012) (<HOLDING>). Although significant differences exist holding that employee must prove that the sole reason for their discharge was their filing of a workers compensation claim to prevail on a claim of wrongful discharge under marylands workers compensation actholding that when an employee suffers an injury from an unexplained fall while the employee is on the job and performing the duties of his employment that injury is eligible for compensation under the workers compensation actholding that because maryland law expressly creates right to file workers compensation claim action exists for wrongful discharge for termination based solely on the filing of a workers compensation claimholding that the trial courts authority to initiate workers compensation benefits before the final adjudication was not divested by the legislature and was consistent with the stated purpose of the workers compensation actholding that a player on the roster of the washington nfl football team was a covered employee under 9203a of the workers compensation statute despite working intermittently in maryland playing games at fedex field and primarily in virginia practicing & \n\nfor an alleged work-related injury through a Board-approved settlement. See OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15. The interplay of OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 34-9-11 (a) and 34-9-15 (b), which this Court has not previously addressed, is informed by how we and the Court of Appeals have interpreted the interplay between the exclusive remedy provision and subsection (a) of OCGA\u00a7 34-9-15. (b) It is well established that a settlement under OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15 (a) which requires an employer to compensate its employee for an alleged injury bars a subsequent tort suit by the employee against anyone protected by the exclusive remedy provision, regardless of the actual circumstances of the employee\u2019s injury and the amount of compensation to which the parties agreed. See Haygood v. Home Transp. Co., 244 Ga. 165, 166-167 (259 SE2d 429) (1979) (<HOLDING>); Thorn v. Phillips, 164 Ga. App. 47, 48 (296 holding that an administrative agency or a state courts finding that an employer had just cause to terminate a plaintiff is not preclusive with regard to the plaintiffs discrimination claim against the employerholding that glc 152 15 provides that the only party immune from suit under the statute is the direct employer a special employer is not immune because the special employer is not liable for the payment of workers compensation and there was no agreement between the direct employer and the special employer that the special employer would be liable for the payment of such compensationrecognizing that an appellants tort claim was barred by the doctrine of election of remedies where the appellant had previously pursued and recovered workers compensation benefits for the same injuryholding that an employer who commits an intentional tort against his employee cannot claim that the act was accidental so that workers compensation is the employees exclusive remedyholdingthat the exclusive remedy provision barred a tort lawsuit against the plaintiffs employer because the plaintiff had previously entered a boardapproved settlement with the employer for the same injury & \n\ncoverage of an existing one. Jaffee v. Redmond, 518 U.S. 1, 12-13, 116 S.Ct. 1923, 135 L.Ed.2d 337 (1996) (citing Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 48-50, 100 S.Ct. 906, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1980)). Faced with a dearth of federal precedent, blindly resorting to only the forum state\u2019s privilege law is inappropriate. Appellant has not shown that California law is in accord with most states, or that it is likely that the federal common law would be advanced by the injection of California\u2019s broadened view of the client-representative extension of attorney-client privilege. Fed.R.Evid. 501 (stating that federal courts should recognize evidentiary privileges according to the principles of the common law in the light of reason and experience); see also Trammel, 445 U.S. at 50, 100 S.Ct. 906 (<HOLDING>); Carman v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 114 F.3d holding that the burden rests upon the party seeking benefits to prove the injury sustained was the result of an accident arising out of and in the course of employment and the rule of liberal construction is not a substitute for the claimants burden of establishing his claim by a preponderance of the evidenceholding that the party asserting work product protection has the burden of establishing that the doctrine appliesholding that a party seeking a new privilege must overcome a significant burden of establishing that excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truthholding that a party seeking a writ bears the burden of proving that it has no other means of attaining the relief such as by appealholding that the party seeking to vacate the award has the burden of providing the court with the evidence to support its arguments & \n\n[the compensation claim], state the reason in detail.\u201d (Emphasis added). This question should have indicated to Rhodes that there is a separate government entity responsible for adjudicating disputes over compensation claims that arise between workers and their employing agencies. Thus, Rhodes reasonably should have understood that this entity, rather than her employing agency, would receive her completed form. Thus, the workers\u2019 compensation form itself put Rhodes on notice that it would be sent to the Department of Labor. Because Rhodes could not reasonably have expected that her form would be hand-carried to that agency, a reasonably jury could conclude that Rhodes should have known that her form would be sent by mail. See United States v. Fore, 169 F.3d 104, 109 (2d Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). III. We turn finally to Rhodes\u2019 contention holding that notice and a hearing were required before the commissioner of insurance could require an insurance company to change its definition of at fault in order to secure approval of an increase in insurance ratesholding that defendant reasonably could have foreseen use of the mails because he had completed insurance forms that required verification from his doctor and the insurance company and his doctor did not share the same locationholding that under georgia law a holder of a master insurance policy is an agent of the insurance company and not the insurerholding that plaintiff could recover medical fees not actually paid by the insurance company pursuant to an insurance contractholding that even if an insurance broker is the agent of the insurance company for purposes of soliciting and procuring the policy that would not necessarily make the broker the agent of the insurance company for the purpose of receiving notice of suits and claims & \n\nIn addition, to the extent Olmstead has argued that the court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because he was proceeding without counsel, a defendant\u2019s pro se status in civil litigation generally will not excuse mistakes he makes regarding procedural mies. See McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (explaining that the Court \u201cnever [had] suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel,\u201d because \u201cexperience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legislature is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law\u201d); see also Wayne v. Jarvis, 197 F.3d 1098, 1104 (11th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, relief cannot be granted under Rule holding that a pro se litigants failure to comply with the filing deadlines for a notice of appeal set out in federal rule of bankruptcy procedure 8002 meant that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the litigants appealholding that although pro se litigants are entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings pro se litigants must follow procedural rulesrecognizing that although pro se litigants are not entitled to greater rights than represented litigants due process principles permit the imposition of a procedural bar only after consideration of the pro se litigants reasonable expectations about what had occurredholding that rule 56f applies to pro se litigantsholding that liberal construction of the pleading requirements for pro se litigants does not equate with liberal deadlines & \n\nKentucky Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, KRS 342.690(1) provides: If an employer secures payment of compensation as required by this chapter, the liability of such employer under this chapter shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death. KRS 342.690(1) (emphasis added). The statute and Kentucky case law interpreting the statute make it clear that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy where a covered employee is injured by her employer\u2019s negligent actions. See, e.g., Shamrock Coal Co., Inc. v. Maricle, 5 S.W.3d 130 (Ky.1999) (<HOLDING>); Hardin v. Action Graphics, Inc., 57 S.W.3d holding that the exclusivity of workers compensation is an affirmative statutory defense which must be timely raised or it is waivedholding that coal workers claim that mine owner was negligent careless and reckless in its mining operations was barred under exclusivity provision of workers compensation actholding that exclusivity provision of workers compensation act barred wifes loss of consortium claimholding that an injured workers initial election to seek state compensation does not implicate the exclusivity provision to preclude the worker from later seeking compensation under the longshore actholding that the coemployee immunity provision in workers compensation law was constitutional & \n\nplaintiff filed the motion to remand presently before the court. Plaintiff contends that this suit \u201carises under\u201d Alabama\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws and, as a result, its removal to federal court is barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c). DISCUSSION Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445(c), \u201c[a] civil action in any State court arising under the workmen\u2019s compensation laws of such State may not be removed to any district court of the United States.\u201d The issue before the court is whether a claim for retaliation for the exercise of rights under Alabama\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation laws \u201carises under\u201d those laws, precluding its removal to federal court. A number of courts have considered this question and the decisions go both ways. See, e.g., Humphrey v. Sequentia, Inc., 58 F.3d 1238, 1246 (8th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); Spearman v.

The obvious purpose of the present action, indeed of the FTC Act itself, is protection of the public welfare and the effectuation of public policy respecting the credit counseling industry. Regardless of whether private rights of consumers may be adjudicated in some fashion, in this proceeding the FTC is operating on behalf of the public interest, not as a creditor seeking to assert its own pecuniary interest. See id. (<HOLDING>) Assuming the liability of Defendants is holding that courts must distinguish between situations in which the state acts pursuant to its police power and situations in which the state acts merely to protect its status as a creditorholding that the missouri constitution reserves the power of referendum only to acts of the state legislative assembly and not to acts of a municipalityholding that courts must accommodate the contracts clause with the inherent police power of the state to safeguard the vital interests of its peopleholding that a public corporation in that case a commission created to provide information about the tva is an entity separate from the state and its acts are not acts of the state within the meaning of the state constitutions prohibition against the state creating new debtsholding as to the admissibility of prior bad acts that allegedly took place fourteen and twelve years before the acts alleged in that case that the lapse of time between the defendants sexual acts goes to the weight of the evidence not to its admissibility & \n\nbars relitigation of an issue if: (1) the issue sought to be p ration of orders to provide installments of a fixed amount, rendering the party's overall exposure a direct consequence of the order's duration. See, eg., Ferris v.

Although the incentive to vigorously defend might be artificially created by the operation of collateral estoppel principles, augmenting a party's incentive to litigate in the first instance would undermine the very purpose behind permitting t ication of workers' compensation benefits. See\" Messina, 874 P.2d at 1066 n. 13 (<HOLDING>). Temporary total disability benefits are holding that legislature clearly intended that workers compensation act and unemployment security act be construed together thus prohibiting worker from receiving both unemployment compensation and workers compensation payments for same periodholding collateral estoppel elements met considering changed circumstances in the context of an exception to the general rule of collateral estoppelrecognizing the doctrine of collateral estoppel in agency proceedingsrecognizing that rationale underlying inapplicability of collateral estoppel to unemployment hearings is useful when analyzing same doctrine in workers compensation casesholding that pursuant to statute unemployment benefits must be offset against workers compensation payments & \n\nofficers may be removed before the end of their statutorily defined term.

Furthermore, reading section 581(b) as mandating a five-year term renders section 581(c) meaningless, a construction we will not adopt. See Food & Drug Admin, v.

Furthermore, as discussed above, because all states owe due process obligations to \u201cany person,\u201d without regard to state borders, if a neighboring state is later poised to close an abortion provider upon which a Mississippi woman relies, she could sue to enjoin that closure.

These distinctions in the two neighboring state\u2019s laws created differing expectations about what conduct each would allow or prohibit. This case is, thus, distinguishable from those in which courts declined to dismiss claims recognized under New Jersey local law, even though out-of-state plaintiffs might have been unable to pursue such causes of action under their own state\u2019s local law. In those matters, the plaintiffs were allowed to pursue their claims on the ground that their home states had no reason to deny them the fortuity of a remedy for what both states recognized as \u201cthe same evil,\u201d even if they did not recognize it to the same degree.

While federal courts often apply different state laws to federal claims, for example, the statute of limitations for a section 1983 claim differs depending on the state in which the claim arose, see Wilson v.

I reject the Commissioner\u2019s assertion that plaintiffs cannot raise their federal constituJ tional claims in federal court. This is an action seeking injunctive relief against the Commissioner in his official capacity. The longstanding doctrine of Ex Parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), squ act is a citizen of the state at issue at the time when the contract is entered, the state does not, for that reason alone, obtain jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes arising under the contract. See, e.g., Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 478-79, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85 L.Ed.2d 528 (1985) (<HOLDING>); Francosteel Corp. v.

See 516 U.S. 489, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). Although Varity interpreted \u00a7 1132(a)(3) to authorize individual suits, its holding is not as broad as Wilson contends. The Supreme Court ruled that an individual can sue under \u00a7 1132(a)(3), but he or she must: (1) only seek equitable relief, and (2) have no more specific means of relief available. See Varity, 516 U.S. at 508-15, 116 S.Ct. 1065; Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, 127 F.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1997). Wilson\u2019s claim seeks damages in the amount of the rehabilitation expenses, not injunctive relief. Furthermore, the remedy for a claim that a plan participant\u2019s benefits were improperly denied is specifically provided for in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). See Turner, 127 F.3d at 200 (<HOLDING>). Thus, even if Wilson amended Count V, he holding that an individual who brings a lawsuit pursuant to 1132a1b to challenge a denial of disability benefits does not also have a right to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty under 1132a3holding that 1132a1b affords the plaintiff adequate relief for her benefits claim and a cause of action under 1132a3 is thus not appropriateholding that action to recover erisa benefits under the subject plan are legal in nature and that plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to trial by jury on any claim raised under 1132a1bholding plaintiff had no claim under 1132a3 because his grievance that benefits were denied is specifically addressed in 1132a1bholding that no ada violation was shown because the disabled were not denied benefits that were otherwise available & \n\nv.

In contrast, parties who sue as shareholders, with no independent stake in the outcome other than through their ownership interest in the corporation, are not in privity of contract and have no basis to allege injury for breach. See Glass v.

Mem. at 26). Individual issues, however, would predominate even before the damages stage. Because plaintiff will not be able to prove class-wide, company-wide discrimination with statistical evidence alone, a jury would need to consider each putative class member\u2019s claim individually to determine liability. To prove that an individual plaintiff suffered gender discrimination under disparate impact or disparate treatment theories of Title VII or the Equal Pay Act, an individualized inquiry into each putative plaintiffs circumstances would be necessary to determine whether employment actions taken toward a particular employee were based on gender or instead on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. See Warren v. Solo Cup Co., 516 F.3d 627, 629-30 (7th Cir., 2008) (<HOLDING>); Atanus v. Perry, 520 F.3d 662, 672-73 (7th holding that same standard applies to equal pay act and title vii wage discrimination claimsholding that if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of wage discrimination under the equal pay act the employer may raise one of four statutory defenses attributing the difference in pay to i a seniority system ii a merit system ni a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production or iv a differential based on any other factor other than sexholding that if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of age discrimination the employer must show that the discharge was based on reasonable factors other than age and if the employer meets that burden the plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the dischargeholding that to establish a prima facie equal pay act claim the plaintiff must show that the jobs being compared are substantially equalholding that in title vii disparate treatment case in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case the plaintiff must proffer evidence among other things that she performed her job according to her employers legitimate expectations if the plaintiff establishes the prima facie case the presumption shifts the burden to the employer to produce a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for its actions & \n\ntort claim against defendant notwithstanding the exclusivity provision of the Virginia Act. In other words, the Virginia Act would in no way foreclose the availability of a federal maritime tort claim to plaintiff until plaintiff himself elected to subject himself to the Virginia Act\u2019s exclusivity provision by affirmatively availing himself of its benefits. Such a mode of analysis might not implicate federalism and Supremacy Clause concerns so much as questions of the limits of contract, release, and waiver: i.e., whether an injured worker may contract effectively to waive his right to bring a federal maritime tort claim in exchange for access to supplemental state disability benefits. But see, e.g., Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., 370 U.S. 114, 131, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962) (<HOLDING>). On the other hand, it is not necessarily holding that an injured workers initial election to seek state compensation does not implicate the exclusivity provision to preclude the worker from later seeking compensation under the longshore actholding that acceptance of payments under the louisiana state compensation act does not constitute an election of the remedy under state law precluding recovery under the longshoremens actholding that in the absence of an adequate state remedy one whose constitutional rights are violated has a direct claim against the state under the state constitutionholding that under illinois law silence can constitute acceptance under the terms of the restatement of contractsholding the privacy act to constitute a special factor precluding a bivens remedy & \n\nstatute provides that Any person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee.... 18' U.S.C. \u00a7 1964. The plain language of this statute allows plaintiffs who successfully bring suit under RICO to recover costs and attorney\u2019s fees. It does not, however, provide a remedy for defendants who successfully defend against a RICO suit. Although Hunt argues that case law compels us to find in his favor, the two cases he cites have nothing to do with a defendant receiving costs or fees under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). See Brandt v.

The motion was denied and the defendant was sentenced. This appeal followed. Both the Federal and New Hampshire Constitutions guarantee a right to trial by jury. U.S. CONST, amends. VI, XIV; N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15. We consider the defendant\u2019s argument under the State Constitution first. See State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983). Because the Federal Constitution offers no greater protection than our State Constitution with regard to the rights asserted by the defendant, we need not undertake a separate federal analysis and cite federal law only to aid our analysis. See State v. Bousquet, 133 N.H. 485, 488 (1990); see also Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276, 298 (1930) (<HOLDING>).

Though silence alone does not constitute waiver, silence in the face of contradictory intent to be represented by counsel generally indicates abandonment of the request to proceed pro se.

First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\nand effective administration of justice, particularly when a change of counsel is sought on the eve of trial, primarily for the purpose of delay, and without making any effort to obtain substitute counsel.\u201d Whitlow, 2016 Ark.

An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin.

Consequently, Bank of America failed to meet holding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntaryrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding under similar facts as a matter of law that a knowing and voluntary waiver of powells right to a jury trial has not been demonstratedholding waiver of right to counsel not voluntary and knowing when defendant terminated counsel and requested another attorney but the trial court would allow delay and appointment only upon waiver of speedy trial right & \n\nfailing to obtain a final ruling on the right to consul issue. We agree. In State v. Riker, 123 Wn.2d 351, 369, 869 P.2d 43 (1994), the Court held that a defendant who does not seek a final ruling on a motion in limine after a court issues a tentative ruling waives any objection to the exclusion of the evidence. Similarly, in State v. Koloske, the Court noted that \u201c[w]hen the trial court refuses to rule, or makes only a tentative ruling subject to evidence developed at trial, the parties are under a duty to raise the issue at the appropriate time with proper objections at trial.\u201d 100 Wn.2d 889, 896, 676 P.2d 456 (1984), overruled on other grounds by State v.

As we stated in Dell, \u201cwhere a corporation chooses to represent itself through a non-attorney officer, it does so at its own risk; to do so may be viewed as negligence.\u201d Id. However, the failure of appellant to file an answer through an attorney does not prevent the response from precluding a default judgment. See also R.T.A International, 915 S.W.2d at 151 (<HOLDING>). Appellant\u2019s first point of error is holding that the plaintiff did not establish a waiver where the defendants answer had put the plaintiff on notice of an arbitration defenseholding appellant could not obtain a new trial so that jury could answer liability question because the charge instructed the jury not to answer the question based on its answer to a prior question and because appellant did not object to this instructionholding that where answer omits certain formalities required by the rules of procedure it does not render the answer ineffective so as to entitle the plaintiff to a default judgmentholding failure to object to conditioning instructions waived error arising from the jurys failure to answer question when answer could not be implied and that lack of objection waived right to new trial to have jury answer questionsholding that the defense of insufficient process was waived because it was not raised by the defendant in its answer but later in its response to the plaintiffs request for default judgment & \n\nthat I can let you continue on with this case, so I\u2019m going to dismiss you from the case with my thanks for your service up to this point. And I\u2019m going to release you at this time. Defendant then filed a motion for mistrial pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1061 on the basis that the jury had heard extraneous informa tion in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial, it inquired of the prosecutors and defense counsel as to their wishes regarding the jury in the capital sentencing proceeding. The prosecutor expressed a willingness to replace juror eleven with an alternate juror for the capital sentencing proceeding. However, defense counsel argued that the trial court had err 9, 192 (1971) (<HOLDING>). In State v. Bunning, 346 N.C. 253, 256, 485 holding a directed verdict motion stating specific grounds is a prerequisite for a subsequent motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdictholding that notwithstanding defendants consent the verdict was a nullity where the trial court proceeded to verdict with a jury of elevenholding defendants failure to file motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict did not prevent district court from granting motion for directed verdict for which court reserved decisionholding that district court could not decide after jury returned verdict to treat jury verdict as advisory on issue not triable of right by jury but which was tried by consent of parties to nonadvisory juryholding that after court dismissed case at plaintiffs request notwithstanding the fact that jury had deliberated upon the case and indicated that it had reached a verdict there was no case pending in court on which a verdict could be predicated and the information which the judge got from an inspection of the petition handed to him by the foreman of the jury was information which he received as an individual and not as a judge of the court and further holding that despite violation of defendants right to receive the verdict that was purportedly reached the writing incorporated in the bill of exceptions as a verdict of the jury was in law no verdict because it was not received in court and published as required by law and was instead entirely extraneous and extrajudicial & \n\nargue that the arbitrator must make that decision. Because the court already determined that the arbitrator must decide whether this matter may proceed on a class or collective basis (doc. 62 at 8), defendants contend that the court also must hold that it is the arbitrator who must decide whether the effective vindication exception applies to invalidate the arbitration agreement. Plaintiffs never respond to this argument in their Reply. Doc. 68. Arguably, their failure to do so amounts to a waiver of this issue. See In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015, 1100-01 (10th Cir. 2014) (rejecting petitioners\u2019 argument because their reply brief was silent on an issue and made no attempt to rebut the respondents\u2019 argument); see also Cayetano-Castillo v. Lynch, 630 Fed.Appx. 788, 794 (10th Cir. 2015) (<HOLDING>) (quoting Hardy v. City Optical, Inc., 39 F.3d holding that an appellant who does not respond to an argument in its reply brief waives as a practical matter anyway any objections not obvious to the court to specific points urged by the appellee because the court is not required to do his work for him and dissect the appellees plausible argumentholding that if an appellee raises an argument not addressed by the appellant in its opening brief the appellant may reply citation omittedholding that a reviewing court must address an appellees reply as to preservation of error and an alternative argument in an appellees replyholding a party waives an argument made for the first time on replyholding that an argument raised for the first time in a reply brief is waived & \n\nso requires\u201d and that the amendment is subject to dis-allowance on the trial court\u2019s o t if allowing it would result in actual prejudice to the opposing party or for reasons of \u201cundue delay.\u201d GRE Ins. Group, 822 So.2d at 390. Undue delay can have two different meanings in a case. First, the trial court has discretion to deny an amendment to a pleading if allowing the amendment would unduly delay the trial. Horton v. Shelby Med. Ctr., 562 So.2d 127, 130 (Ala.1989). Second, an unexplained undue delay in filing an amendment when the party has had sufficient opportunity to discover the facts necessary to file the amendment earlier is also sufficient grounds upon which to deny the amendment.

Better Houses, Inc., 820 So.2d 75, 78 (Ala.2001)(<HOLDING>); Burkett, 607 So.2d at 141 (holding that the holding that the trial court properly struck the amended complaint when the plaintiff offered no reason to refute the trial courts finding that the new allegations in the amended complaint were based on facts the plaintiff had known since the beginning of the actionholding that since defendant failed to timely remove the original complaint which was removable based on federal question jurisdiction defendant thereby waived its right to file a subsequent removal even though the complaint was amended to add a new federal claim where the amendment to the complaint did not change the nature of the action so as to constitute a substantially new suit since the new allegations and claims were not substantially different from those in the original complaintholding that pleadings could not be amended where no evidence offered during trial was outside the issues in the original complaintholding that a demand for jury trial should be denied if the issues in the original complaint and the amended complaint turn on the same matrix of factsholding that the trial court did not exceed its discretion in striking the amended complaint where the plaintiffs had learned of the facts underlying the new allegations six months before they attempted to amend & \n\nvalidity of the conviction is at issue, but because the jury needs to examine the circumstances of the offense (as well as any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or prior record) in order to decide intelligently the question of punishment. It is not error to inform the resentencing jury that the defendant has already been found guilty, and to tell the jury that its duty is to determine the punishment to be imposed, considering \u201call of the evidence\u201d presented at the resentencing trial, and \u201call of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d Transcript, Vol. 41 at 2851, 2857-59.

State, supra at 195 (17) (<HOLDING>). Potts raised before trial the issue of holding that once the defendant raises the issue of intelligent and voluntary waiver with respect to prior guilty pleas the burden is on the state to establish a valid waiverholding that record did not show voluntary or intelligent waiverrecognizing that the burden to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional right is upon the prosecutionholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nor by failing to grant his motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for an extension of time. {91} We uphold the constitutionality of the Capital Felony Sentencing Act. The evidence supports the jury\u2019s findings of the aggravating factors charged. The evidence also supports the jury\u2019s findings that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances. The facts of Clark\u2019s case support the conclusion that the jury did not impose his death sentence under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. Taking Clark, the circumstances of the crime, and other similar New Mexico cases into consideration, Clark\u2019s sentence of death was neither excessive nor disproportionate.

Because plaintiff will not be able to prove class-wide, company-wide discrimination with statistical evidence alone, a jury would need to consider each putative class member\u2019s claim individually to determine liability. To prove that an individual plaintiff suffered gender discrimination under disparate impact or disparate treatment theories of Title VII or the Equal Pay Act, an individualized inquiry into each putative plaintiffs circumstances would be necessary to determine whether employment actions taken toward a particular employee were based on gender or instead on legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.

In order to establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, plaintiff must show that (1) he is a member of a protected class, (2) he was subjected to an adverse job action, (3) his employer treated similarly situated employees not within the protected class more favorably, and (4) he was qualified to do his job. See Holifield v. Reno, 115 F.3d 1555, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). It is undisputed that plaintiff is a member of a protected class, was subject to an adverse job action, and was qualified for his position.

After Pendleton gave reasons for the objection, the district court should have determined whether a prima facie case of racial discrimination had been shown. See White, 684 N.W.2d at 505. Instead, the court allowed the state to respond and Pendleton to rebut that response. The court\u2019s analysis was not in accordance with our Batson precedent or the Batson procedure set forth in Minn. R.Crim. P. 26.02, subd. 6a(3). But we have not reversed a district court\u2019s Batson ruling solely because of its failure to follow the prescribed procedure. See Reiners, 664 N.W.2d at 832-34 (<HOLDING>); Taylor, 650 N.W.2d at 202 (\u201cBecause the recognizing that factual findings were clearly erroneous where the record before the court was simply devoid of any basis for the district courts conclusionholding that the district courts finding of no discrimination under title vii was not clearly erroneous because the finding was supported by the recordholding that the district courts finding of no discrimination was not clearly erroneous because the finding was supported by the recordholding that the finding of intent to discriminate is a factual determination subject to the clearly erroneous standard of reviewholding that the district courts application of batson was clearly erroneous but then reviewing the record to make our own determination as to the validity of the objection & \n\nthe burden shifts to the defendant to rebut the presumption of discrimination by \u201cproducing evidence that the adverse employment actions were taken for a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason.\u201d Id. Finally, if the rebuttal is successful, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\u2019s nondiscriminatory reason was pretext. Id. However, where the defendant asserts a legitimate, non-retaliatory explanation for the alleged adverse actions, \u201cthe district court should ... proceed[ ] to the ultimate issue of retaliation vel non instead of evaluating whether [plaintiff] made out a prima facie case.\u201d Jones v.

In this case, the parties do not dispute holding that once the employee makes its prima facie showing the burden then shifts to the employer to prove that legitimate reasons supported the terminationholding that if the plaintiff makes a prima facie case the defendant employer must then articulate some legitimate nonretaliatory reason for the adverse action and the employee must then have a fair opportunity to show pretext that is that a discriminatory intent motivated the employers actionholding that once an employer asserts a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action it has done everything that would be required if the plaintiff had properly made out a prima facie case so whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevantholding in a race discrimination case that close timing is an element of the plaintiffs prima facie case but insufficient on its own to rebut a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason that explains the action and its timingholding that in title vii disparate treatment case in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case the plaintiff must proffer evidence among other things that she performed her job according to her employers legitimate expectations if the plaintiff establishes the prima facie case the presumption shifts the burden to the employer to produce a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for its actions & \n\nage at the time (Gibbs Dep. at 18), it is possible that he was merely relating his own experiences about his ability to heal post-injury.

And the comment was accompanied by Ilardi\u2019s advice that exercise would be good for Gibbs\u2019 healing. (Id. at 37.) In this context, the comment does not require the conclusion that Ilardi harbored discriminatory feelings towards workers over fifty. Cf. Phelps v. Yale Sec., Inc., 986 F.2d 1020, 1025-26 (6th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). The same does not hold true for the comment holding that the defendants comment that the plaintiffs upcoming fiftyfifth birthday was a cause for concern was too ambiguous to give rise to an inference of age discrimination and therefore was not direct evidenceholding that a prima facie case for discrimination requires the plaintiff to show that 1 he belongs to the protected age group 2 his job performance was satisfactory 3 adverse employment action was taken against him in 4 circumstances giving rise to an inference of discrimination holding that the hiring and firing of an employee by the same actor within a period of a few years gives rise to an inference that age discrimination was not the motive behind the terminationholding that a statement of fact relating to the plaintiffs age was not direct evidence of age discrimination because the relevance of the comment is provided by inferenceholding in age discrimination case that plaintiffs dismissal did not give rise to an inference of discrimination when job was subsequently offered to an older individual & \n\nat a specific customer\u2019s site.

Colvin, 340 Pa.Super. 278, holding commonwealth did not establish a prima facie case of involuntary manslaughter after a jet ski crashed into defendants boat because there was no evidence that the defendant could have avoided the accidentholding that the plaintiff made a prima facie case even though there was no evidence of causal connection other than the fact that the plaintiff was fired after bringing a lawsuitholding that plaintiff could not establish a prima facie case of discrimination because she was unable to present evidence that she was qualified for the positionholding that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiffs protected conductholding to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination a plaintiff must show he 1 & \n\nlot of progress, and she- deserved the nomination.\u201d (Id. \u00b6 108.) Moreover, \u25a0 Garcia acknowledges that she was the only candidate Gold nominated for promotion in 2010. (See id. \u00b6 13.) Construing the inconsistencies and facts in Garcia\u2019s favor, I find that Garcia\u2019s assertion that Gold essentially did not work hard enough on her nomination is unpersuasive. In addition, there is also no basis to conclude that the committee\u2019s stated reason not to promote Garcia in 2010 was a pretext for discrimination. In support, Garcia merely states that the committee was composed of almost entirely white men; however, this fact alone does not establish pretext. See Holdmeyer v. Veneman, 321 F.Supp.2d 374, 382 (D. Conn. 2004), aff'd sub nom., Holdmeyer v. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 146 Fed.Appx. 535 (2d Cir. 2005) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, the committee promoted at least one holding that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to gender discrimination and retaliation claims where she had only asserted discrimination based on race and disability in her eeoc complaintholding that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of retaliation because there was no evidence that the decisionmaker knew of the plaintiffs protected conductholding that a plaintiff had not established a prima facie case of race discrimination because she failed to show valid comparators and presented no other circumstantial evidence of discriminationrecognizing that stray remarks are insufficient to raise an inference of discrimination and concluding that a comment by the decisionmaker that he selected a candidate for a promotion because the candidate was a bright intelligent knowledgeable young man was a stray remark that did not raise an inference of age discriminationholding plaintiff failed to raise inference of discrimination where only evidence plaintiff adduced was fact that decisionmaker was different race & \n\nPressure is secondary when its target is some employer other than the one engaged in a labor dispute with the union applying the pressure. To make this distinction, courts inquire into the \u201cobject\u201d of a union\u2019s activity. If \u201cthe object of the union\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, is to bring indirect pressure on the primary employer by involving neutral or secondary employers in the dispute, the conduct is secondary and prohibited.\u201d Abreen Corp. v. Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union, 709 F.2d 748, 754-55 (1st Cir.1983). A plaintiff need not prove that the union\u2019s sole or primary object is to employ secondary pressure, only that one of its objects is the use of secondary pressure. See Pye v. Teamsters Local Union No. 122, 61 F.3d 1013, 1023 (1st Cir.1995); see also Abreen Corp., 709 F.2d at 755 (<HOLDING>). Intent, therefore, is the first necessary holding that plain tiff must show that the secondary pressure is not merely incidental to the pressure imposed on the primary employerholding that new evidence must be evidence that is not merely cumulativeholding that government must merely show that defendant knew that it was a bank that he intended to influenceholding that if the plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of age discrimination the employer must show that the discharge was based on reasonable factors other than age and if the employer meets that burden the plaintiff must show that age was a determining factor in the dischargeholding a parsonage taxable where the use of the property to accomplish religious purposes was only incidental or secondary to the primary purpose of providing a residence for the pastor and his family & \n\nstates, in pertinent part: \u201cAffirmed by Memorandum. The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed. The appellant, Addie Lee Thomas, appeals her conviction and her subsequent sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment for the murder of her common law husband. Thomas raised two issues on appeal. Thomas first contends that the trial court committed reversible error by not allowing a Batson hearing following the state\u2019s use of nine of its ten peremptory strikes against black members of the venire. The original veni-re pool consisted of 47% black members and the final empaneled jury was 50% black. The trial court did not make a clearly erroneous ruling by finding that a prima facie case of discrimination was not established against the state. See Harrell v. State, 571 So.2d 1270 (Ala.1990) (<HOLDING>).\u201d In Harrell v. State, 555 So.2d 263 (Ala. holding that blacks who were not subjected to racial discrimination had standing under title vii to sue over discrimination against other blacksholding that while proper statistical evidence can be the most important vehicle for showing class discrimination the plaintiff failed to compare the percentage of blacks hired for given jobs with the percentage of blacks qualified for those positions and it was not sufficient to merely show that black managers formed a smaller percentage of the manager pool than did managers of other racesholding that the prosecutors use of four of his five peremptory strikes to remove blacks was sufficient to establish a prima facie caseholding that without more the mere fact that the prosecutor used a high number of strikes to remove women from the venire is insufficient to establish a prima facie caseholding that a prima facie case of discrimination is not established merely by the number of peremptory strikes against blacks in cases where the percentage of blacks on the empaneled jury is higher than the percentage of the venire pool & \n\n704, 714-15 (9th Cir.1996), reasoned that the defendant had not made a prima facie case of racial discrimination where the prosecutor challenged two African-Americans in the jury pool but where three others remained on the panel. I would hold that the judge did not abuse his discretion in failing to sustain defense counsel\u2019s Batson objection. Even following our more stringent decision in United States v. Moore, 28 MJ 366,1 am convinced that the prosecutor adequately set forth the basis for her peremptory challenge. The judge concluded that the prosecutor had been forthright in the past and that there was no evidence of a discriminatory intent. 1 . Some examples include the following: Right to counsel. Compare Nichols v. United States, 511 U.S. 738, 114 S.Ct. 1921, 128 L.Ed.2d 745 (1994)(<HOLDING>) with United States v. Kelly, 45 MJ 259 holding an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid because no prison term was imposed and the conviction may be used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent offenseholding that uncounseled conviction could not be considered by court in sentencing defendant after subsequent convictionholding uncounseled misdemeanor conviction may be sentence enhancerrecognizing that felony and misdemeanor dwi are separate offenses because a prior conviction is an essential element of felony driving while intoxicated but it is not an element of the misdemeanor offenseholding misdemeanor conviction for petty larceny triggered disenfranchisement & \n\non any of her claims against Legg Mason. Based on this disposition on the merits, the Court need not reach Defendants\u2019 additional arguments concerning timeliness, administrative exhaustion, and the effect of the release of liability. Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment [Doc. #49] is granted. The Clerk is directed to close this case. IT IS SO ORDERED. 1 . See, e.g., Rogers v. Apicella, 606 F.Supp.2d 272, 284-85 (D.Conn.2009). 2 . Sacco brings discrimination claims under both Title VII and New York State Human Rights Law. Because claims under both statutes are analyzed under the same framework, Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 42 n. 1 (2d Cir.2000), the claims will be grouped together here. 3 . See Petrosino v. Bell Atlantic, 385 F.3d 210, 222 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). \"The critical issue\u201d in such a case \"is holding that the plaintiff must exhaust her administrative remedies and it does not matter that the plaintiff was using state law as the vehicle to press her assertionholding that a single offensive racist comment was not sufficient to establish a hostile work environmentholding that referring to a female colleague as dancing girl or call girl ignoring her except to comment on her appearance and another female employees quitting because of the same person was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment because the offensive utterances do not rise to the level required by the supreme courts definition of a hostile work environmentrecognizing that a jury reasonably could find based on an employees complaints to a superior that the employee perceived her environment as hostileholding that the fact that the offensive material was not directed specifically at the plaintiff does not as a matter of law preclude a jury from finding that the conduct subjected her to a hostile work environment based on her sex & \n\nEastland v.

As the Supreme Court stated in Teamsters, [s]tatistics showing racial or ethnic imbalance are probative ... [in employment discrimination cases] only because such imbalance is often a telltale sign of purposeful discrimination; absent explanation, it is ordinarily to be expected that nondiscriminatory hiring practices will in time result in a work force more or less representative of the racial and ethnic composition of the population in the community from which employees are hired. 431 U.S. at 340 n. 20, 97 S.Ct. at 1857 n. 20; accord Croker v. Boeing Co., 662 F.2d 975, 991 (3d Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>) (citing Wetzel v. Liberty Mut. Ins.

Appellants\u2019 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 Retaliation Claims The district court granted summary judgment on appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims for two reasons: 1) appellants failed to state a plausible claim for relief as to retaliation in their Third Amended Complaint; and 2) appellants failed to advance competent summary judgment evidence demonstrating they had engaged in protected activity. Appellants\u2019 address the merits of this claim only in their reply brief. Accordingly, any claimed error as to the grant of summary judgment on appellants\u2019 \u00a7 1981 retaliation claims has been waived. See Tharling v.

Relying on its decision in Salyer v. Patrick, 874 F. 2d 374 (CA6 1989), the Court of Appeals affirmed. I would grant certiorari to address petitioner\u2019s challenge to that ruling. In Salyer, the Sixth Circuit held that, \u201cdue to their quasiprosecutorial function in the initiation of child abuse proceedings,\u201d social workers are absolutely immune from liability for filing juvenile abuse petitions. Id., at 378. Other courts addressing the question have agreed that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 in some instances, depending on their conduct and the terms of the state laws pursuant to which they acted. See, e. g., Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dept. of Social Servs., 812 F. 2d 1154, 1157 (CA9) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 829 (1987); Vosburg holding that social services attorneys were entitled to absolute immunity for actions related to the prosecution of child neglect and delinquency proceedingsholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity when prosecuting child delinquency petitionsholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity in performing quasiprosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuit of child dependency proceedingsholding that child social workers are entitled to absolute immunity for their actions on behalf of the state in preparing for initiating and prosecuting dependency hearings as well as the formulation and presentation of recommendations to the court in the course of such proceedings & \n\nnot to place the tapes in the investigation file, depends upon the function he was performing at the time the conduct occurred. He is absolutely immune from liability for damages if he was gathering evidence to present to the trier of fact. See Ybarra, 723 F.2d at 679. Bogan and Ingram would be protected only by qualified immunity, however, if they were conducting an investigation to determine whether probable cause existed to arrest Broam and Manning. See, e.g., Powers v. Coe, 728 F.2d 97, 103 (2d Cir.1984) (determining that, \u201cwhen a prosecutor engages in or authorizes and directs illegal wiretaps\u201d and \u201cthe wiretapping is ... investigative in nature,\u201d the prosecutors are only \u201centitled to qualified, rather than absolute, immunity\u201d); Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515, 524 (9th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>); Guerro v. Mulhearn, 498 F.2d 1249, 1255-56 holding officers engaged in search entitled to immunityholding that a judge was not entitled to absolute immunity for firing an employeeholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that when prosecutors joined in implementing the wiretap they engaged in an act that was ordinarily related to police activity and were not entitled to absolute immunityholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nclaims. This immunity applies to the section 1983 claims. Individual immunity is not necessary for the RLUIPA claims. RLUIPA provides a cause of action against \u201cgovernments\u201d and does not appear to allow causes of action against individuals. (A section 1983 claim' against an individual could be based upon a denial of such a statutory right (see Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980)), but such a claim would be a section 1983 claim, not an individual RLUIPA claim.) In any event, to the extent Plaintiffs assert or can assert a claim against individual defendants in their personal capacities specifically under RLUIPA, the Court would find the same immunity and such claims are dismissed. See Mishler v. Clift, 191 F.3d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) (citing Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, holding that as a general rule interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity governmental immunity public official immunity statutory immunity or any other type of immunity are not appealable under the maryland collateral order doctrineholding that prosecutors have absolute immunityholding trial court improperly granted dismissal on ground of immunity because the defendant had qualified statutory immunity rather than absolute immunityholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitrecognizing that absolute immunity is immunity from charges of either constitutional or statutory violations & \n\nliable for this deprivation of Gross\u2019 constitutional rights. \u201cLiability may be imposed under \u00a7 1983 upon one who has a duty to act to prevent a deprivation of another\u2019s constitutional rights, and who fails to do so in reckless disregard of the other\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Hathaway v.

Cartagena, 882 F.2d 553, 560 (1st Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiffs allege that the defendant recognizing affirmative duty of a police officer to prevent the violation of constitutional rights by another officerholding that an alcoholic beverage control officer was a public officer within the meaning of the statuteholding officer liable for deprivation of constitutional rights despite argument that officer although present was not in control of the situationholding that although jury found officer not to have had probable cause for arrest officer was entitled to immunity because law was not clearly established as to circumstances in which officer found himselfholding that the initial stop by officer was based on reasonable suspicion that defendant was impersonating a police officer although another officer arrested defendant for privacy act violation & \n\n96 S.Ct. 984. However, \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate\u2019s preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immunity.\u201d Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606. A defendant pleading absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question. Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 487, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991). The defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity prevails only in part. They are correct that they have absolute immunity for offering the tape recording into evidence at the hearing because in doing so they were functioning as advocates. See Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. 984 (<HOLDING>); see also Butz, 438 U.S. at 516-517, 98 S.Ct. holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from 1983 suits for initiating a prosecution and presenting the case at trialholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding prosecutors immune from civil suits for initiating prosecutions and presenting casesholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nover other attorneys, settled tort cases only pursuant to directives he received from an internal management committee, and never participated in any forum wherein departmental policy was discussed and\/or established. The defendants\u2019 reliance on a string of cases holding that municipal attorneys in positions similar to Selkirk\u2019s were not protected by Elrod and Branti, is irrelevant and misplaced. The very essence of the following cases required an examination of the duties of each plaintiff to ascertain whether his position entailed \u201cpolicymak-ing\u201d responsibility or required political fealty to effectively perform. The Court need not undertake such an analysis here because the Defendants have already done so and concluded to the contrary. See Livas v. Petka, 711 F.2d 798 (7th Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); Mummau v. Ranck, 687 F.2d 9 (3rd Cir. 1982) holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding absolute immunity protects prosecutor from liability for withholding exculpatory evidence from grand juryholding that nasd disciplinary officers are entitled to absolute immunity from further prosecution for civil liability for them actions taken within the outer scope of them official dutiesholding in dicta that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute loyalty from his assistants and could terminate them for political reasons & \n\nrights), and anything less than conduct intentionally directed at the familjal relationship was not clearly established as unlawful within the Second Circuit at the time of Stephens\u2019 behavior in 1990. The Court therefore holds that Stephens is entitled to qualified immunity on McGarr\u2019s familial association claim. See Wilkinson, 182 F.3d at 107. n. 10 (noting, in context of abuse investigation, that there is a difference between evaluating the appropriateness of a case worker\u2019s actions, which \u201cdepends on the facts and events of a particular case,\u201d and \u201cevaluating whether it was objectively reasonable for a case worker to believe\u201d that his or her actions were lawful, which \u201cdepends on the clarity of existing law at the time of those events\u201d); see also Reasonover, 447 F.3d at 585 (<HOLDING>). H. Putnam County Defendant\u2019s only argument holding that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunityrecognizing the fourteenth amendment to the united state constitution embodies a right to familial integrity but stating the parameters of the right have never been clearly established and the right is not absolute or unqualifiedholding that expert report that sufficiently addressed certain claims against doctor employed by professional association was sufficient as to claims against professional association based on doctors negligence because the doctors negligence is imputed to the association under the professional association actholding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity for actions taken in 1983 as any right to familial association was not sufficiently clear such that the defendants reasonably could have understood they were violating it because njeither the supreme court nor this court has clearly held wrongful prosecution and incarceration of a family member violates a right to familial associationholding that defendants claiming qualified immunity to 1983 action were entitled to summary judgment where factual disputes were not material & \n\nit did not reach the question of immunity. Given the conclusions we have reached, however, it is necessary for us to do so. Under \u00a7 820.2, a public employee cannot be held liable for any injury resulting from \u201chis act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.\u201d The City correctly asserts that \u00a7 820.2 applies to county social workers engaged in investigating allegations of child abuse, and extends to other public employees whom those social workers \u201creasonably enlist to assist in the investigation.\u201d Newton v. County of Napa, 217 Cal.App.3d 1551, 266 Cal.Rptr. 682, 687 (Cal.App.1990); Alicia T. v. County of Los Angeles, 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 271 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519-20 (Cal.App.1990) (<HOLDING>). This immunity provides complete protection holding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed in the employees favor and any doubt in its construction is thus resolved in favor of the employeeholding that social workers immunity is designed to protect the continu ing exercise of discretion in favor of the protection of minor childrenholding that in its review of the irs exercise of discretion the court is limited to a review of the administrative recordholding that under mayfield the exercise of discretion based on a mistaken premise of law can be a failure to properly exercise discretion & \n\nthe brief of a pro se appellant, Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993), and thus read Hulsey's brief to argue that Owens and Green are not immune from suit or liability for damages. 2 . Heck v. Humphrey prevents an action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 when the complaint, directly or indirectly, challenges the legality of the complainant's conviction or imprisonment. Id. at-, 114 S.Ct. at 2372. A \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must first prove that his conviction or sentence has been invalidated in a proper pro ceeding prior to bringing a \u00a7 1983 action. Id. If the sentence or conviction has not been invalidated there can be no action for damages under \u00a7 1983, and the statute of limitations does not begin to run. Id.; see also Stephenson v. Reno, 28 F.3d 26, 27 (5th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). Consequently, the statute of limitations on holding that that if the success of a 1983 damages claim brought by a prisoner would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence the prisoner may only bring the claim where the conviction or sentence has been invalidatedrecognizing that 1983 action does not accrue until conviction or sentence has been invalidatedholding that right to payment does not accrue until condition precedent has been fulfilledholding that a claim for damages that would invalidate a conviction or sentence that has not already been invalidated or reversed on direct appeal by executive order by an authorized state tribunal or by a writ of habeas corpus is not cognizable under 1983holding that a plaintiff requesting relief under 1983 had no cause of action unless and until the conviction or sentence is reversed expunged invalidated or impugned by the grant of a writ of habeas corpus & \n\napparent on the statute\u2019s face and the question of their enforcement duties, if any, was not considered in the decision declaring the statutes unconstitutional, nor were the merits of the proposition otherwise litigated. Moreover, where, as here, the state defendants include members of the judiciary who \u201cenjoy absolute immunity from damages liability for acts performed in their judicial eapaeitie[s],\u201d Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 735, 100 S.Ct. at 1976, it is particularly important to give careful consideration as to whether liability is properly based upon the exercise of their enforcement authority since imposition of a fees award might be erroneously premised upon acts or omissions as to which the defendants are immune. See id. at 738, 100 S.Ct. at 1977 (<HOLDING>). Unquestionably, with respect to the holding trial court had no authority to award attorneys fees when arbitrator had stated he would not award attorneys feesholding that a district court may award attorneys fees while the merits are on appealholding merely that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of attorneys feesholding that an award of attorneys fees under supreme court rule 38 precursor to rule 222 did not preempt an award of attorneys fees to which one is otherwise entitled and thus appellant could seek an award of attorneys fees pursuant to section 1577300 which permits an award of fees for a party prevailing in an action against a state agencyholding district jourts award of attorneys fees was erroneous since court relied upon a theory of liability under which defendants had immunity & \n\nan application of state sovereign immunity would in any event eviscerate \u00a7 1983 . as it applies to municipal and county officers. Second, the fact that plaintiffs did not join Cignature Hospitality as a defendant in this suit is irrelevant. Plaintiffs already engaged in several other lawsuits which, as noted above, already have settled. Cignature is not an indispensable party to this action. 17 . After the deadline for the filing of summary judgment motions passed, plaintiffs' counsel expr olding that official capacity claims \u201cgenerally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent\u201d). The county is not entitled to assert qualified immunity. See Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 650-53, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980) (<HOLDING>). 19 .Government officials are accorded holding that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunityholding that officials in their individual capacities may be able to assert personal immunity defenses including qualified immunity that are not available in officialcapacity suitsholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitholding officials in their individual capacities may be able to assert personal immunity defenses including qualified immunity that are not available in officialcapacity suitsholding that government entities may not assert qualified immunity & \n\nfor the State. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 430 94 (\u201cWe can see no substantial difference between the function of the agency attorney in presenting evidence in an agency hearing and the function of the prosecutor who brings evidence before a court.\u201d). Moreover, the absolute immunity the defendants enjoy for offering the composite tape into evidence is not defeated by Cig-netti\u2019s allegations that they did so maliciously or in bad-faith because they knew or should have known that the composite tape was fabricated. See e.g. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 409, 96 S.Ct. 984 (concluding that absolute prosecutorial immunity precluded a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that a prosecutor had knowingly used perjured testimony and deliberately suppressed exculpatory material at trial); Burns, 500 U.S. at 478, 111 S.Ct. 1934 (<HOLDING>); see also Kulwicki v. Dawson, 969 F.2d 1454, holding that an officer applying for a warrant without probable cause may be entitled to qualified immunity but is not entitled to absolute immunityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding prosecutor had absolute immunity for claim for eliciting misleading testimony in a probable cause hearingholding that prosecutor retained absolute immunity despite allegations of witness intimidation in attempt to suppress testimonyholding that a prosecutor accused of knowingly presenting false testimony at trial is protected by absolute immunity & \n\ntacitly approved the policy. Accordingly, I will allow the action to proceed against Stanley in his individual capacity. 4. Official Capacity Suits Barrett has sued the defendants in their official capacities. It is well-settled that the Eleventh Amendment bars suits against state entities and state agents working in their official capacities unless the state has expressly waived immunity, which has not been done by New Hampshire for actions brought under \u00a7 1983. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (absent waiver, neither a State nor agencies acting under its control may be subject to suit in federal court); Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 5.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (<HOLDING>). Official capacity suits against officers of holding that state and its officers sued in their official capacity for damages are not persons suable under 1983holding that states and state officials acting in their official capacity are not persons under 1983holding that under authority of will v michigan dept of state police 491 us 58 71 109 sct 2304 105 led2d 45 1989 neither the state nor state public service commission officials acting in their official capacities are persons subject to suit under 1983holding that neither a state nor its officials acting in their official capacities are persons under 1983holding that state employees acting in their official capacities are insulated from liability for money damages & \n\nthe conduct, \u201cif performed in other than legislative lations, they were fulfilling discretionary, policymaking functions implicating State budgetary priorities. As discussed supra, Plaintiffs claim that defendants acts were ultra vires, without authority, and null and void. Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants were acting beyond the scope of their authority as public officials. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the Court finds that the allegations are sufficiently pled to defeat Defendants\u2019 motion at this stage of the litigation. See Collin Cnty. Tex. v. Homeowners Ass\u2019n for Values Essential to Neighborhoods (HAVEN), 654 F.Supp. 943, 949 (N.D.Tex.1987) (<HOLDING>). At this stage of the litigation, based upon holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants actions were ultra vires in character and that they acted outside of their capacities as public officials arguably deprives the defendants of rule 12b6 dismissal based upon an absolute immunity defenseholding that a plaintiffs breach of contract claim failed because he could make no showing that the individual defendants acted in their individual capacities when they signed the contract on behalf of the employer housing authorityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that the public policy considerations supporting public officials immunity required that the immunity be applied to bar contribution actions as well as direct actions & \n\nCir.1991), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1235, 111 S.Ct. 2863, 115 L.Ed.2d 1030 (1991); Wesson v.

Biggers, 31 F.3d at 284-85, (both upholding the dismissal as frivolous of civil rights lawsuits on the grounds that the defendants were entitled to absolute judicial and prosecutorial immunity). 92 . See Neitzke v. Williams, 490 U.S. at 327, 109 S.Ct. at 1833; Siglarv. Hightower, 112 F.3d at 193, (<HOLDING>); Hicks v.

And, because Dovalina established his qualified immunity from Leal\u2019s procedural and substantive due process claims, we reverse the trial court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Leal in Cause No.2001-CVQ-000765-D2 and render judgment in Dovalina\u2019s favor. However., we do not have jurisdiction over the City of Laredo\u2019s appeal in Cause No.2001-CVQ-000765~D2 and therefore dismiss the City\u2019s appeal. See Bexar County v. Giroux-Daniel, 956 S.W.2d 692, 695 (Tex.App.-San Antonio 1997, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). Leal\u2019s substantive and procedural due process holding that the court lacked jurisdiction over statelaw tort claims on an interlocutory appeal from a denial of qualified immunityholding that local school boards were not entitled to eleventh amendment immunity even though entitled to sovereign immunity in the same degree as the state itself from tort suitsholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitholding that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunityholding a local government sued under 1983 has no immunity even if its employee is entitled to qualified immunity and the court of appeals does not have jurisdiction over the local governments interlocutory appeal & \n\ncourts had held that \u201cabsolute immunity was conferred upon judges acting within their lawful powers, even where the actions allegedly involved serious misconduct,\u201d and that this principle \u201cwas directly imported into the law of the United States as the common-law basis for judicial immunity.\u201d This common law principle is most often used to immunize a judge from liability in civil litigation, but it has also been used to support the proposition that a judge cannot be compelled to testify about his or her thought process in making a decision in a case. See State v. Lewis, 656 So.2d 1248 (Fla.1994) (stating that a judge may not be examined as to his or her thought process in making a decision); Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles v. Marks, 898 So.2d 1063 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005) (<HOLDING>). We can draw the same analogy to the holding order of contempt sentence without statutory opportunity for appeal was in error but nevertheless involved a judicial act subject to judicial immunityrecognizing that absolute judicial immunity is not grounded in any special esteem for those who perform judicial functions and certainly not from a desire to shield abuses of office but because any lesser degree of immunity could impair the judicial process itselfholding that individuals acting in a legislative capacity at a regional level are entitled to absolute immunityholding that a hearing officer acting in a judicial capacity was entitled to claim judicial immunity and could not be compelled to give testimony about his mental process in deciding a caserecognizing judicial immunity for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction & \n\n(1984); providing \u201cample room for mistaken judgments,\u201d Malley, 475 U.S. at 343, 106 S.Ct. 1092; shielding officers from liability when the law did not clearly proscribe the ac tions they took, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985); and protecting \u201call but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law,\u201d Malley, 475 U.S. at 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092. The common theme of protecting reasonable judgment calls by officers, such as this one, exists throughout qualified immunity law. It is not inconsistent for an officer to have violated constitutional rights, as the jury found here, but still be entitled to immunity on the various prongs (described below) of the immunity test. See Sallier v. Brooks, 343 F.3d 868, 871-72, 879-80 (6th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Figg v. Schroeder, 312 F.3d 625, 636-37 (4th holding that transit authority director was entitled to immunity despite jury verdict for plaintiffs because law was not clearly established at the time that plaintiffs activities were constitutionally protected from employer retaliationholding that plaintiffs complaint stated a claim for a constitutional deprivation but that the contours of the right at issue were not clearly established and that official was therefore entitled to qualified immunityholding that officials are entitled to qualified immunity unless at the time of the dismissal it was clearly established that employees in the particular positions at issue in light of the responsibilities inherent in those positions were constitutionally protected from patronage dismissal holding that prison clerks were entitled to immunity despite jury verdict against them because it was not clearly established at the time that mail from the courts was protected legal mailholding that defendant is entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiff failed to allege the violation of a clearly established constitutional right & \n\nTerses a Macias on April 15, 1996.\u201d Id. at 963 (emphasis added). In support of its conclusion that the alleged constitutional deprivation was the death of Mrs. Macias, the district court cited the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in Monell v. Department of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978), and City of Canton v. Harris, 489 U.S. 378, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989), the dissenting opinion of Justice O\u2019Connor in City of Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 260, 107 S.Ct. 1114, 94 L.Ed.2d 293 (1987), and this court\u2019s opinion in Harris v. City of Roseburg, 664 F.2d 1121, (9th Cir.1981). In each of those cases, the Supreme Court and this court treated the deprivation of a constitutional right as the alleged \u201cinjury.\u201d See Monell, 436 U.S. at 692, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (<HOLDING>); Harris, 489 U.S. at 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197 holding that 1983 plainly imposes liability on a government that under color of some official policy causes an employee to violate anothers constitutional rightsholding that although municipalities are persons within the meaning of 42 usc 1983 no municipal liability lies under that statute unless action pursuant to official municipal policy of some nature caused a constitutional tortholding that discrimination against a municipal employee could trigger municipal liability under 1983 through official policy or customholding private actors are not acting under the color of state law for the purposes of section 1983 liabilityholding that a defendant can only be sued in his official capacity under 1983 if he acted pursuant to an official policy or custom in causing the constitutional injury & \n\nKentucky Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, KRS 342.690(1) provides: If an employer secures payment of compensation as required by this chapter, the liability of such employer under this chapter shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin, and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury or death. KRS 342.690(1) (emphasis added). The statute and Kentucky case law interpreting the statute make it clear that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provides the exclusive remedy where a covered employee is injured by her employer\u2019s negligent actions. See, e.g., Shamrock Coal Co., Inc. v. Maricle, 5 S.W.3d 130 (Ky.1999) (<HOLDING>); Hardin v.

(Dkt. No. 19 at 7-9.) Respondent asserts these provisions permit the district director or the director of detention and removal to exercise discretion, and asserts that Petitioner therefore has received all the benefits of due process that he is entitled to. (Id. at 9.) Discussion A. Mandatory Detention Petitioner is not subject to mandatory detention under INA \u00a7 236(c), because that section only requires mandatory dete 7 (W.D.Wash.1997) (<HOLDING>). Petitioner is deportable because of his 2001 holding that we have jurisdiction to review an aliens legal eligibility for relief under former ina 212cholding that an aliens express waiver of his right to appeal to the bia deprives this court of jurisdiction to consider the aliens subsequent petition for reviewholding that the failure to notify aliens counsel of an order to appear for deportation violated the aliens statutory right to counselholding that under permanent rules of hrira the court of appeals lacks jurisdiction over claims of aliens ordered deported for crimes listed in ina and holding that district courts retain habeas jurisdiction over deportation orders of criminal aliensholding that the plain meaning of the statute indicates that ina 236c applies to aliens immediately after release from custody and not to aliens released many years earlier & \n\nImmigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order summarily affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying their application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence. Lolong v. Gonzales, 484 F.3d 1173, 1178 (9th Cir.2007). We grant the petition for review and we remand. Because there is no evidence that the BIA reviewed the petitioners\u2019 asylum and withholding claim, as requested by petitioners in their brief to the BIA, pursuant to the disfavored group analysis set forth in Sael v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 922 (9th Cir.2004), we remand to the agency to determine Sael\u2019s application in this case. See INS v. Ventura, 537 U.S. 12, 16-17, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (<HOLDING>). We also remand for consideration of pattern holding that this court must remand to the bia to allow it to address in the first instance an issue that it has not yet consideredholding deference to agency methodology appropriate unless agency failed to address an essential factorholding that this court has discretion to either address or remand arguments presented to it in the first instance provided it otherwise has jurisdiction over the claimholding that when an agency has not reached an issue the proper course is to remand to the agency in the first instance to addressholding that a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands & \n\nany court.\u201d This court con- eludes that section 440(a) expressly repeals all federal court jurisdiction over the deportation orders of the defined class of criminal aliens, including jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under \u00a7 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review. See, e.g., Mbiya v. INS, 930 F.Supp. 609 (N.D.Ga.1996) (<HOLDING>); Mojica v. Reno, 970 F.Supp. 130 holding that federal court cannot review claim procedurally defaulted in state court absent showing of either cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that courts may only review claims for fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that issues raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered absent exceptional circumstances of plain error or fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that fundamental miscarriage of justice standard requires petitioner to make threshold showing of actual innocence & \n\nJessica Carolina Lopez-Castro, a native and citizen of El Salvador, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review questions of law de novo, see, e.g., Cerezo v. Mukasey, 512 F.3d 1163, 1166 (9th Cir.2008), except to the extent that 9th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>)). We also reject Lopez-Castro\u2019s contention holding that former gang members do not comprise a particular social groupholding that persecution of a woman because of her government job or her husbands position as a police officer was not on account of a particular social groupholding that government material witnesses do not constitute a particular social groupholding that poor yemeni muslims are not a particular social group because group posseses broadlybased characteristicsholding that government informants are not members of a particular social group & \n\nCURIAM: Mirza Azamali Baig and his wife, Yas-meen Baig, natives and citizens of Pakistan, petition for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing their appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) order denying withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). They argue that they are entitled to relief based on a showing of past persecution and a fear of future persecution on account of their political opinions. To the extent that the Baigs argue that they were entitled to asylum, we do not have jurisdiction to consider the issue because the couple did not submit an application for asylum before either the IJ or the BIA. See Omari v. Holder, 562 F.3d 314, 317 (5th Cir. 2009) (<HOLDING>). We generally have authority to review only holding that claims not presented to the ij and bia should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remediesholding that we lack jurisdiction to review a claim not brought before the bia even when the bia addresses it sua sponteholding that we will not review an issue or claim that was not presented to the bia in the petitioners notice of appeal or brief to the bia even if the bia considered the issue or claim sua sponteholding that the petitioners failure to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim before the bia deprived the district court of jurisdiction to hear the issuerecognizing that failure to exhaust an issue before the bia strips us of jurisdiction & \n\nfor review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s removal order. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review \u201cwhether substantial evidence supports a finding by clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that [Valenzuela] abandoned [her] lawful permanent residence in the United States.\u201d Khodagholian v. Ashcroft, 335 F.Sd 1003, 1006 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that the government met its burden of showing Valenzuela abandoned her lawful permanent resident status because the record does not compel the conclusion that she consistently intended promptly to return to the United States. See Singh v. Reno, 113 F.3d 1512, 1514 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); see also Chavez-Ramirez v. INS, 792 F.2d 932, holding that the rule 404b evidence admitted to prove intent was clearly relevant because intent was at issue in the trialholding that the relevant intent is not the intent to return ultimately but the intent to return to the united states within a relatively short periodholding that where congressional intent is clear a court must give effect to such intentholding that the only showing of intent required for a vcea claim is the intent to do the act involvedholding that removal for temporary employment with intent to return was not abandonment & \n\nlima M. Rodriguez, a native and citizen of Colombia, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing her appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying suspension of deportation and voluntary departure. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a. Where, as here, the BIA conducts a de novo review of the record, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. See De Leon-Barrios v. INS, 116 F.3d 391, 393 (9th Cir.1997). We deny the petition. The BIA properly denied suspension of deportation because Rodriguez, who was deported in 1992, did not accrue the requisite seven years\u2019 continuous presence in the United States. Cf. Barragan-Sanehez v. Rosenberg, 471 F.2d 758, 760 (9th Cir. 1972) (<HOLDING>). The BIA properly denied voluntary departure holding that an aliens continuous physical presence is broken if the alien was offered and accepted the opportunity to withdraw an application for admissionholding that the failure to notify aliens counsel of an order to appear for deportation violated the aliens statutory right to counselholding bia did not err in determining request for stay of voluntary departure is not an implicit request for a withdrawal of voluntary departureholding that aliens continuous presence in the country was interrupted by voluntary departure under threat of deportation proceedingsholding that because aliens two previous voluntary departures were the result of implied agreements and were not therefore strictly voluntary they constituted significant departures that precluded a finding of seven years continuous presence in the united states under a rule that excused absences that were brief casual and innocent & \n\nKamal Matian, a native and citizen of Iran, petitions for review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s deportation order, which denied all relief except protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, Femandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, 468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review. Matian\u2019s sole contention, that he is eligible for relief under former \u00a7 212(c), is foreclosed by Armendariz-Montoya v. Sonchik, 291 F.3d 1116, 1121-22 (9th Cir. 2002) (<HOLDING>). See also Saravia-Paguada v. Gonzales, 488 holding that iirira and aedpa are not applicable to criminal alien who entered a guilty plea at a time when alien was eligible for 212c reliefholding that bars on 212c relief do not apply to aliens entering preaedpa nolo contendere or guilty pleas in reliance on 212c availability but that those bars do apply to aliens convicted through other means prior to the enactment of aedpa and whose proceedings commenced postaedpaholding that we have jurisdiction to review an aliens legal eligibility for relief under former ina 212cholding that aliens who pleaded not guilty and elected a jury trial are barred from seeking 212c reliefholding that the relevant date is not when petitioner filed for 212c relief & \n\nSalvador de Jesus Trujillo-Teo, a native and citizen of Guatemala, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 summary affirmance of an immigration judge\u2019s denial of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation. Because the transitional rules apply, Kalaw v. INS, 133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We deny the petition for review. We conclude that a reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to find that Trujillo-Teo established past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of his actual or imputed political opinion. See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (<HOLDING>); Molinar-Estrada v. INS, 293 F.3d 1089, holding that attempted conscription by a guatemalan guerrilla group did not constitute persecution on account of a political opinion where petitioner failed to show that the group was motivated by his political opinionholding that forced recruitment does not amount to persecution without a showing that it was on account of petitioners political opinionholding that persecution was on account of political opinion because petitioners prosecutorial investigation into acts of political corruption was by its very nature politicalholding that a petitioners unwillingness to return must be based upon persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion holding that retaliation for opposition to government corruption can constitute persecution on account of a political opinion & \n\nCourt. See V.I. Code Ann., tit. 4, \u00a7 76(a). Callwood\u2019s petition, in contrast, was filed on November 6, 1997, after the effective date of \u00a7 76(a). A suit seeking a writ of habeas corpus, although admittedly somewhat of a hybrid, is considered civil in nature. See Santana v. United States, 98 F.3d 752, 754 (3d Cir.1996). Accordingly, by operation of \u00a7 76(a), as of October 1, 1991 the District Court of the Virgin Islands was divested of jurisdiction to consider petitions for writs of habeas corpus under territorial habeas corpus law. We have previously held that to the extent that Virgin Islands Code provisions vest jurisdiction in the District Court, they have been implicitly repealed. See Tamarind Resort Assocs. v. Government of the Virgin Islands, 138 F.3d 107, 114 (3d Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>); Moravian Sch. Advisory Bd. of St. Thomas, holding that vi code ann tit 5 76a implicitly repealed a writofreview provision that provided for jurisdiction in the district courtholding that habeas jurisdiction under 2241 was not repealed by the illegal immigration reform and immigrant responsibility act of 1996 iiriraholding that the district court did not have jurisdiction and remanding the matter to state courtholding that application of the exclusive remedies provision in tax code section 4209 deprives courts of subjectmatter jurisdictionholding that postconfirmation jurisdiction was proper in light of plan provision retaining such jurisdiction & \n\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. See, Miranda v. Reno, 238 F.3d 1156, 1158 (9th Cir.2001); Sheikh v. Chertoff, No. C 03-05604, 2006 WL 463506, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10110 (N.D.Cal. Feb. 23, 2006).

Id. A BIA ruling denying a motion to reopen because there is no prima facie case for relief under the hardship exception is such an instance of discretion. Id. In Fernandez, however, we reached the merits of due process claims stemming from the same discretionary denial. Id. at 603-04. To the extent the Cisneroses had colorable constitutional claims, we would have jurisdiction to adjudicate them under Fernandez. Id. Because direct appeal was available in this court, no Suspension Clause problem arises from the district court\u2019s lack of jurisdiction under the REAL ID Act. See Puri v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). The Suspension Clause does not require habeas holding that in its review of the irs exercise of discretion the court is limited to a review of the administrative recordholding that there is no right to habeas review of administrative evidentiary determinations before a district court where direct review of the administrative proceedings is available in the appellate courtsholding that there was adequate opportunity when state court judicial review of an administrative proceeding was availableholding that there is no due process right to appellate reviewholding that appellate review of an administrative agencys factual determinations is circumscribed & \n\nsuffered from past persecution nor had a well-founded fear of future persecution because of his Indian ethnicity. Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s and Immigration Judge\u2019s findings of fact that Petitioner was not credible and that he failed to show either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review and uphold the Board\u2019s decision. A. Adverse Credibility Determination The Immigration Judge denied Petitioner refugee status primarily because she found that he was not credible. After reviewing the record as a whole, we conclude that substantial evidence supports this adverse credibility determination. An adverse credibility finding must be based on issues that go to the heart of an applicant\u2019s claim. Yu, 364 F.3d at 703 (<HOLDING>). Such a finding \u201ccannot be based on an holding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of an adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibilityholding that an adverse credibility determination is sufficient to deny asylumholding that where asylum officer testifies regarding accuracy of interviewing procedures inconsistencies between petitioners asylum interview testimony and merits hearing testimony form sufficient basis to uphold adverse credibility determinationholding when one identified ground for an adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and goes to the heart of petitioners claim of persecution the court is bound to accept the ijs adverse credibility determinationholding that the agency may not deny a cat claim solely on the basis of adverse credibility finding made in the asylum context where the cat claim did not turn upon credibility & \n\nrelief independently of Tan in addition to being included as a derivative party on her asylum claim. See AR at 395-401. The Immigration Judge (\"U\u201d) and BIA ultimately denied his application for cancellation of removal. See id. at 391, 379. 3 . An applicant for withholding of removal need not show that she would be singled out for persecution if she can demonstrate a pattern or practice of persecution of persons similarly situated to her on account of, inter alia, race or religion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii). In the instant case, Tan did not raise the pattern or practice argument before the BIA, and therefore we are without jurisdiction to review such an argument, even though the BIA sua sponte addressed it. See Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., 463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). In addition, she does not raise the argument holding that we lack jurisdiction to review a claim not brought before the bia even when the bia addresses it sua sponteholding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review decisions of the bia refusing to reopen immigration proceedings sua sponteholding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims not raised below by the alien even when the bia reviews the claim sua sponteholding that we lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the biaholding that we will not review an issue or claim that was not presented to the bia in the petitioners notice of appeal or brief to the bia even if the bia considered the issue or claim sua sponte & \n\n460, 463 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cEquitable tolling is proper only when extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d), petition for cert. filed, \u2014 U.S.L.W. -, \u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. June 11, 2001) (No. 00-10520). Because Hatcher filed his habeas petition over two years past the required date for a timely petition, the appeal is untimely and we are barred from reviewing it on the merits. In addition to being untimely, all of the arguments contained in Hatcher\u2019s appeal (except for the District Court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing) have been defaulted by his failure to raise them on direct appeal or in state post-conviction proceedings. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Hatcher admits that he procedurally defaulted holding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that federal courts must defer to independent and adequate state procedural bars in reviewing 2254 petitionsholding that 15a1419a3 is an independent and adequate state ground for a state courts finding of procedural defaultholding that rule 322a is an adequate and independent procedural barholding that in reviewing trial courts ruling on habeas corpus petition reviewing court must defer to all of trial courts implied factual findings supported by record & \n\nMoore, 917 F.2d at 221 (quoting United States v. Vinson, 606 F.2d 149, 154 (6th Cir.1979)). Further, the degree of proof requires \u201ca strong showing of factually specific and compelling prejudice.\u201d United States v. Benton, 852 F.2d 1456, 1469 (6th Cir.1988). Petitioner has fallen far short of presenting sufficient justification for severance. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claim regarding ineffective assistance must, in turn, be denied. In conclusion, for the foregoing reasons, the pending Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus will be denied. This case is dismissed. The Court finds that based on the record, Petitioner\u2019s arguments and applicable case law, a certificate of appealability should not be issued. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c). See Lyons v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., 105 F.3d 1063, 1064 (6th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). An Order consistent with this Opinion will be holding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that the rule applies for purposes of habeas corpus under section 2254holding that district courts have authority to grant certificates of appealability under the recently amended habeas corpus frameworkholding a court cannot issue and make returnable to it a writ of habeas corpus if the petitioner is outside the courts authorityholding that order denying relief under fedrcivp 60b in a habeas setting is the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding subject to the certificate of appealability requirement of 28 usc 2253c1a 2000 & \n\n434 (9th Cir. 1983). However, exceptions to that rule exist. See, e.g., Moses H. Cone Memorial Hosp. v. Mercury Const. Corp., 460 U.S. 1, 9-10, 103 S.Ct. 927, 933-34, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983) (stays leaving plaintiff \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d). In this case, the magistrate was free to recommend to the district court that Reynaga\u2019s action be stayed: if the district court had then adopted the recommendation, we would have jurisdiction over Reynaga\u2019s appeal of the district court\u2019s order because the district court\u2019s action would have \u201cthe practical effect of refusing an injunction,\u201d Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, 101 S.Ct. at 996, and would have left Reynaga \u201ceffectively out of court\u201d. Cone, 460 U.S. at 9-10, 103 S.Ct. at 933-34. See also Marchetti v. Bitterolf, 968 F.2d at 964-66 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). Here, however, the magistrate did not holding that managing conservator while in texas to seek return of child by writ of habeas corpus may not be served with civil process and is subject to jurisdiction of court in which habeas corpus is pending and only for purpose of prosecuting writ of habeas corpusholding that appellate jurisdiction exists over district court order staying 1983 action until plaintiff exhausts habeas corpus remediesholding that habeas corpus petitions are premature until administrative remedies have been exhaustedholding that a federal district court has jurisdiction to stay an execution prior to the filing of a formal habeas corpus petitionholding that district courts do not have appellate jurisdiction over state courts & \n\nbased upon legally sufficient evidence. To the extent that Moye is claiming that the verdicts were against the \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d under People v. Bleakley, 69 N.Y.2d 490, 495, 515 N.Y.S.2d 761, 508 N.E.2d 672 (N.Y.1987) (citations omitted), such an argument raised only-issues of New York state law and accordingly cannot provide a basis for habeas relief, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) (permitting federal habeas corpus review only where the petitioner has alleged that he is in state custody in violation of \u201cthe Constitution or a federal law or treaty\u201d). Federal courts routinely dismiss claims attacking a verdict as against the weight of the evidence on the basis that they are not federal constitutional issues cognizable in a habeas proceeding.

Plaintiffs contend that underwriters do not exercise discretion and independent judgment concerning matters of significance because the underwriters do not bear any responsibility for financial loss and do not determine the financial risk that Huntington will take for any given loan. However, while underwriters do not determine Huntington\u2019s overall risk guidelines, they still make decisions that signifi cantly impact the business and do determine the risk Huntington will accept for any particular loan. Underwriters can approve loans between $250,000 and $1,000,000. Their approval of a loan binds Huntington to that risk, and their denial of an application prevents a customer from acquiring credit. Cf (<HOLDING>). Therefore, Huntington\u2019s underwriters satisfy holding that the analogous predecessor regulation to 29 cfr 541202a did not encompass an employee who made no decisions that affect even the small segment of the companys operations in which his work is performedholding that the fact that the insurance agents perform functions that are an essential part of the companys normal operations is a decisive factorholding that an employer is accountable to a discharged employee for unpaid compensation if the employee was terminated in bad faith and the compensation is clearly connected to work already performedholding futa after which florida molded its unemployment law is phrased entirely in terms of the nature of the employer and not in terms of the work performed or the place at which the employee worksholding that your work exclusion is triggered only where the damage at issue is to work performed by you and is caused by work performed by you and does not apply to damage caused to original construction of a house during later repair work & \n\nNeesen ed., 1995)(stating that \u201c\u2019particular part\u2019 exclusion operates to preclude coverage for the damage to real property which occurs while the insured is performing his work on it\u201d).

When Schauf was cleaning his equipment, he was performing operations on real property within the meaning of this exclusion because he was performing part of his contract to paint the Sodaros\u2019 house. See Goldsberry Operating Co. v. Cassity, Inc., 367 So.2d 133, 135 (La.Ct.App.1979) (<HOLDING>).

The Penn National policies contain no language requiring the cause of injury to be identifiable before coverage is triggered. Our interpretation of the Penn National policies is confirmed by comparable cases applying the first manifestation rule to determine trigger of coverage under third party liability insurance policies. These cases consistently identify the initial manifestation of injury as the trigger of coverage. See D\u2019Auria, 507 A.2d at 862 (\u201c[A]n \u2018occurrence\u2019 happens when injury is reasonably apparent, not at the time the cause of injury occurs.\u201d) (emphasis in orig inal); App the effects of an injury caused by the tort of wrongful use of civil proceedings first manifested when the wrongful suit was filed); Appalachian Ins.

In these cases, there was no potential for an holding that the effects of injury caused by discriminatory employment policies first manifested when the policies were implementedholding that where policies exclude coverage for injuries that are intended or expected the exclusion is applicable if the insured acts with the intent or expectation that bodily injury will result even though the bodily injury that does result is different either in character or magnitude from the injury that was intendedholding that an injury is not within the scope of employment after the employee has left work unless the injury was caused by the employers negligenceholding that where the employment of the injured employees was the occasion of the injury the injuries arose out of employmentholding that employment practices which are neutral in form but which result in discriminatory effects are prohibited unless justified by business necessity & \n\nClaims and Disputes \u00a7 11:9 (5th ed. 2007) (emphasis added).

Accordingly, an additional insured not only reaps the benefits of the insured\u2019s policy, but it also bears the burden of the exclusions. It is further our view that, if the insurer intended to exclude indemnification agreements within insured contracts from the substantial restriction on coverage that the On-Premises Endorsement constitutes, the policy would have expressly so stated. See Maroney v. New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 5 N.Y.3d 467, 805 N.Y.S.2d 533, 839 N.E.2d 886, 889 (2005) (stating that \u201c[i]f the insurer intended to limit [an] exclusion * * * it could have done so explicitly, as it does in the very same policy\u2019s * * * provisions\u201d); see also Chimbay v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc., 742 F.Supp.2d 265, 283 (E.D.N.Y.2008) (<HOLDING>). The policy at issue in the instant case does holding a personal profit exclusion applicable to an insured corporation where the purpose of the exclusion was to exclude coverage when the insured received profits to which the insured was not legally entitledholding that if an insurer intended to exclude insured contracts from the provision denying coverage for injuries to employees it could have expressly stated as suchholding that if an insurer denies coverage based on an assertion that the underlying claim is excluded from coverage there is a presumption that the insurer did not suffer prejudice because prompt notice would have merely resulted in an earlier denial of coverageholding that insured cannot demand reimbursement for defense insurer had no opportunity to control if insured does not promptly notify insurer of facts triggering coveragerecognizing that a conflict of interest may provide the source of prejudice upon which an insured may rely to estop an insurer from denying coverage & \n\na natural condition. \u00b6 18 Thus, even assuming that the negligent actions of government employees or the defective condition of the reservoir or floating dock proximately caused Glaittli's injuries, his injuries arose out of, were in connection with, or resulted from a natural condition on publicly owned or controlled land. See id. \u00a7 68G-7-301(5)(k). Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the natural condition exception to the waiver of immunity is applicable and bars Caittli's suit. CONCLUSION \u00b6 19 Based on Glaittli's pleaded facts, the wind-caused waves on the Jordanelle Reservoir that caused his injuries were a natural condition. @Glaittlif's injuries arose out of, were suffered in connection with, or resulted from that natural condition. Thus, the 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 874 (1992) (<HOLDING>). 4 .

The plaintiffs point out, if the first sentence of the exclusion is interpreted to be all-inclusive, the second sentence is superfluous. In light of the insurer\u2019s duty to define \u201cexclusionary clauses in clear and explicit terms,\u201d Homick, 511 N.W.2d at 374, we doubt that the clarifying language of the second sentence could properly be considered superfluous. In any event, notwithstanding our desire to interpret a policy so as not to render any part superfluous, \u201cwe will not do so when that [interpretation] is inconsistent with the structure and format of the [provision] and' when that [interpretation] is otherwise unreasonable.\u201d Kibbee, 525 N.W.2d at 869.

[21] Having concluded that the court abused its discretion in refusing to permit State Farm to question Woodgett regarding the second accident, we must now address whether this error was inconsistent with substantial justice. We conclude that it was. This exclusion went to the heart of the matter that the jury was asked to decide\u2014the extent to which Woodgett\u2019s accident with Storms caused the headaches experienced by Woodgett and, in particular, the severe migraine headaches. Conclusion [22] The court abused its discretion when it excluded evidence of a second automobile accident involving Woodgett, which was inconsistent with substantial justice. We reverse the court\u2019s judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. See Armstrong, 871 N.E.2d at 296 (<HOLDING>). [23] For the foregoing reasons, we reverse holding that a cause of action on the theory of strict liability may be properly pled by alleging 1 the manufacturers relationship to the product in question 2 the unreasonably dangerous condition of the product and 3 the existence of a proximate causal connection between the condition of the product and the plaintiffs injuryholding that the commission reasonably interpreted the statute as requiring it to assess the condition of the industry as a wholeholding that a logical nexus between the injury sued upon and an unre lated prior condition satisfied the rondinelli test requiring only the possibility that the plaintiffs claimed damages in whole or in part resulted from a condition or event unrelated to the defendants negligenceholding that when the evidence shows that the railroad customarily does not enforce a safety rule the jury is entitled to consider whether that custom constituted negligence and whether it caused in whole or in part the plaintiffs injuryholding that when a possessor knows that a dangerous condition frequently reoccurs plaintiffs had a right to go to the jury on the issue of defendants negligence even where plaintiffs could not show how long the condition remained on the stairs & \n\nsimply wrong. Under our reading of the policy, the CGL coverage does not completely subsume the CPPL coverage so as to render the latter superfluous. In some respects, the CGL coverage is more limited than the CPPL coverage. For example, the CGL coverage requires an \u201coccurrence,\u201d defined as an \u201caccident.\u201d The CPPL coverage does not require an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The CGL coverage also contains an exclusion for bodily injury that is \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d The CPPL coverage does not contain an exclusion for expected or intended injuries. Finally, the CGL coverage applies to \u201cbodily injury,\u201d but the CPPL coverage applies to \u201cinjury.\u201d \u201cBodily injury\u201d is a narrower category than \u201cinjury.\u201d See Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v. Cowan, 945 S.W.2d 819, 822-25 (Tex.1997) (<HOLDING>). Thus, an injury that arises out of holding that bodily injury does not include purely emotional injuriesholding that life sentence imposed for kidnapping with bodily injury was not cruel and unusual even if victims injuries were minorholding that the fatal injury to a murder victim may be considered as satisfying the bodily injury component of the capital felony of kidnapping with bodily injuryrecognizing that when a defendants negligence causes bodily injury the plaintiff can recover damages for past present and future medical expenses bodily injury and emotional distressholding that where policies exclude coverage for injuries that are intended or expected the exclusion is applicable if the insured acts with the intent or expectation that bodily injury will result even though the bodily injury that does result is different either in character or magnitude from the injury that was intended & \n\nwhere the damage can be characterized as being continuous or progressive.\u201d Wrecking Corp. of Am., 574 A.2d at 1350 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

According to the dissent, \u201cthe fact that [Anderson] acknowledged that work may have aggravated his back pain does not mean that he also acknowledged that work caused his back injury.\u201d But Anderson\u2019s injuries were compensable, whether caused in the first instance by his work or whether his work merely aggravated a preexisting condition.

Whether this ruling was correct must remain unexamined. Trimac\u2019s appeal on this issue was deemed untimely by this Court, and consequently, we are constrained to review only Fenner\u2019s post-employment conduct. 11 . Some of the cases the majority offers to support its argument are inapplicable, as well, because they rely on a lower standard than that required in South Dakota. See, e.g., Appleby, 22 Ark.App. 243, 738 S.W.2d 807 (considering whether an employee's actions aggravating a pri- or injury were merely reasonable); Amoco Chemical Corp., 318 A.2d 614 (<HOLDING>); Johnnie\u2019s Produce Co., 120 So.2d 12 (noting a holding exclusion h does not apply where employees were merely negligentholding that it is well established that whether an employees actions were within the scope of employment is a question of fact and even if some of the actions were unauthorized the question of whether the actions were within the scope of employment is for the juryholding that written warnings that impacted the probability an employee would be terminated are adverse employment actionsholding an employees actions in disregarding his doctors warnings were negligentrecognizing as viable actions in tort negligent hiring and negligent retention & \n\nto be paid and which are not, and when.\u201d Id. at 757. As stated in Anderson: A person need not be an officer, director, employee, or shareholder of a company to be held accountable as a responsible person. The test is whether the person had control of the disbursements of the taxpayer, that is, whether \u2018he had the final word as to what bills should or should not be paid, and when.\u2019 It is not necessary that such control be exercised exclusively by the person; it may be exercised jointly with others. Id., 561 F.2d at 165 (citations omitted; emphasis added). In the cases where third party lenders have been held hable under \u00a7 6672, the lender has exercised control over the disbursements of the taxpayer. See Commonwealth National Bank of Dallas v. United States, 665 F.2d 743 (5th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>); Merchants National Bank of Mobile v.

Now, what happens in a case where we proceed against the tobacco companies? Are we collaterally estopped from asserting a synergy argument against the tobacco companies because a jury has formerly held that the plaintiffs injury was not caused by asbestos? And despite that, can the tobacco companies nonetheless proceed and enter a defense and argue to a jury that in fact it's asbestos that caused the injury and not. tobacco? 9 . In Forbes v. American Tobacco Co., 37 F.R.D. 530 (E.D.Wis.1965), the court severed claims again 9, 641-42 (N.D.Ga.1993) (<HOLDING>); Hanes Dye and Finishing Co. v.

In this case, it is evident that Prive\u2019s injury occurred in the context of Dr. Fabian\u2019s business activities. Clearly if Prive had tripped while in Dr. Fabian\u2019s office, see also Harad, supra at 985, had been exposed to disease because Dr. Fabian had improperly labeled laboratory samples, see Doe v. Doctors Bryan, Hatcher, Vick and Gastings, 623 So.2d 722 (Ct.App.La. 1993), or had injured herself moving a patient, see Duprey v. Shane, 249 P.2d 8, 13 (Ca. 1952), a medical malpractice action would not be warranted. As these cases recognize, the proper recourse for a physician\u2019s negligence toward nonpatients is a common law claim for negligence rather than a claim for medical malpractice. See Doe, supra at 723; see also Roe v. Federal Ins. Co., 412 Mass. 43, 49-50 (1992) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the exclusion clause in the holding that a patients settlement of a prior action brought against him by doctors for payment of a bill did not bar medical malpractice action against doctorsholding that doctors conduct toward patient that does not come within penumbra of doctorpatient relationship cannot form basis for malpractice actionholding that doctors may limit the extent of their responsibility to patients by narrowing the scope of the doctorpatient relationshipholding that provision would not be enforced due to that fact that the doctorpatient relationship is special and entitled to unique protectionholding that an obligation imposed by statute cannot form the basis for a statutory employer relationship & \n\n"}

Because Pinson does not allege illegal activity by the BOP, much less present compelling evidence of the same, the names of the co-defendants and third-parties are categorically exempt from disclosure.

See also Sussman v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 494 F.3d 1106, 1115 (D.C.Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>).

The court must revoke supervised release in this ease under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1), as the defendant tested positive on three occasions for cocaine use and admitted to such use. 5. Chapter Seven of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines also applies to supervised release in this case. The Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 treatment of revocation of supervised release is advisory rather than mandatory. These policy statements are only one factor the court shall consider in addressing modification of supervised release. See United States v. Schwegel, 126 F.3d 551 (3d Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). 6.

Id. Preemption is therefore part and parcel with the \u00a7 101 inquiry. For example, we have often cited the lack of preemption concerns to support a determination that a claim is patent-eligible under \u00a7 101. See, e.g., McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2016); BASCOM, 827 F.3d at 1352 (\u201c[T]he claims of the ... patent do not preempt the use of the abstract idea of filtering content on the Internet or on generic computer components performing conventional activities.\u201d). But we have consistently held that claims that are otherwise directed to patent-ineligible subject matter cannot be saved by arguing the absence of complete preemption. See, e.g., Synopsys, 839 F.3d at 1150 (<HOLDING>); FairWarning, 839 F.3d at 1098 (\u201cBut even holding that there was no federal question removal jurisdiction under the complete preemption exception to the wellpleaded complaint ruleholding that removal is proper based on complete preemption only when congress intended the federal cause of action to be exclusiveholding that an argument about the absence of complete preemption misses the markholding that a party did not waive its preemption defense where its answer did not specifically mention preemption but contained a broader defense that was capable of encompassing preemptionholding removal and preemption are distinct concepts erisa preemption does not allow removal unless complete preemption exists & \n\nsuperfluous subsection (C)\u2019s careful limitation to the Secretary\u2019s failure to perform nondiscretionary duties under 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533, id. at 172, 117 S.Ct. 1154.

Rather, plaintiffs allege that the Service \u201cviolated\u201d several aspirational provisions that govern how the Service implements the ESA and, by extension, CITES. See Am.

See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 174, 117 S.Ct. 1154. This Court and others have recently applied Bennett to foreclose private enforcement of similar claims.

Guardsmark argues that nothing in the rule explicitly prohibits off-duty solicitation and that employees would not reasonably so construe it, especially after the company clarified the rule\u2019s safe harbor. We disagree. To begin with, because Guardsmark failed to communicate the safe harbor clarification to all employees who had received the handbook, the Board properly focused on the rule\u2019s language.

Even if the Enforcement Division\u2019s individual investigatory files contained responsive records, NIGC asserts that those files are law enforcement documents which, in the absence of a waiver, are exempt under FOIA Exemption 7(C) because their disclosure \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C); see Melius v.

The Court agrees that NIGC\u2019s investigations holding that nigcs individual background files are law enforcement records subject to exemption 7c and that in the absence of a waiver disclosure is not required by foia because individuals mentioned in law enforcement investigatory reports have a presumptive privacy interest in keeping their names undisclosedholding that names and address of private individuals appearing in files within the ambit of exemption 7c are exempt from disclosureholding that exemption 7c protects the privacy interests of all persons mentioned in law enforcement records whether they be investigators suspects witnesses or informants and their names are generally exempt from disclosureholding that exemption 7c protects the privacy interests of all persons mentioned in law enforcement records whether they be investigators suspects witnesses or informants and their names are generally exempt from disclosure holding that names of private individuals appearing in files within the ambit of exemption 7c are categorically exempt from disclosure unless disclosing such information is necessary in order to confirm or refute compelling evidence that the agency is engaged in illegal activity & \n\nasserts, without citation, that \u201cwhen the patent discloses method and apparatus claims, if only method claims are asserted in the lawsuit and only method claims are found to be infringed, then the marking limitation does not apply.\u201d Halliburton\u2019s Motion to Dismiss (Docket No. 152), p. 4.

On the other hand, a decent respect for the collective wisdom of the jury and for the function entrusted to it in our system, certainly suggests that in most cases the judge should accept the findings of the jury, regardless of its own doubts on the matter.

To hold otherwise would effectively allow the trial court to eviscerate the role of the jury by changing the jury\u2019s verdict to create an offense greater than the one found by the jury.

But we disagree with the defendant\u2019s holding that due process of law requires all courts to insure that elementary fairness toward one charged with an offense is not infringedholding that due process requires appellate courts to scrutinize the sentencing process to insure that sentences are based on reliable informationholding that due process requires state courts to make an affirmative showing that a guilty plea is intelligent and voluntaryholding that due process requires a hearing appropriate to the nature of the caseholding due process clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the charged offense and new york law that requires the defendant in a second degree murder prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter when no element of the charged offense is presumed does not violate the due process clause & \n\nthat the trial court erred in listing McCracken on the verdict form so as to permit the jury to apportion fault between him and Rowell. We agree. Appellants correctly argue that McCracken\u2019s act of committing suicide by jumping in front of a fifty-thousand pound tractor-trailer traveling at seventy miles per hour was an intentional, rather than a negligent, act. See Wyke v. Polk County Sch. Bd., 137 F.3d 1292, 1293 (11th Cir.1998) (affirming the trial court\u2019s refusal to -include the name of a teenage boy who committed suicide on the verdict form because the boy\u2019s suicide constituted an intentional act). Therefore, McCracken\u2019s name should not have been, and should not be, included on the verdict form. See id.; see also Stellas v.

We may not reverse the judgment, based on a jury verdict, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient unless that evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to Mokrzycki, indicates that the verdict was \u201cplainly and palpably wrong and unjust.\u201d Carter v. Henderson, 598 So.2d 1350, 1354 (Ala.1992). \u201cA jury\u2019s award of punitive damages will be considered excessive, as a matter of law, only if: 1) the jury\u2019s decision-making process was tainted by bias, passion, prejudice, or other improper motive; or 2) the verdict goes beyond that necessary to accomplish society\u2019s goals of punishment and deterrence.\u201d Killough v.

The court awarded Gerson $400,-000.00 in damages for breach of contract plus $371,835.62 in prejudgment interest, which had been pled in the complaint. The record reflects that there was competent and substantial evidence presented at trial that fully supports the jury verdict. \u201cCredibility of the witnesses was a jury question. There was sufficient testimony upon which the jury could fix and determine the amount of damages. The testimony as to damages was not so uncertain, speculative, remote, contingent and inconclusive that it could not support or justify the verdict rendered.\u201d McCall v. Sherbill, 68 So.2d 362, 364 (Fla.1953). See also Helman v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R., 349 So.2d 1187, 1189 (Fla.1977)(<HOLDING>); Espino v.

Defendant then filed a motion for mistrial pursuant to N.C.G.S. \u00a7 15A-1061 on the basis that the jury had heard extraneous informa tion in violation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him. After the trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial, it inquired of the prosecutors and defense counsel as to their wishes regarding the jury in the capital sentencing proceeding. The prosecutor expressed a willingness to replace juror eleven with an alternate juror for the capital sentencing proceeding. However, defense counsel argued that the trial court had err 9, 192 (1971) (<HOLDING>). In State v.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 252 Kan. 675, 686, 847 P.2d 1292 (1993). Prejudgment interest is not recoverable when damages \u201care not ascertainable by computation, based on some fixed standard of measurement.\u201d Foster v. City of Augusta, 174 Kan. 324, 332, 256 P.2d 121 (1953). In most tort cases, prejudgment interest is not appropriate under K.S.A. \u00a7 16-201 because the amount of damages due a plaintiff are not \u201cfixed and certain\u201d until a jury resolves questions of fact and the court enters judgment. See, e.g., Whittenburg v. L.J. Holding Co., 838 F.Supp. 519, 519 (D.Kan.1993) (<HOLDING>); Torre v. Federated Mutual Ins. Co., 906 holding that because liquidated damages under the adea are punitive in nature a jurys award of state punitive damages and adea liquidated damages constitutes a double recovery and therefore reducing the total recovery by the amount of the liquidated damages awardholding that prejudgment interest should not be added to damages awarded for misrepresentation because the amount of damages were not liquidated or ascertainable before the verdictholding that the amount of damages in a sex discrimination case was in dispute until the court entered judgment on the jury verdict the sum was not liquidated for ksa 16 201 purposesholding that where the amount of damages was the primary issue in dispute the plaintiffs claim for damages was not liquidated until the date the jury returned its verdict and the plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest under ksa 16 201holding that prejudgment interest is based on the amount of the judgment not the total amount of damages awarded by the jury because nonsettling defendants have no control over settlement negotiations and should not be forced to pay prejudgment interest on settling defendants parts of a damages award & \n\nreview. (d) Martin argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument repeatedly misled the jury regarding the effect of a sentence of guilty but mentally ill. While it was not improper for the prosecutor to state that it would not be justice for the jury to impose a sentence of guilty but mentally ill if it was not supported by the evidence, we agree that it was improper to refer to such a verdict using the phrases, \u201ca break\u201d and \u201ca pass,\u201d and by making similar arguments. We note, however, that such language would have been permissible in the sentencing phase where, regardless of whether the jury had found Martin guilty or guilty but mentally ill, the jury would be choosing between imposing a death sentence or granting mercy. See Lewis v. State, 279 Ga. 756, 764 (12) (620 SE2d 778) (2005) (<HOLDING>). Because Martin did not object to this line of holding that the verdict must be sustained if there is any competent evidence to support the verdictholding that the trial court erred in granting the school boards posttrial motion for directed verdict because although the school board timely moved for a directed verdict during trial it did not serve its motion for directed verdict until the eleventh day after the verdictholding that the statute that provides for a verdict of guilty but mentally ill does not preclude a death sentence as the result of such a verdictholding that a jury verdict of guilty constitutes a conviction for purposes of the federal firearms statute and therefore the defendant was convicted of a felony during the interval between the jurys return of its guilty verdict and his scheduled sentencingholding that where the evidence offered by the state and admitted by the trial court whether erroneously or not would have been sufficient to sustain a guilty verdict the double jeopardy clause does not preclude retrial & \n\naward, do not justify overturning that award. Instead, only \u201cutterly irrational\u201d legal conclusions will be cognizable; \u201c[i]n these circumstances the appropriate standard of review is whether the construction of the contract presents such an egregious mistake that it amounts to an arbitrary remaking of the contract between the parties.\u201d 277 Cal.Rptr. at 714. Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v. Mid States Port Auth., 242 Kan. 683, 751 P.2d 122, 127 (1988) (<HOLDING>); Runewicz v. Keystone Ins. Co., 476 Pa. 456, holding that an award of arbitration cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or the facts if the award is within the scope of the submission and the arbitrators are not guilty of the acts of misconduct set forth in the statute the award operates as a final and conclusive judgment and however disappointing it may be the parties must abide by itholding that manifest disregard of the law is one of the very unusual circumstances in which a federal court can set aside an arbitration awardholding that errors of law without accompanying fraud or misconduct not enough to set aside arbitration awardholding that the trial court was without authority to set aside entry of default on motion to set aside default judgmentrecognizing that a trial court can set aside verdict & \n\n(1993). In \u00a7 2254 proceedings, the federal court must assess the prejudicial impact of a constitutional error in a state-court criminal proceeding under Brecht\u2019s more forgiving \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d standard, whether or not the state appellate court recognized the error and reviewed it for harmlessness under the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard set forth in Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824,17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); Fry v. Pliler, 551 U.S. 112, 127 S.Ct. 2321, 2328, 168 L.Ed.2d 16 (2007). The Brecht harmless error analysis also applies to habeas review of a sentencing error. The test is whether such error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect\u201d on the sentence. Calderon v. Coleman, 525 U.S. 141, 145-47, 119 S.Ct. 500, 142 L.Ed.2d 521 (1998) (<HOLDING>); Hernandez v.

(App.308-09.) This error was reinforced by the verdict form, which forced the outcome of the case to be determined by a single finding of fact: whether Dombroski ordered the landlord to open the door. In Hurley v. Atlantic City Police Department, we held that the District Court failed to instruct the jury that punitive damages against the upper management of a company could only be awarded if upper management was involved in the violation. 174 F.3d 95, 122-24 (3d Cir.1999). We reversed the finding of punitive damages because the jury instructions \u201cfailed to provide proper guidance for the jury on a fundamental question.\u201d Id. at 124; see also Beardshall v. Minuteman Press Int\u2019l, 664 F.2d 23, 26 (3d Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>). The District Court in this case did not holding that the plain error and harmless error standards of review merge in the ease of jury instructions because the duty to properly instruct the jury lies with the trial courtholding that the district courts failure to instruct the jury as to the proper standard of proof constituted plain errorholding that the proper standard of proof is preponderance of the evidenceholding that the courts review is conducted under the plain error standardholding that the failure to properly instruct the jury on the burden of proof required a new trial & \n\nto credit and what reasonable inferences to draw from that evidence. For example, the panel opinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski\u2019s assailant fled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he heard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police. Instead, the panel held that \u201cno rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski\u2019s screams.\u201d O\u2019Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 302. Although it would be entirely permissible for a jury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying the Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between competing reasonable inferences in this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). The panel opinion\u2019s method of analysis recognizing that circumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to demonstrate a defendants guiltholding that where the meaning of the jurys verdict was not clear in light of the trial courts jury instructions the court of appeals erred in directing entry of judgment for respondent the case should have been remanded to the trial judge who was in the best position to pass upon the question of a new trial in light of the evidence his charge to the jury and the jurys verdictholding that an agreement may be inferred entirely from circumstantial evidenceholding that in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jurys verdictrecognizing that competing inferences are not enough to disturb the jurys verdict even in a case where the evidence of the defendants guilt was entirely circumstantial & \n\nlaw. See Anderson, ATI U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510. It follows, then, that \u201c[e]ntry of summary judgment indicates that no reasonable jury could return a verdict for the losing party.\u201d Coach Leatherware Co. v.

The district court stated that although the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cwould have no impact upon the [c]ourt\u2019s sentencing decision,\u201d it would impact the court\u2019s decision if \u201cthe Supreme Court later determine[d] that Blakely [v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)] extends to federal sentencing.\u201d As mentioned above, the special verdict indicated that Soreide was responsible for $7 million to $20 million in actual loss and more than $20 million in intended loss, and that he participated as an organizer or leader. Because these jury findings were identical to those made by the sentencing judge and because they would be applied upon resentencing, any constitutional error was harmless. See United States v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>).

Regarding the \u00a7 1983 claim, they were instructed that appellant had to establish that the officers used \u201cexcessive and unnecessary force to arrest him and hold him thereafter.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict can be reconciled only if a distinction can be made between unreasonable force and excessive or unnecessary force. Although appellant argues that the jury could have found a \u00a7 1983 violation based on the denial of medical assistance, the jury was not instructed on this theory, nor was it argued by appellant\u2019s counsel, and appellant did not object to the lack of such an instruction. Similarly, there was no instruction on negligent misuse of authorized force, nor any claim that the officers\u2019 actions were other than intentional. Cf. Wilson v. Beebe, 743 F.2d 342, 350 (6th Cir.1984) (<HOLDING>). A jury\u2019s answers in a special verdict should holding an agents false statements reckless because she was aware of the true facts surrounding the suspects arrestholding a suspects request for some time to think alone was not an invocation of the right to silenceholding that a suspects ability to proffer an innocent explanation for the facts does not negate probable causeholding cocked pistol to suspects head showed reckless disregard for suspects rightsholding that an officer may search a suspects vehicle incident to a lawful arrest & \n\nsubmitted to a jury. Hale, like the cases before it, recognized that courts can rule on whether a statement is capable of a defamatory meaning as a matter of law. Even if the Montana Constitution did establish a rule that defamation plaintiffs are entitled to a jury trial in state court, that rule would not bind a federal court exercising its diversity jurisdiction. Under the doctrine of Erie R.R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938), federal courts sitting in diversity must apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Hanna v.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that punitive damages are not available under the Act, and we emphasize that the trial court should have made clear to the jury that it could not award punitive damages based upon a violation of the Consumer Protection Act. The trial court\u2019s omission certainly leaves open the possibility that the jury wrongly awarded punitive damages in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Act rather than in connection with a common law claim for recovery. Although we cannot assume that the jury understood the relevant law, since it was not properly instructed, we decline to assume the inverse, as did the Court of Appeals, that the jury found only a violation of the .C.App. 237, 446 S.E.2d 100, 105 (1994) (<HOLDING>).

B. Medina contends that the instruction improperly diminished the State\u2019s burden of proof. When explaining reasonable doubt to the jury, the trial court stated: \u201cwhen we talk about a reasonable doubt we mean doubt from which a reason can be given, a doubt which arises from a fair and rational consideration of the evidence or perhaps the lack of evidence, it means a doubt as would cause a man of ordinary prudence to pause or hesitate when called upon to act in the most important aspects of life.\u201d This portion of the charge was incorrect. It erroneously implies that the jury must find an articulable reason to support its doubts about the State\u2019s case. See State v. Vaszorich, 13 N.J. 99, 115, 98 A.2d 299 (1953) (<HOLDING>).

Morris argues that by not requiring the court to define the limits of reasonable doubt, Mississippi is in effect trampling upon the requirement that the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Mississippi however has a longstanding policy of relying upon jurors to determine whether their doubt is reasonable, and prohibits any instruction that would presume to define the nature of reasonable doubt.

In some instances, even an inaccurate holding the trial court erred in not charging the jury that a defendant had the burden of proving the affirmative defense of comparative negligenceholding that the trial court plainly erred in failing to provide a specific unanimity instruction to the juryholding that the district court erred in failing to properly charge the jury on defendants affirmative defensesholding that trial court erred in rendering takenothing judgment notwithstanding jurys verdict in favor of plaintiff based on defendants properly preserved charge error and concluding that proper remedy was for trial court to grant new trial based on the charge errorholding that district court erred in failing to consider evidence of secondary considerations & \n\nconsidered by the jury in its sentencing deliberations, this same evidence was also sufficient to authorize the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of the statutory aggravating circumstances concerning the commission of rape during the murders. See Berryhill v. State, 249 Ga. 442, 450-451 (11) (291 SE2d 685) (1982) (noting that the jury properly reconsiders all of the evidence from the guilt\/innocence phase in the sentencing phase). This same standard, which concerns the sufficiency of the evidence when reviewed on appeal, applies to Martin\u2019s claim here, which is essentially a claim that the trial court erred by not granting a directed verdict regarding the statutory aggravating circumstance at issue. See Miller v. State, 270 Ga. 741, 742 (1) (512 SE2d 272) (1999) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court holding that the standard for a motion for judgment on the pleadings is the same as the standard for a motion to dismissholding the applicable standard of review in addressing the sufficiency of the evidence is manifest errorholding that the standard of proof for dischargeability actions is the preponderance of the evidence standardholding that jackson standard is only standard to use when determining sufficiency of evidenceholding that the standard of review for the sufficiency of the evidence is the same as the standard for denying a motion for a directed verdict & \n\nguilty\u201d was reasonable, and thus, trial court properly instructed jury to continue deliberating). 36 See OCGA \u00a7 17-9-40 (\u201cA verdict may be amended in mere matter of form after the jury have dispersed; but, after it has been received, recorded, and the jury dispersed, it may not be amended in matter of substance, either by what the jurors say they intended to find or otherwise.\u201d); Groves, 162 Ga. at 166 (\u201cThere must be the unanimous assent of the entire twelve jurors before there is a legal verdict. When it develops that such is not the fact, there is no verdict. If the jury has not dispersed, they should be sent to the jury-room, with the direction to consider the case for the purpose of reaching an agreement on a verdict.\u201d); Handley v. McKee, 8 Ga.

Since Dowthitt, two unpublished appellate court opinions regarding sexual assault of a child relied on Dowthitt to admit videotaped testimony as prior consistent statements under rule 801(e)(1)(B), when the child-victim testified at trial and the videotaped statement was offered to rebut an express or implied charge of recent fabrication 1569537 at *1 (Tex.App.-Dallas Nov.20, 2002, no pet.) (not designated for publication) (<HOLDING>). 8 . During the closing argument at holding that error from the erroneous admission of evidence was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of the defendants guiltholding the error harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding improperly admitted evidence was harmless error given the overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that trial courts error in failing to sua sponte give instruction was harmless because state did not emphasize this evidence in closing argument and evidence of appellants guilt was otherwise overwhelmingholding that in admitting evidence the failure of the trial court to give a limiting instruction sua sponte is not reversible error & \n\nand the prosecutor failed to offer any such explanation. Further, the record shows that the prosecutor did not strike Juror 015, a white juror who possessed the same objective characteristics as Juror 016: both were single, employed females with no children who responded to the court\u2019s questions in the same manner, thereby revealing the pretextual nature of this justification. See United States v. Alanis, 335 F.3d 965, 969 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cPeremptory challenges cannot be lawful ly exercised against potential jurors of one gender unless potential jurors of another gender with comparable characteristics are also challenged.\u201d); Lewis, 321 F.3d at 832-33 (\u201c[A] comparative analysis of D.F. with empaneled jurors reveals that a finding of pretext was warranted.\u201d); McClain, 217 F.3d at 1221-22 (<HOLDING>); cf. Miller-El, 537 U.S. 322, 123 S.Ct. at holding that defendants pretext argument failed because the state offered another legitimate reason for striking the prospective jurorholding that where a nonblack juror with no prior jury experience was empaneled the proffered reason for striking a black juror for lack of jury experience was not genuine and therefore was pretextualholding that the statement contained in a juror pamphlet that a reasonable doubt is one for which should he be called upon a juror can give a reason was obviously erroneous under our lawholding that trial courts denial of motion for new trial based on juror misconduct was justified where there was no evidence presented at hearing on motion that juror had knowingly concealed relevant litigation experience during voir dire and identity of juror as county court litigant was not demonstratedholding that age is an acceptable raceneutral reason for striking a prospective juror & \n\nlittle mitigating weight in tijis case. \u00b6 47 Appellant further contends the trial court erred when it failed to regard the giving of a felony murder instruction at trial as a non-statutory mitigating circumstance. We disagree. This court has held that a felony murder instruction \u201cmay be mitigating where there is some doubt as to a defendant\u2019s specific intent to' kill.\u201d State v. Henry, 189 Ariz. 542, 552, 944 P.2d 57, 67 (1997). Appellant\u2019s actions in savagely beating and strangling the victim to death, however, undermine any argument that he did not intend to kill the victim. Moreover, the jurors unanimously found Appellant guilty of first-degree premeditated murder as well as felony murder, indicating that they found\" intent to kill. See Atwood, 171 Ariz. at 648-49, 832 P.2d at 665-66 (<HOLDING>). We therefore conclude that the giving of a holding that when the evidence shows that the defendant is guilty of premeditated and felony murder a jury instruction on unanimity is irrelevantholding that reversal of conviction for felony murder was required where jury failed to find the defendant guilty of the underlying felony as essential element of the felony murder offenseholding that where both firstdegree and felony murder were possible bases for a murder conviction a jury instruction that suggested the jury could rely on felony murder as the predicate offense for a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder was improper because under arizona law a conviction for conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder requires a specific intent to killholding that the eighth amendment requires finding that a felony murder defendant killed or attempted to killholding that the giving of a felony murder instruction is not a relevant mitigating circumstance when the defendant acted alone to kill the victim & \n\nto credit and what reasonable inferences to draw from that evidence. For example, the panel opinion rejected the reasonable inference that Kotowski\u2019s assailant fled before taking anything of value from the apartment because he heard her upstairs neighbor on the telephone with the police. Instead, the panel held that \u201cno rational juror could conclude that the placement of this phone call frightened him off given the volume and duration of Mrs. Kotowski\u2019s screams.\u201d O\u2019Laughlin III, 568 F.3d at 302. Although it would be entirely permissible for a jury to resist drawing this inference, an appellate court applying the Jackson standard does not have the freedom to pick between competing reasonable inferences in this manner. See, e.g., United States v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). The panel opinion\u2019s method of analysis recognizing that circumstantial evidence alone can be sufficient to demonstrate a defendants guiltholding that where the meaning of the jurys verdict was not clear in light of the trial courts jury instructions the court of appeals erred in directing entry of judgment for respondent the case should have been remanded to the trial judge who was in the best position to pass upon the question of a new trial in light of the evidence his charge to the jury and the jurys verdictholding that an agreement may be inferred entirely from circumstantial evidenceholding that in reviewing sufficiency of the evidence claims we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and draw all reasonable inferences and credibility choices in favor of the jurys verdictrecognizing that competing inferences are not enough to disturb the jurys verdict even in a case where the evidence of the defendants guilt was entirely circumstantial & \n\ncreate such a doubt, it is material even if it would not convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was the killer. Under the circumstances presented by the record before us, we cannot be confident that the result of Harrington\u2019s murder trial would have been the same had the exculpatory information been made available to him. We hold, therefore, that Harrington\u2019s due process right to a fair trial was violated by the State\u2019s failure to produce the police reports documenting their investigation of an alternative suspect in Schweer\u2019s murder. See Mazzan, 993 P.2d at 74-75 (finding Brady violation where withheld \u201cpolice reports provided support for [the defendant\u2019s] defense that someone else murdered\u201d the victim); Davis v. Commonwealth, 25 Va.App. 588, 491 S.E.2d 288, 293 (1997) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s holding that the prosecutions failure to disclose information regarding a witnesss past cooperation with law enforcement did not constitute a brady violation in light of other impeachment evidence in the record including testimony regarding the witnesss extensive drug use and past cooperation with the deaholding claim based on failure to disclose information to the epa preemptedholding prosecutions failure to disclose information of other africanamerican females in vicinity of drug sale constituted a brady violationholding as brady violation prosecutions failure to disclose to defense that prosecution had agreed not to prosecute key witness in exchange for his testimony at trialholding that the failure to disclose evidence known to the defense cannot form the basis of a brady violation & \n\nthat? (Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter. See Benefield v. State, 904 N.E.2d 239, 247 n. 4 (Ind.Ct.App.2009) (<HOLDING>), trans. denied. There was no prose-cutorial holding almost any improper argument may be cured by an instruction to disregardholding improper admission of extrinsic evidence may be cured by adequate limiting instructionholding an error re garding the element of a crime may be cured through further instruction to the juryholding that a jury instruction directing the verdict on one element deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination on every element of the charged offense and thus constituted structural errorholding omission in the jury instruction of element of offense requires a new trial & \n\ncourt harmless. The district court stated that although the jury\u2019s special verdict \u201cwould have no impact upon the [c]ourt\u2019s sentencing decision,\u201d it would impact the court\u2019s decision if \u201cthe Supreme Court later determine[d] that Blakely [v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)] extends to federal sentencing.\u201d As mentioned above, the special verdict indicated that Soreide was responsible for $7 million to $20 million in actual loss and more than $20 million in intended loss, and that he participated as an organizer or leader. Because these jury findings were identical to those made by the sentencing judge and because they would be applied upon resentencing, any constitutional error was harmless. See United States v. Lee, 427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). As for Soreide\u2019s claim of statutory Booker holding that in order to conclude that federal constitutional error is harmless court must find that error harmless beyond a reasonable doubtholding a constitutional booker error harmless on the ground that because the district court stated its sentence would be the same even if the guidelines were only advisory we know with certainty beyond a reasonable doubt what the district court would do upon remandholding that apprendi error is harmless if the court finds beyond a reasonable doubt that the result would have been the same absent the error internal quotation marks and citation omittedholding that booker constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because on remand the district court would have given defendant the same sentenceholding that before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt & \n\nprior convictions, and that he initially lied to the police because he did not think that they would believe him due to these convictions. The defendant\u2019s defense to the charges was self-defense and his credibility was a critical aspect of the case. The jury was specifically instructed that in weighing the testimony of a witness, one of the factors they should consider was whether the witness had ever been convicted of a crime. Thus, the nature of the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions, which would have included the fact that the defendant had never used a weapon, threatened, or harmed anyone during the commission of these felonies, was relevant, and therefore, the trial court erred in precluding the defendant\u2019s testimony. See Lawhorne, 500 So.2d at 522; Williams, 730 So.2d at 779 (<HOLDING>). The defendant also contends that the trial holding that it was error for the trial court to allow the state to question the confidential informant on direct examination about her lack of felony charges when there was no prior attack of the witnesss credibilityholding that stipulation of the appellants undisputed prior convictions was harmless error and reasoning that blakely v washington which does not require a jury determination of prior convictions provides implicit support for the conclusion that a harmless error analysis is appropriateholding that any error was harmless and thus not plain errorholding that it was not error for the court to give a substantive new instruction to the jury after deliberations began where the instruction was given in court with the defendant and his counsel presentholding that the trial courts error in not allowing defendant to testify on direct examination as to nature and circumstances of prior convictions was not harmless error where credibility of the defendant was critical to the deliberations of the jury & \n\nthat there was evidence that Johnson attempted to correct his course after losing control). But a defendant can be deemed negligent for failing to take an action that she should have taken, just as she can be deemed negligent for taking an action that she should not have taken. In this instance, as the majority points out, \"[the evidence here showed that Johnson lost control of his vehicle upon encountering the snow patch.\" Maj. op. at 118; see also id. at 18 (\"An investigation of the scene revealed that Johnson lost control of his vehicle when he hit an icy patch of snow on the road.\"). Thus, the question is whether Johnson acted reasonably-either in taking or failing to take action-after he hit the ice patch and lost control of the vehicle See, eg., Kendrick, 252 P.3d at 1059 (<HOLDING>). The Jury said yes. {88 Second, the majority holding that the attorneys conduct must be viewed in light of the totality of the cireumstances to determine whether that conduct constitutes a violation of colo rpc 8ahholding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that the jury must determine whether the partys conduct was reasonable under the cireumstancesholding that trial court must determine whether fifth amendment violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubtholding that jury instructions must allow the jury to determine the issues presented intelligently & \n\nAs we explained in Part II, supra, it is the role of the trial court \u2014 not the jury\u2014 to determine whether a statement made by a defendant is voluntary and therefore admissible. See id.; Coates v. State, 534 N.E.2d 1087, 1093 (Ind.1989). Trial counsel was under no obligation to tender an instruction regarding the voluntariness of Defendant\u2019s statements, and the trial court would not have been obligated to present such an instruction to the jury. See Abbott v. State, 535 N.E.2d 1169, 1173 (Ind.1989) (upholding the trial court\u2019s refusal to give an instruction on the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s confession which specifically instructed the jury to consider the defendant\u2019s intoxication at the time an alleged admission was made); Gibson v. State, 694 N.E.2d 748, 756 (Ind.Ct.App.1998) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds, 702 N.E.2d 707 holding that trial court did not err in refusing to give charge because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that his requested charge was tailored to the evidenceholding that the trial court did not err in refusing to give the defendants tendered instruction regarding the voluntariness of his confessionholding that trial court did not errholding the determination of the voluntariness of a confession is a determination uninfluenced by the truth or falsity of the confessionholding that the district court did not err in refusing to give the defendants requested instruction concerning his mistaken belief about united states citizenship because the court had given an instruction covering the elements of the crime including the mens rea element & \n\ninstruction notes that if the defendant is not also charged with malice murder, the words in parentheses should be omitted. See id. In this case, although Appellant was not indicted for malice murder, the trial court included the parenthetical words in its jury instruction on felony murder. The court also charged that if the jury found that Appellant was \u201cguilty of the offense of murder with malice af n that the State had to prove malice aforethought for Appellant to be found guilty of felony murder made it harder for the State to make its case, since malice aforethought is not an element of felony murder (although it is not inconsistent with that crime). Instructional errors that could only benefit a defendant are harmless. See Sanders v. State, 283 Ga. 372, 375 (659 SE2d 376) (2008) (<HOLDING>); Brown v. State, 250 Ga. 66, 72 n. 4 (295 SE2d holding that trial court did not err in refusing to give charge because plaintiff failed to demonstrate that his requested charge was tailored to the evidenceholding that because a mutual combat charge authorizes a jury to find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter in lieu of murder it is a charge that benefits a defendant and as such a convicted defendants complaint that it was improper to give the charge is without meritholding that because trial court actually gave part of a jury charge that appellant claimed was improperly omitted and because remainder of courts charge adequately defined one of the legal terms at issue the courts jury charge taken as a whole was not misleading and did not constitute reversible errorholding that jurys failure to address first degree murder charge amounted to a verdict of not guilty on that chargeholding that failure to charge jury that state had burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in the heat of passion was harmless because the evidence did not support a charge on passionprovocation manslaughter & \n\nof the sudden emergency instruction, was appropriate considering the trial court\u2019s finding that the situation lacked spontaneity. Id. In the case before us, a jury could find that a vehicle suddenly spinning out of control immediately ahead of defendant-driver created a spontaneous reaction not necessarily present when vehicles are stopped in the road ahead of a driver who is able to see the stopped vehicles before the collision. Based upon our de novo review, we conclude that the rear-end collision instruction amounted to harmless error and that the sudden emergency jury instruction was correctly given. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice erred in granting the motion for new trial. See Lieberman v. Bliss-Doris Realty Associates, L.P., 819 A.2d 666, 673 (R.I.2003) (<HOLDING>). Conclusion We vacate the order of the holding that trial judge should have granted new trial rather than judgment notwithstanding the verdict because the judge could not know in what order the jury reached its inconsistent verdictsholding that a motion to intervene filed after final judgment should have been grantedholding that the presentation of a new theory does not constitute the presentation of a new issue on which a jury trial should be granted as of right under rule 38bholding that where jury has been properly instructed counsel is not ineffective for failing to object to an instructionholding new trial should not have been granted because jury was properly instructed & \n\na basis for calculating lost profits, reversal is not required where the trial court properly charged the jury that lost earnings were recoverable \u2018where the evidence shows with reasonable certainty the amount of the loss\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted)); Pouts, 222 Ga.

The right to appear pro se is guaranteed as long as the defendant understands the nature of his choice. Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525. In Pennsylvania, Rule of Criminal Procedure 121 sets out a framework for inquiry into a defendant\u2019s request for self-representation. Pa.R.Crim.P. 121. Where a defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently seeks to waive his right to counsel, the trial court must allow the individual to proceed pro se. See, El, supra; Commonwealth v. Starr, 541 Pa. 564, 664 A.2d 1326, 1335 (1995) (<HOLDING>). To ensure that a waiver of counsel is holding that record did not establish knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverholding that a defendants waiver of the right to testify must be knowing informed and intelligentrecognizing requirement of knowing intelligent waiver & \n\nfactor seven, the relative bargaining power of the parties, weighs against a finding that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily made the waiver. An absence of evidence of equal bargaining power does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce prima facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. In short, in the record before us, Bank of America produced no evidence showing that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily waived their constitutional right to trial by a jury. No evidence exists that Martin and Powell\u2019s waiver of their constitutional right to trial by a jury was an \u201cintelligent act done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and likely consequences\u201d as required by In re Prudential. 148 S.W.3d at 132; RDO Fin. Servs. Co., 191 F.Supp.2d at 814 (<HOLDING>). Consequently, Bank of America failed to meet holding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntaryrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding under similar facts as a matter of law that a knowing and voluntary waiver of powells right to a jury trial has not been demonstratedholding waiver of right to counsel not voluntary and knowing when defendant terminated counsel and requested another attorney but the trial court would allow delay and appointment only upon waiver of speedy trial right & \n\nvalidity of the conviction is at issue, but because the jury needs to examine the circumstances of the offense (as well as any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or prior record) in order to decide intelligently the question of punishment. It is not error to inform the resentencing jury that the defendant has already been found guilty, and to tell the jury that its duty is to determine the punishment to be imposed, considering \u201call of the evidence\u201d presented at the resentencing trial, and \u201call of the facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d Transcript, Vol. 41 at 2851, 2857-59. See Alderman v. State, supra at 212 (11 b). 14. Potts complains of the state\u2019s use of a prior conviction for murder based on a guilty plea that was not shown to be voluntary. See Pope v. State, supra at 195 (17) (<HOLDING>). Potts raised before trial the issue of holding that once the defendant raises the issue of intelligent and voluntary waiver with respect to prior guilty pleas the burden is on the state to establish a valid waiverholding that record did not show voluntary or intelligent waiverrecognizing that the burden to establish a valid waiver of a constitutional right is upon the prosecutionholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nchallenge a vehicle search from passenger standing to seek suppression of evidence discovered in a vehicle as the fruit of an unlawful stop, detention, or arrest.\u201d). Now, in response to the district court\u2019s cue, Defendant has raised for the first time on appeal the contention that he was unlawfully detained. In the ordinary civil case, we would have little trouble refusing to address a new argument on appeal under these circumstances. See, e.g., Ramsey Winch Inc. v. Henry, 555 F.3d 1199, 1204 n. 6 (10th Cir.2009) (observing that an appellate court will generally \u201cnot resolve issues on appeal unless they are presented, considered, and decided by the district court\u201d). But our criminal cases have been more cautious. See United States v. Zubia-Torres, 550 F.3d 1202, 1207 (10th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). Because there is no evidence in this case holding that plain error review is appropriate unless there is some evidence that the defendant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of a particular argumentholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent actholding that a defendant must demonstrate a knowing waiverrecognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding that under the sixth amendment a criminal defendant may waive his right to counsel if that waiver is knowing intelligent and voluntary & \n\nwhich was believed to be a mitigating factor. The court again asked defendant whether he wished to persist in his plea of guilty or whether he wanted to interpose a defense. Defendant repeatedly answered that he did not want to withdraw his plea, nor was he trying to plead self-defense. At one point during the extended colloquy the defendant made the statement, \u201cI\u2019ve already waived the right for counsel, so I just plead guilty.\u201d The court eventually accepted the plea of guilty and found that it had a factual basis. Defendant subsequently appeared for sentencing on October 21, 1975, indicated h App. 3d 1005; People v. McCaffrey (2d Dist. 1975), 29 Ill. App. 3d 1088, overruling People v. Hinkle (2d Dist. 1971), 1 Ill. App. 3d 202; and People v. Bobo (3d Dist. 1975), 33 Ill. App. 3d 274 (<HOLDING>). In Hessenauer this court considered whether holding that defendants waiver of counsel when pleading guilty was an implied waiver as to any subsequent proceedings including sentencing four days laterholding that in order for a waiver of counsel to be valid the trial court must ensure that the defendants waiver of his right to counsel is done knowingly and intelligently so that the record establishes that the defendants choice is made with eyes openholding that a waiver of counsel once made and not retracted is operative throughout the proceedingsholding that defendants statements not admissible once he had invoked right to counsel without proof of waiverholding that once the defendant raises the issue of intelligent and voluntary waiver with respect to prior guilty pleas the burden is on the state to establish a valid waiver & \n\nrights,\u201d not determinative.) [original emphasis]. Numerous decisions support this Court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s waiver was not knowingly and intelligently made. See, e.g., Tennell v State, 348 So.2d 937 (Fla. 2d DCA 1977) (only interrogating police officer and fourteen year old boy present when Miranda rights given and defendant signed written waiver, and officer \u201csatisfy[ied] himself that the appellant understood [his rights].\u201d); C.J. v State, 376 So.2d 911, 912 (Fla. 3d DCA 1979) (eleven year old boy held not to have understood rights he waived); Fields v State, 402 So.2d 46, 47 (Fla. 1st DCA 1981) (\u201cwhile a juvenile may waive his Miranda rights, the state bears a \u2018heavy burden\u2019 in establishing that the waiver is valid.\u201d); Hall v State, 421 So.2d 571, 573 (Fla. 3d DCA 1982) (<HOLDING>), rev. denied, 430 So.2d 452 (Fla. 1983); State recognizing that the defendant bears the burden of establishing that plain error was prejudicialrecognizing that distinguishing trespassers from nontrespassers is a heavy burdenrecognizing burdenholding defendant was not entitled to jury instructions on lesserincluded offenses because his request did not constitute a waiver of the statute of limitations on those offenses such a waiver must be knowingly intelligently and voluntarily maderecognizing states heavy burden of establishing that the waiver was intelligently made & \n\nThose requirements include: (1) written notice to the parolee of the alleged parole violations, (2) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him, (3) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and documentary evidence, (4) right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses, (5) neutral and detached hearing body, and (6) written statement by the fact-finder as to the evidence relied on and reasons for revoking parole. Moreover, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has held that the requirements of due process include informing a defendant of the range of penalties involved in the crime with which he is being charged. Commonwealth v. Zanine, 444 Pa. 361, 282 A.2d 367 (1971); see, e.g., United States v. Wadsworth, 830 F.2d 1500, 1504 (9th Cir.1987) (emphasis added) (<HOLDING>); see also Lanzetta v. Board of Probation and holding that waiver of counsel during pcr review requires a judicial inquiry into whether defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counselholding that one must voluntarily and intelligently waive the right to counselholding that a defendant can knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel only after his sic is aware of the nature of the charges against him the possible penalties and the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentationholding that written waivers referring only in general terms to potential advantages of representation by counsel and potential disadvantages of selfrepresentation did not sufficiently demonstrate awareness of the dangers of selfrepresentationholding that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel even though the exchange between the magistrate and the defendant was inadequate standing alone to inform the defendant of the dangers and disadvantages of selfrepresentation & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\nId. at 262-63, 102 S.Ct. 2421 (quoting Barr v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 146, 149, 84 S.Ct. 1734, 12 L.Ed.2d 766 (1964)). Coe says that because Tennessee\u2019s waiver practice has not been consistent in cases with similar circumstances, it cannot serve as the basis for a procedural bar. The state responds by citing numerous eases that establish waiver, and it has the better of the argument. Coe\u2019s eases are mostly either adverse, or too old to constitute current \u201cstrict and regular\u201d practice. The few that remain are isolated and unpublished, and so are also insufficient to defeat an otherwise \u201cstrict and regular\u201d practice. See Delbridge v. State, 742 S.W.2d 266 (Tenn.1987) (not mentioning waiver); Moore v. State, No. 03C01-9212-CR-00445, 1994 WL 17864, at *3 (Tenn.Crim.App. Jan. 25, 1994) (<HOLDING>); Sneed v.

We also observe that if a defendant is permitted to represent himself but the appropriate admonishments as to the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation are not given until after jury selection, they are too late and the error is not subject to a harmless error analysis.

An affirmative expression of assent constitutes a waiver. Id. at 378. In contrast, a failure to timely assert a right constitutes a forfeiture. Id. at 379. \u201cA stipulation is an agreement, admission or concession made by the parties in a legal action with regard to a matter related to the case.\u201d People v Metamora Water Serv, Inc, 276 Mich App 376, 385; 741 NW2d 61 (2007). To waive a right, the language of a stipulation must show an intent to plainly relinquish that right. Whitley v Chrysler Corp, 373 Mich 469, 474; 130 NW2d 26 (1964). However, the use of specific key words is not required to waive a right. See Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1564, AFL-CIO v Southeastern Mich Transp Auth, 437 Mich 441, 463 n 16; 473 NW2d 249 (1991) (<HOLDING>). In this case, in November 2013, Mando recognizing that courts will enforce waiver of appeal rights when waiver is knowing and voluntaryholding unionnegotiated waiver of employees right to judicial forum for statutory claims must be clear and unmistakableholding that clear and unmistakable standard applied to unionnegotiated waiver of employees statutory right to a judicial forum for claims of employment discriminationholding that the word waiver is not required to waive a right even when a statute requires clear and unmistakable evidence of waiverholding that even if the standard for waiver is clear the standard was not met & \n\nor prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation; a warning is a cleareut fact. More important, whatever the background of the person interrogated, a warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 468-69, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1625, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). We detect no indication in this language that the Court intended to distinguish between individuals based on occupation or training in determining when Miranda warnings are required. Indeed, subsequent cases have so held. See, e.g., Desire v. Attorney General of California, 969 F.2d 802, 805 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Longbehn, 850 F.2d 450, 453 holding that although miranda warnings were not given to defendant police officers they had no cause of action under 42 usc 1983 because they were never prosecutedholding that the warnings in their totality satisfied mirandaholding that although defendants voluntarily given initial statement was inadmissible because of miranda violation subsequent statement made after careful miranda warnings were given and waiver was obtained was admissibleholding that although defendant was a deputy sheriff miranda warnings were required irrespective of defendants knowledge of his fifth amendment rightsholding that because miranda warnings make defendant aware of right to counsel and of consequences of waiving sixth amendment rights defendants waiver of right to counsel after receiving such warnings is valid & \n\nof the defects. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(d); see United States v. Velasco-Medina, 305 F.3d 839, 847 (9th Cir.2002); United States v. Arrieta, 224 F.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000). In addition, an alien is barred from collaterally attacking the validity of an underlying deportation order \u201cif he validly waived the right to appeal that order\u201d during the deportation proceedings. Muro-Inclan, 249 F.3d at 1182 (citation omitted). Such a waiver must be \u201cconsidered and intelligent.\u201d Id. A waiver is not considered and intelligent when the record contains an inference that the petitioner is eligible for relief from deportation, but the IJ fails to advise the alien of this possibility and give him the opportunity to develop the issue. United States v. Ubaldo-Figueroa, 364 F.3d 1042, 1051 (9th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Pallares-Galan, 359 F.3d holding that iirira and aedpa are not applicable to criminal alien who entered a guilty plea at a time when alien was eligible for 212c reliefholding that failure to advise an alien of possible forms of relief may violate due processholding that the ijs failure to inform alien that he is eligible for relief from deportation constitutes due process violation where alien establishes prejudicerecognizing burden is on alien when alien is removableholding that there is no due process violation where the ijs finding was not arbitrary and the alien was not denied a full and fair opportunity to present his claims & \n\nlaw that we \u00ed\u2019eview de novo. United States v. Blick, 408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005). The transcript of the plea hearing reveals that Simmons, a twenty-nine-year-old high school graduate, understood the waiver provision in his plea agreement. In his plea agreement, Simmons specifically waived the right to challenge his sentence on appeal, reserving only the right to challenge an upward departure from the Guidelines range established at sentencing, and Simmons averred at his Rule 11 hearing that he read and understood the plea agreement. We therefore conclude that Simmons knowingly and intelligently waived the right to appeal his sentence. Turning to the scope of the waiver, the sentencing claims Simmons raises on appeal fall within the scope of the waiver provision. See id. at 169-70 (<HOLDING>). Because Simmons\u2019 valid and enforceable waiver holding that blakely and united states v booker 543 us 220 125 sct 738 160 led2d 621 2005 are not retroactive on collateral reviewholding that the changes in sentencing law imposed by united states v booker 543 us 220 125 sct 738 160 led2d 621 2005 did not render waiver of appeal involuntary and unknowingholding that united states v booker 543 us 220 125 sct 738 160 led2d 621 2005 does not provide a basis for a sentence reduction under 18 usc 3582cholding that united states v booker 543 us 220 125 sct 738 160 led2d 621 2005 did not alter the standard of review for the interpretation and application of the guidelinesholding that waiver of right to appeal sentence in plea agreement accepted before decision in united states v booker 543 us 220 125 sct 738 160 led2d 621 2005 was not invalidated by change in law & \n\nthe consent, the presence of intervening circumstances, and, particularly, the purpose and flagrancy of the official misconduct.\u201d United States v. Santa, 236 F.3d 662, 677 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cThe proper inquiry is not simply whether [Mr. Scott\u2019s] will was overborne by the agents\u2019 illegal entry, but also whether his consent was a \u201cproduct\u201d of that illegality.\u201d Id. Considering these factors, we conclude that Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was not tainted by the illegal protective sweep of his home. To be sure, Mr. Scott\u2019s consent was obtained minutes after the illegal protective sweep was completed. And we recognize that the fact that Mr. Scott was apprised of his right to refuse the search does not constitute an intervening factor sufficient to dissipate the taint of the illegal sweep. Id. at 678 (<HOLDING>). However, the officers\u2019 conduct in this case, recognizing that unconstitutionally obtained evidence can become so attenuated as to dissipate the taintholding that the reading of miranda warnings and the signing of a waiver of fourth and fifth amendment rights are not sufficient intervening factors sufficient to dissipate the taint of an unlawful entry into a homeholding that consent to search did not purge the taint of an unlawful detention when no intervening circumstances sufficiently separated the consent from the unlawful detentionholding that because miranda warnings make defendant aware of right to counsel and of consequences of waiving sixth amendment rights defendants waiver of right to counsel after receiving such warnings is validholding that although defendant was a deputy sheriff miranda warnings were required irrespective of defendants knowledge of his fifth amendment rights & \n\nappeal waiver. 14 F.Supp.2d 816, 819 (E.D.Va.1998). The court concluded that the defendant could still file a petition under \u00a7 2255 if his claim alleged ineffective assistance of counsel or challenged the voluntariness of the guilty plea. Id. In sum, a \u00a7 2255 waiver should not bar ineffective assistance of counsel claims or claims that a guilty plea was involuntary, just as direct appeal waivers do not bar those claims. General enforcement of \u00a7 2255 waivers, subject to the same exceptions as direct appeal waivers, aligns with precedent from other district courts in this Circuit that have indicated a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to file a \u00a7 2255 motion is as valid as a waiver of the right to a direct appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Smith, 113 F.Supp.2d 879, 898 (E.D.Va.1999) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Tayman, 885 F.Supp. 832, 834 holding that a failure to file an appeal is within the scope of the waiver because the failure does not undermine the validity of the plea or waiverholding the court of appeals had subject matter jurisdiction notwithstanding a defendants waiver of appellate rights in a plea agreementholding that the united states breach of the plea agreement releases the defendant from the appeal waiverholding that a plea agreement with a waiver of direct appeal rights does not include a waiver of collateral remedies because the government could have included a waiver of collateral rights in the plea agreement and chose not to do soholding that a waiver of right to appeal contained in a plea agreement is enforceable & \n\nof services other than a lawyer at state expense. \u00b610 The specific provision at issue here, CrR 3.1(b)(2), broadly describes the various stages of a criminal proceeding to which the right to counsel attaches, \u201cincluding sentencing, appeal, and post-conviction review.\u201d But the right is not limitless. We must also discern the plain meaning of CrR 3.1(b)(2), while taking into account related court rules and controlling case law. \u00b611 The various stages of a criminal proceeding listed in CrR 3.1(b)(2) are more specifically covered elsewhere. For example: (1) CrR 3.1( to counsel under CrR 3.1 or CrRLJ 3.1 beyond what is constitutionally required. That stage is at the beginning, and our motivation was the preservation of evidence. See State v. Templeton, 148 Wn.2d 193, 211, 59 P.3d 632 (2002) (<HOLDING>). Robinson argues the plain language of CrR holding that there is no right to counsel beyond the initial direct appeal and thus no right to counsel in collateral attacksrecognizing that a criminal defendants right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counselholding crrlj 31b1 extended right to counsel beyond the constitution pursuant to rulemaking authority regarding preservation of evidenceholding that agency has the authority to issue regulations prohibiting deceptive practices pursuant to its general rulemaking authority and noting in the statute indicates that statutory cease and desist proceedings were intended to be exclusiveholding that there is no right to counsel beyond the initial direct appeal and thus no right to counsel on discretionary review & \n\nheld that the scope of any waiver by virtue of disclosure was to be defined by the so-called \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d, which'\u201caim[s] to prevent prejudice to a party and distortion of the judicial process that may be caused by the privilege-holder\u2019s selective disclosure during litigation of otherwise privileged information.\u201d Id. at 101. Thus, the extent of any waiver by implication turns on the circumstances of the disclosure. Since the disclosure in von Bu-low had occurred in an \u201cextrajudicial\u201d setting\u2014by publication of a book\u2014the court there held that the unfairness to which the waiver doctrine was addressed was not implicated. As a result, the publication waived the privilege only with respect to the particular communications or portions of communications actually disclosed. Id. at 103 (<HOLDING>) Both dictum in von Bulow and a substantial holding that matters actually disclosed in public lose their privileged status because the cat is let out of the bagrecognizing a public employees first amendment right to address matters of legitimate public concernrecognizing that information disclosed in private is not a public disclosure under the fcaholding that trial court properly refused to permit disclosure of privileged communications in part because use of the privileged information was not essential to the defenseholding that a document which is given to an attorney in the course of seeking legal advice is privileged in the hands of the attorney only if it was privileged in the hands of the client & \n\n"}

Gonzales, 421 F.3d 497, 501-02 (7th Cir.2005). An applicant seeking withholding of removal \u201cbears the burden of demonstrating that loss of life or freedom is more likely than not\u201d if she returned to her home country, Kobugabe, 440 F.3d at 901, but an applicant\u2019s credible testimony can sustain this burden of proof without corroboration, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b). On the other hand, an IJ may find an applicant\u2019s testimony incredible if she \u201cfails to present certain foundational evidence.\u201d Balogun v. Ashcroft, 374 F.3d 492, 502 (7th Cir.2004). While these two concepts can become easily conflated, they are distinct. Essentially, an IJ may disbelieve an applicant because she fails to provide corroborating evidence, and subsequently deny her claim. See id.; Zaid 630 (7th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Though the IJ may have implicitly found that holding that where the ij finds the petitioner to be credible his testimony must be acceptedholding an ij must to address a petitioners explanation for inconsistencies to rely upon them as the basis for an adverse credibility findingholding that an ij failed to make explicit credibility finding when he made passing remark that he disbelieved applicants testimonyholding substantial evidence supported the denial of cat relief where the petitioners cat claim was based on the same testimony the ij found not credible and the petitioner pointed to no other evidence that the ij should have consideredholding that an ij made an explicit credibility when the ij found testimony not credible based on several enumerated inconsistencies & \n\nthe underlying crimes. But a court also cannot be expected to accept wholesale unsubstantiated accusations of egregious police misconduct. This conclusion is not based on an unreasonable understanding of Strickland or an unreasonable view of the facts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Even if Bynum had testified, the only support for his claims of coercion would have been his own uncorroborated and self-serving testimony. He did not present any physical evidence of coercion or first-hand witness accounts of the interrogations. Without more support to Bynum\u2019s story, it was permissible for the state appellate court to conclude that there was not a reasonable probability that the trial court would have accepted By-num\u2019s version of events. See Mahaffey v. Page, 151 F.3d 671, 683-84 (7th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds by Mahaffey v. holding that testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress cannot be admitted as evidence of his guilt at trialholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by finding that defendant had waived the opportunity for a suppression hearing on his confession by first moving to suppress the confession orally at the start of trial when no motion to suppress was filed no hearing requested and no objection to the admission of the statements was madeholding that when defendant failed to appear at scheduled suppression hearing the court could have decided the motion in defendants absence but it did not have the authority to refuse to consider itholding that consistent testimony given by three officers made it unlikely that defendants motion to suppress his confession as coerced would have been granted even though two witnesses to the interrogation had not testified at suppression hearingholding that petitioner was not prejudiced by counsels decision not to call sole witness to petitioners alleged beating at suppression hearing because testimony of arresting officers and assistant attorneys as well as absence of physical evidence of coercion made it unlikely that motion to suppress the confessions would have been granted & \n\nwith Turnage that the postconviction court\u2019s formulation of the second Larrison prong was erroneous insofar as it seemed to focus its inquiry on whether there was sufficient evidence to convict Turnage even without Quantez\u2019s testimony. Under the second Larrison prong, the court is to ask whether the petitioner has demonstrated \u201cthat without the [recanting witness\u2019s] testimony, the jury might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d Williams, 692 N.W.2d at 896; see also Hooper, 680 N.W.2d at 96 (affirming the postconviction court\u2019s holding that second prong not met because \u201ceven without [the recanting witness\u2019s] testimony, the strength of the other evidence presented at trial was such that the jury would not likely have reached a different conclusion\u201d); cf. Opsahl II, 677 N.W.2d at 424 (<HOLDING>). As these cases make clear, the second holding that the postconviction court is the sole judge of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnessesholding that second prong was met because of the seven witnesses who testified for the state in a largely circumstantial case the testimony of five of them was either formally recanted or otherwise called into doubt in postconviction proceedingsholding any error in admitting testimony of expert witness was harmless because it was cumulative of same testimony given by six other expert witnesses who testified at trialholding that second state petition for postconviction relief that was dismissed as an abuse of the writ was properly filedholding that material for witnesses need not be produced to defendant where the witnesses were not called as government witnesses at trial & \n\nadministrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d); Yanqin Weng v.

U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, 426 F.3d 104, 113 (2d Cir.2005), we have never held that a demeanor finding alone is substantial evidence sufficient to support an adverse credibility determination, see Li Hua Lin v.

Ashcroft, 357 F.3d holding that this court can be more confident in its review of observations about an applicants demeanor where they are supported by specific examples of inconsistent testimonyholding that the agency may rely on a lack of corroborative evidence where an applicants testimony is not otherwise credibleholding that an ij may not use general information contained in a state department report to discredit specific testimony regarding an applicants personal experienceholding that conviction can be supported solely by circumstantial evidenceholding that an adverse credibility determination cannot be based on trial testimony that is more detailed than the applicants initial statements at the airport & \n\ndecision is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. While it may generally be possible to permit a party to call a witness without disclosing the fact of his or her prior engagement by the opposing party, there may be little reason to require this effort if other expert witnesses are readily available. See Rubel, 160 F.R.D. at 461. 5 . One such situation may be if on cross examination, the party who had originally retained the witness seeks to attack the expert's qualifications. In such a situation, a court may well decide that the opposing party should be permitted to attempt to rehabilitate the witness by eliciting testimony from the witness that the party had thought highly enough of the witness to consult him or her originally. See Granger, 656 P.2d at 1242, & n. 4 (<HOLDING>). 6 .On direct examination, appeEees\u2019 counsel recognizing split within the circuit on whether the rule is mandatory or discretionary but not resolving the conflictrecognizing the open questionrecognizing but not resolving this questionrecognizing this rulerecognizing without resolving the split in authority on the meaning of the word & \n\n721 S.W.2d 305, 308 (Tex.Crim.App.1986).

See Dowthitt v. State, 931 S.W.2d 244, 249 (Tex.Crim.App.1996) (interpreting accomplice witness corroboration requirement); Brown, 159 S.W.3d at 711; Torres, 137 S.W.3d at 196.

Quinley\u2019s testimony was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that appellant exclusively possessed the stolen rifles recently after they were stolen. Appellant\u2019s reliance on Smith v. Commonwealth, 247 Va. 157, 439 S.E.2d 409 (1994), is misplaced. Smith involved the application of the exclusive possession inference to the Commonwealth\u2019s charge of grand larceny of a truck based solely upon the defendant\u2019s possession of a checkbook and knives which the owner of the truck had left in the truck but had not seen for months prior to the theft. In Smith, the evidence failed to prove that the truck, checkbook, and knives were stolen at the same time. Cf. Williams v. Commonwealth, 188 Va. 583, 597, 50 S.E.2d 407, 414 (1948) (<HOLDING>). Consequently, the Court found that the holding that a defendant may be convicted of theft twice on the basis of intentional possession at one time of stolen property if the property forming the basis of the one conviction was stolen at different times and places from different owners than the property forming the basis of the second convictionholding that the officers examination revealed that there was probable cause to believe that the property was stolenholding proof of possession of stolen goods is sufficient evidence to sustain conviction for theftholding that exclusive possession of recently stolen goods warrants the inference that he stole all of the property for which the defendant is accused of taking provided all the property was stolen at the same time emphasis addedrecognizing that defendants intent to return stolen items to their rightful owner is a valid defense to charge of receiving stolen property & \n\nof death or serious bodily injury, (2) a well-grounded fear that the threat will be carried out, and (3) lack of a reasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.\u201d United States v. Moreno, 102 F.3d 994, 997 (9th Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Becerra, 992 F.2d 960, 964 (9th Cir.1993)). Duenas-Gonzalez was not entitled to a new trial on his claimed Brady violation or on the ground of newly discovered evidence. Contrary to Duenas-Gonzalez\u2019s contention, no Brady violation occurred. The government offered neither false evidence nor perjured testimony. See United States v. Endicott, 869 F.2d 452, 455 (9th Cir.1989) (noting that the prosecution\u2019s inadvertent use of perjured testimony can constitute a Brady violation); Cf. United States v. Young, 17 F.3d 1201, 1204 (9th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). Nor did the government withhold evidence holding reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeholding that a new trial was warranted where there is reasonable probability that the false testimony introduced by the government influenced the outcome of the trialholding that there is a presumption that new evidence discovered by criminal defendant after trial is over would not change outcome of trialholding that petitioner failed to establish a reasonable probability that had his trial counsel interviewed renee and called her as a witness at trial the trial outcome would have been different because renees testimony wholly lacked credibilityholding that a reasonable probability is one that in the judgment of the reviewing court is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceeding citation omitted & \n\nis common in adversary proceedings for expert witnesses to be present during the presentation of factual testimony so that they have a foundation on which to base their opinions. See, e.g., Federal Rule of Evidence 615. Although that Rule authorizes a district court to sequester witnesses to prevent them from hearing the testimony of other witnesses, it also provides several exceptions, including an exception for \u201ca person whose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the party\u2019s cause.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3). The Advisory Committee notes specify that this exception contemplates \u201can expert needed to advise counsel in the management of the litigation.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 615(3) Advisory Committee notes. See United States v. Mohney, 949 F.2d 1397, 1404-05 (6th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>); Morvant v. Construction Aggregates Corp., 570 holding that a witness may testify about his subjective interpretation of a conversation in which he is participating as long as his opinion is rationally based on his perception and is helpful either to an understanding of his testimony or to the determination of a fact in issueholding that in order to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to call a witness to testify the claimant must allege 1 the identity of the potential witness 2 that the witness was available to testify at trial 3 the substance of the witnesss testimony and 4 an explanation of how the omission of the testimony prejudiced the caseholding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing plaintiffs expert witness to testify when it also allowed defendants expert witness who disputed the methodology used by plaintiffs expert to testifyholding that the presence in the courtroom of an expert witness who does not testify to the facts of the case but rather gives his opinion based upon the testimony of others hardly seems suspect and will in most cases be beneficial for he will be more likely to base his expert opinion on a more accurate understanding of the testimony as it evolves before the juryholding that an expert witnesss testimony on an ultimate issue was admissible recognizing that the expert did not specifically testify that the defendant was guilty or that as a matter of law the facts satisfied the applicable legal standard & \n\n(finding objections on hearsay and foundational ground sufficient to preserve a Sixth Amendment claim for appeal because of the close relationship between hearsay and confrontation), aff'd 933 N.E.2d 1271 (Ind.2010). The best practice is for attorneys to make both objections when applicable. The failure to do so in this case is not particularly egregious; because the trial court concluded that the testimony was not hearsay, it seems unlikely that the trial court would have sustained an objection based on the Confrontation Clause. Regardless, we agree with the State that Officer Thompson\u2019s testimony was not \u201ctestimonial hearsay,\u201d the type of hearsay barred pursuant to the Confrontation Clause. See Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 821, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (<HOLDING>). Davis described the distinction between holding that the admission of testimonial statements against a defendant is unconstitutional when the declarant does not appear at trial unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for crossexaminationholding that the confrontation clause bars admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless the witness was unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for crossexaminationholding that the admission of prior testimony that had been subjected to crossexamination violated the confrontation clause because the state did not prove that the witness was unavailableholding that outofcourt statements by witnesses that are testimonial in nature are barred under the confrontation clause unless witnesses are unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to crossexamine themholding the confrontation clause applies only to testimonial statements & \n\nthe only major issue was the identity of the robbers.\u201d Id. 21 .Similarly, if the defense indicates that it will present evidence during its case to impeach the testimony of a State witness (as in Milligan and Cobh), there is no concern that the State will not have the \"predicate issue\u201d to justify offering further evidence to refute the defense evidence during the State\u2019s rebuttal case. 22 . The legislature has established entrapment as an affirmative defense with the concomitant burden of proof on the defendant rather than as an element of an offense to be negated in the State\u2019s prima facie case. See 11 Del. C. \u00a7 432(a). 23 . Arguments by counsel during opening statements and summation are not evidence and thus cannot be said to raise an affirmative defense. Cf. Milligan 761 A.2d at 8 (<HOLDING>). 24 . Cf. United States v. Bailey, D.C.Cir., holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence where the evidence would serve only to impeach testimonyholding that evidence of a later sexual encounter that triggered the delayed report was admissible only after milligan had in fact introduced evidence of late reporting to impeach the victims testimonyholding that remedial measures evidence was not admissible to impeach testimony that at the time of the event the measure was not believed to be as practical as the one employedrecognizing that if the government introduced evidence tending to show that the victims did not expect to engage in prostitution it will have put those victims sexual histories at issue and under those circumstances it is possible that evidence rebutting the governments allegations might be admissible under the constitutional exceptionholding that evidence of prior uncharged sexual conduct with the victim is admissible to corroborate the victims testimony & \n\nof leniency in exchange for testimony is a recognized and established activity of federal prosecutors in the investigation and prosecution of criminal activity. \u201cNo practice is more ingrained in our criminal justice system than the practice of the government calling a witness who is an accessory to the crime for which the defendant is charged and having that witness testify under a plea bargain that promises him a reduced sentence.\u201d United States v. Cervantes-Pacheco, 826 F.2d 310, 315 (5th Cir.1987) (en banc), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1026, 108 S.Ct. 749, 98 L.Ed.2d 762 (1988). This traditional prosecutorial granting of leniency has, throughout history, been sanctioned by the courts as well. See, e.g., United States v. Ford, 99 U.S. 594, 604, 25 L.Ed. 399 (1878) (The Whiskey cases) (<HOLDING>). The case law is replete with instances of holding that a public prosecutor is permitted to induce a witness to fully and fairly testify to the guilt of his associates in exchange for the prosecutors recommendation for executive clemencyholding that promises made by the prosecution to a witness in exchange for that witness testimony relate directly to the credibility of the witnessholding that the witness had accepted immunity in exchange for no prosecutionholding that in order to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel based on the failure to call a witness to testify the claimant must allege 1 the identity of the potential witness 2 that the witness was available to testify at trial 3 the substance of the witnesss testimony and 4 an explanation of how the omission of the testimony prejudiced the caseholding that the jury could have reasonably inferred the requisite intent to induce the witness to lie or testify falsely from the defendants statements to the witness & \n\ntranscript of jury request to review witness testimony (D.Mass. Dec. 7, 1995); United States v. DeBartolomeo, 95-CR-10239-WGY, trial transcript of jury request to review witness testimony (D.Mass. Jan. 22, 1996). 2 . Against this background, the current proposals to authorize \"real time\u201d court reporters to provide \"unscoped\u201d transcripts for a fee seem odd indeed. They wholly misconceive real time court reporting as some sort of \u201cproduct,\u201d rather than the vital, justice-enhancing \u201cservice\u201d it is in fact. More importantly, unscoped transcripts can in no sense be said to be accurate \"records\u201d of the judicial proceedings. There is only one such record \u2014 the record certified by the court's official reporter. See e.g., United States v. Abrams, 95-10272-WGY (transcript) (D.Mass. Feb. 2, 1996) recognizing that the only record of grand jury testimony is the court reporters certified transcript not her tape recording of the proceedingholding the trial court erred in ordering the transcription of grand jury proceedings so that it could intervene in the operations of the grand juryholding that a defendants false grand jury testimony was insufficient to establish perjury where the defendant was called before the grand jury for the mere purpose of laying the foundation for a perjury prosecution such testimony was immaterial to the grand jurys purposeholding where tape corroborated by independent testimony of two police officers and where defendant did not challenge accuracy of recording court did not err in admitting tape despite prosecutions failure to authenticate itholding that the defendants offer of proof which consisted only of a tape recording and a private investigators affidavit did not satisfy the defendants preliminary burden under franks without the offering of other sworn testimony or reliable evidence & \n\nnot testify as a nonexpert fact witness about what he did and directly observed during the reenactment. Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\nof the victim\u2019s conduct. See \u00a7 90.405, Fla. Stat. (2009). There are, however, important distinctions and evi-dentiary requirements between reputation evidence and evidence of specific acts admitted under section 90.404(l)(b). Grace v. State, 832 So.2d 224, 226 (Fla. 2d DCA 2002); Pino, 389 So.2d at 1194. The purpose of introducing the reputation evidence in a self-defense case is to show that the victim was the initial aggressor. Pino, 389 So.2d at 1194. Reputation evidence is offered to show that the victim acted in conformity with a known character trait. Because reputation evidence relates to the conduct of the victim, the defendant is not required to have had prior knowledge of the victim\u2019s reputation in the community. See Dwyer v. State, 743 So.2d 46, 48 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999) (<HOLDING>) (citations omitted); Melvin v. State, 592 holding that evidence of assault on victim that was subsequent to the arson for which defendant was tried was admissible to show defendants bent of mind toward violence directed at the victimholding that uncharged sexual acts committed upon the same victim are admissible to show the conduct of the defendant toward the victim and to corroborate the evidence of the offense charged in the indictmentholding that a defendant who alleges selfdefense can show through the testimony of another witness that the alleged victim had a propensity for violence thereby inferring that the alleged victim was the aggressor a defendants prior knowledge of the victims reputation for violence is irrelevant because the evidence is offered to show the conduct of the victim rather than the defendants state of mindholding that before a defendant is entitled to introduce evidence of the victims character for violence there must be sufficient evidence to support a finding that the victim was the first aggressor and that once the defendant testified that he was attacked and cut by the victim without provocation before using the victims utility tool to stab the victim the defendant was clearly entitled to question the victim about past acts of violence reflected in court documents from the state of oregonholding that corroborative evidence of prior specific acts of violence by victim may be admissible in selfdefense case where the defendant knew of the act & \n\nMorris intriguingly argues that he could not have been guilty beyond a reasonable doubt because Mississippi does not permit an instruction defining the limits of reasonable doubt. Morris argues that by not requiring the court to define the limits of reasonable doubt, Mississippi is in effect trampling upon the requirement that the State prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. Mississippi however has a longstanding policy of relying upon jurors to determine whether their doubt is reasonable, and prohibits any instruction that would presume to define the nature of reasonable doubt. Isaacks v. State, 337 So.2d 928, 930 (Miss.1976). \u00b6 9. We find no error in the refusal of the requested instruction. III.

In this case, the trial court made the determination required by West Virginia Code \u00a7 57-5-2 that the interests of justice required a grant of immunity to Ms. Day so that she could freely offer her testimony without fear of additional prosecution for any events associated with the murder of the victim.

CRE 103; People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965 (Colo.App.1983). Kruse, 819 P.2d at 551 (Van Cise, J., dissenting). We agree with Judge Van Cise. The protection provided by section 16-8-107(1) should not have been addressed by the court of appeals. The general rule is that failure to make a timely and sufficient objection during the trial constitutes a waiver of that ground on appeal. Larkin v. People, 177 Colo. 156, 160, 493 P.2d 1, 3 (1972); People v. Browning, 809 P.2d 1086, 1088 (Colo.App.1990). Kruse waived his objection to the admission of Ortiz\u2019s testimony under section 16-8-107(1) by failing to properly object at trial. People v. Watson, 668 P.2d 965, 966-67 (Colo.App.1983) (<HOLDING>). An exception to the general rule exists, holding that defendant must have clearly objected at trial to the matter he is raising on appealholding that appellate court could not consider objection to testimony when defendant objected at trial on different groundsholding that error was preserved when defendant objected to question regarding defendant was under arrest immediately following question about postarrest event sufficient to put trial court on notice of appellants state constitutional grounds for objectionholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewholding that claims based on grounds not objected to at trial cannot be considered on appeal & \n\nhearsay rule. In resolving this issue, we initially observe that a trial court has broad discretion in ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and we will reverse only when the trial court has abused its discretion. Jones v. State, 800 N.E.2d 624, 626-27 (Ind.Ct.App.2003). An abuse of discretion will only be found if the trial court\u2019s decision is clearly against the logic and effect of the facts and circumstances before the court. Id. at 627. Although Davis contends on appeal that the police report should have been excluded because it was not properly authenticated, we note that Davis objected to the admission of the report at trial only on the grounds that the report constituted hearsay. As a result, Davis has waived this argument. See Small v. State, 736 N.E.2d 742, 747 (Ind.2000) (<HOLDING>). In addressing Davis\u2019s claim that the police holding that the defendant may not state one ground at trial and another on appealholding party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal where appellant did not object to testimony at trial on the grounds raised on appeal that it was improper character evidence but objected only on the basis of relevancy issue was not preserved for reviewrecognizing that a defendant may not raise one ground for objection at trial and argue a different ground on appealholding to preserve an issue for appellate review the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon by trial court and a party may not argue one ground for objection at trial and another ground on appealholding an issue not preserved when one ground is raised to the trial court and another ground is raised on appeal & \n\nthe court may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1). However, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ. P. 72(b), \u201c[ajbsent objection by the plaintiffs, the district court had a right to assume that plaintiffs agreed to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation.\u201d Templeman v. Chris Craft Corp., 770 F.2d 245, 247 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1021, 106 S.Ct. 571, 88 L.Ed.2d 556 (1985). Moreover, \u201c[Failure to raise objections to the Report and Recommendation waives that party\u2019s right to review in the district court and those claims not preserved by such objection are precluded on appeal.\u201d Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 30-31 (1st Cir.1992). See also Henley Drilling Co. v. McGee, 36 F.3d 143, 150-151 (1st Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>); Lewry v. Town of Standish, 984 F.2d 25, 27 holding that failure to object timely to a magistrates report operates as a waiver of any further judicial review of the magistrates decisionholding that objections are required to challenge magistrate judges findings as well as magistrates failure to make additional findingsholding an argument waived on appeal for failure to raise the issue in objection to the magistrates recommendationholding that errors of law in a magistrates findings and recommendations pursuant to section 636b1b can be challenged on appeal even in the absence of the filing of objections in the district courtholding that objections are required when challenging findings actually set out in magistrates recommendation as well as magistrates failure to make additional findings & \n\nNations with ample notice of its intent to charge her as a habitual offender, and she had a fair opportunity to present any defense to that charge. \u00b615. Moreover, at the March 23, 2014 hearing on the State\u2019s motion to amend the indictment to charge her as a habitual offender, Nations\u2019s attorney specifically stated: \u2018Tour honor, we don\u2019t have any opposition [to the State\u2019s motion]. It\u2019s either \u2014 she\u2019s habitual or she\u2019s not. I think that we had already talked and she is in that status.\u201d After Nations\u2019s attorney\u2019s statement, the trial judge granted the State\u2019s motion. It is difficult to imagine a clearer waiver of the issue. Thus, Nations\u2019s claim of unfair surprise is not only without merit but also procedurally barred. Newberry v. State, 85 So.3d 884, 888 (\u00b6 8) (Miss.Ct.App.2011) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we find no error in the trial holding that a noticebased objection to a motion to amend an indictment to charge the defendant as a habitual offender is waived if the defendant fails to make a specific and contemporaneous objectionholding that an objection was adequate when the judge cut short the objection and the defendant was not afforded the opportunity to explain his objection fullyholding a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate reviewholding that a party fails to preserve an evidentiary issue for appeal not only by failing to make a specific objection but also by making the wrong specific objectionholding that defendant waived his objection to the prosecutors use of her peremptory challenges by failing to make a contemporaneous objection during jury selection & \n\nrequirements. Further, upon review of the record, we find no objection by appellant to the trial court\u2019s response to the jury question. Appellant stated that he was satisfied with the judge\u2019s instruction. See N.T., 9\/22\/99, at 131-32. Under Pa. R.A.P. 302(a), \u201c[i]ssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Edmondson, 553 Pa. 160, 718 A.2d 751, 753 (1998); Commonwealth v. Dennis, 548 Pa. 116, 695 A.2d 409, 411 (1997) (\u201c[I]f appellate courts were to consider issues not raised in the trial court, then the trial would become a dress rehearsal ....\u201d) (citing Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Company, 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114, 116 (1974)); Commonwealth v. Jones, 248 Pa.Super. 214, 375 A.2d 63, 65-66 (1977) (<HOLDING>). Because appellant did not preserve the issue holding that the failure to object to a trial courts instruction constitutes waiverholding that plaintiffs failure to object to the improper comments of defendant during closing arguments resulted in waiver of plaintiffs right to argue the issue on appeal because the trial court was not given an opportunity to rule on the issueholding that the failure to object to an instruction constitutes a waiver of errorholding that failure to object to trial courts refusal of further instruction to jury during deliberation results in waiver of issue on appealholding failure to object in timely fashion at trial results in waiver of issue for appeal & \n\nalso claims that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument concerning his prior convictions. According to defendant, the State\u2019s comment was improper in that it called attention to the fact that his prior convictions were of the same crime with which he was charged here. Defendant waived this argument. In order to preserve an error for review, a defendant must both object to the alleged error at trial and renew the objection in his written posttrial motion. People v. Hunter, 331 Ill. App. 3d 1017, 1029 (2002); People v. Bennett, 304 Ill. App. 3d 69, 71 (1999). In this case, defendant failed to preserve this error for review because he did not object to the State\u2019s comment at the time it was made and he abandoned his posttrial motions. See Land, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 256 (<HOLDING>). Defendant claims that any failure to object holding that failure to file a postjudgment motion on alleged error of law relating to ruling on exception to the statute of frauds that was committed for first time in the judgment waives any objection to that ruling and that in the absence of any other formal objection the issue is not preserved for appellate reviewholding issues not raised to and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate reviewholding that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment the trial court is limited to the grounds raised in the motionholding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the failure to obtain a ruling on a motion for new trial waives the issues raised for appellate review & \n\n496, 745 P.2d 717, 721 (Ct.App. 1987). In this case, Plaintiff filed a pretrial motion to exclude the assailant from being considered a concurrent tortfeasor. The motion cited Lujan v. Healthsouth Rehabilitation Gorp., 120 N.M. 422, 902 P.2d 1025 (1995), the same authority Plaintiff relies on in this appeal. Plaintiff thus fairly invoked a ruling of the trial court on this issue and preserved it for appeal. See id. (explaining liabilities of concurrent and successive tortfeasors). {36} We are unpersuaded by Defendants\u2019 argument that Plaintiff failed to preserve this issue by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s jury instructions on comparative negligence. In so contending, Defendants rely on Pittard v. Four Seasons Motor Inn, Inc., 101 N.M. 723, 729, 688 P.2d 333, 339 (Ct.App.1984) (<HOLDING>), and Romero v. Mervyn\u2019s, 109 N.M. 249, 253 n. holding that a party waived an allegation that an instruction was erroneous where the party failed to object at trial to the instruction on those groundsholding that party waived an objection to choice of lawholding defendant waived complaintholding that party waived public policy challenge by failing to raise it during arbitrationholding that party waived complaint regarding instruction where it did not raise specific objection & \n\nPlaintiff, need not specifically reference the FMLA when requesting FMLA leave, she must put the University on notice that her request is for FMLA leave. The undersigned finds that Plaintiff did not request FMLA leave in her letter dated March 21,' 2011, but only suggested that she might need to take leave. The purpose .of the letter was to request an extension of her review which Plaintiff was previously advised could be denied. Based on the undisputed facts of the record, no FMLA violation has been demonstrated, and certainly, no willful or reckless violation of the FMLA is presented. As such, summary judgment should be granted on Count V as well using either of the dates that Plaintiff submits. III. RECOMMENDATION Based on the foregoing, the undersigned recommends t (11th Cir. 2013) (<HOLDING>). RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED at Fort Lauderdale, holding that the failure to object to the magistrate judges report releases the court from its duty to independently review the motionholding that under current eleventh circuit rule the failure to object limits the scope of our appellate review to plain error review of the magistrate judges factual findings however failure to object to the magistrate judges legal conclusions does not preclude the party from challenging those conclusions on appealholding failure to timely object to magistrate judges recommendation waives appellate review of factual and legal questionsholding that under the firm waiver rule a party who fails to make a timely objection to the magistrate judges findings and recommendations waives appellate review of both factual and legal questionsholding that failure to object to magistrate judges recommendation waived issue on appeal & \n\nprotest jurisdiction into pre-procurement decisions. As plaintiffs characterize in responding to defendant\u2019s criticism of their failure to cite authority for their assertions of OCI violations: \u201c[o]f course there are no cases directly on point; there was no such jurisdiction in this Court or in any other forum prior to this case.\u201d (Pls.\u2019 Resp.\/Reply Def.\u2019s Mot. Dismiss\/Opp\u2019n Pls.\u2019 Mot. J. and Cross-Mot. J. AR 12, ECF No. 88.) No viable lack of good faith and fair dealing has been established by plaintiffs in this matter. D. Waiver Defendant contends plaintiffs\u2019 claimed errors in the \u201cprocuring method\u201d were waived by failing to timely raise them. (Def.\u2019s Mot. Dismiss 3, ECF No. 79.) See Blue & Gold Fleet, L.P. v. United States, 492 F.3d 1308, 1313 (Fed.Cir.2007) (\u201cBlue & Gold Fleet\u201d) (<HOLDING>) Id. Because the protestor was aware that the holding that plain error review applies where the defendant fails to object to the lack of an opportunity to allocuteholding that plain error review applies when a party fails to raise a claim before the district courtholding protestor waived its right to challenge a solicitation amendment by not objecting to its terms during the bidding processholding that a defendant who fails to raise a specific issue as the basis for suppression in a motion to suppress to the district court has waived the right to raise that issue on appealholding that a party who has the opportunity to object to the terms of a government solicitation containing a patent error and fails to do so prior to the close of the bidding process waives its ability to raise the same objection subsequently in a bid protest action in the court of federal claims & \n\nJJ., concur. 1 . On appeal, Amquip argues the trial court also erred in denying: its motion for summary judgment, the admission into evidence of depositions, and its motion for a continuance. 2 . Amquip contends on appeal that the trial court erred in denying its request to admit deposition transcripts into evidence and in denying its motion for continuance when it was unable to get the deposition transcripts into evidence. As mentioned previously, those issues are moot because this case is reversed on the denial of the right to a trial by jury. 3 . Although Vercon contends Amquip waived its right to a jury trial by participating in a nonjury trial, this argument relates to whether Amquip preserved the issue for appeal. See Crespo v. Crespo, 28 So.3d 125, 128 (Fla. 4th DCA 2010) holding that for error to be preserved on appeal with regard to admission of evidence in violation of a ruling on a motion in limine that the evidence is inadmissible an objection should be made at the time the evidence is offeredholding defendant failed to preserve for appeal the question of admissibility of evidence that was the subject of the motion in limine where defendant failed to object to evidence when offered at trialholding that a claim was not preserved for review where the defense failed to object on the specific grounds advanced on appealholding that the defendant waived the issue on appeal when he failed to contemporaneously object to the admission of such evidence at trialholding exwifes claim regarding admission of parol evidence was not preserved for appeal because she failed to object to the evidence or to having an evidentiary hearing & \n\nthe moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the court must view the evidence and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986). The judge is not to \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). A genuine issue for trial exists only when there is sufficient \u201cevidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\u201d Id. at 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505. B. Brentwood has not waived its 2 S.Ct. 775, 31 L.Ed.2d 124 (1972) (<HOLDING>); K.M.C. Co. v. Irving Trust Co., 757 F.2d 752, holding a judgment in the absence of notice violates due process rightsholding that there is no due process right to appellate reviewholding that a cognovit clause which provided for judgment without notice or hearing was not unconstitutional per se because due process rights are subject to waiverholding that where there is no unequal bargaining power or overreaching debtors can voluntarily intelligently and knowingly waive due process rights by signing a cognovit note which is an agreement by which a debtor consents in advance to a holders obtaining a judgment without notice or hearingholding that an individual can waive any process to which he or she has a right & \n\nuntil amended motion for new trial); Short v. State, 995 S.W.2d 948, 953 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1999, pet. ref'd)(failure to raise in pari materia claim before trial waives the complaint for appellate review); Haywood v. State, 344 S.W.3d 454, 465 n. 2 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2011, pet. ref'd)(same). M.L.M. would not have had any occasion to raise this issue before, or even during the adjudication hearing, as there was no suggestion that the State was asking for a finding under a lesser included offense. But the bifurcated nature of the juvenile proceedings provided M.L.M. the opportunity to object to the referee\u2019s finding on the lesser included offense before or dur ing the disposition hearing held sixteen days later. See In re A.C., 48 S.W.3d 899, 905 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 2001, pet. denied)(<HOLDING>). By that time, it was clear the referee had holding that defendant waived ineffective assistance claim based on trial counsels failure to emphasize certain evidence where amended motion for new trial did not assert claim of ineffectiveness on that ground and no argument related to the asserted ground was made at the motion for new trial hearingholding that claims raised by appellant for first time in motion for new trial were untimely and therefore waivedholding that the trial court properly struck the amended complaint when the plaintiff offered no reason to refute the trial courts finding that the new allegations in the amended complaint were based on facts the plaintiff had known since the beginning of the actionholding appellants issue was rendered moot because appellant was given the opportunity to make a record in support of his motion for new trial and appellate court considered that record in disposing of only issue raised in the motion for new trialholding complaint made first in amended motion for new trial when juvenile had notice of the issue before trial and during both phases was untimely & \n\nthe Board ... shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.\u201d). Given that none of the Board precedents discussing the impact of a public-to-private change on the issue of successorship addresses the right-to-strike point, there was no reason for the Board to suspect that this was the objection Dean was raising. Dean\u2019s general reference to the different statutory schemes was therefore insufficient to put the Board on \u201c \u2018adequate notice\u2019 of the argument [the company now] seeks to advance on review,\u201d and we are barred from considering it. Highlands Hosp. Corp., Inc. v. NLRB, 508 F.3d 28, 33 (D.C.Cir.2007) (quoting American Postal Workers Union v. NLRB, 370 F.3d 25, 28 (D.C.Cir.2004)); cf. id. (<HOLDING>). Ill Dean also maintains that the unit of holding that notice of judgment was insufficientholding that the denial of petitioners appeal to the bia would have put a reasonable person in the petitioners position on notice that something was wrong with his attorneys preparation for the removal hearingholding that a petitioners generalized reference to the excessive breadth of a remedy with multiple parts was insufficient to put the board on notice that the petitioner was challenging the adequacy of the justification for an affirmative bargaining orderholding that petitioners reliance on a case which concluded that a defendants right to a fair trial was violated was insufficient to place court on notice that petitioner was advancing a constitutional due process claim because the decision was based on state lawholding that generalized notice of copyright infringements was insufficient to establish knowledge for the purpose of contributory liability & \n\nhave changed the jury\u2019s decision to impose a death sentence. See Gissendaner, 272 Ga. at 713-714 (10) (b) (reviewing alleged impropriety that was not objected to at trial solely for the purpose of determining if a death sentence was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor in violation of OCGA \u00a7 17-10-35 (c) (D). 9. In addition to his claim above regarding unsworn and allegedly false testimony, Martin argues that the trial court erred by permitting victim impact testimony that was improper in other ways. Because Martin failed to both raise objections and obtain rulings on them regarding any of the allegedly objectionable statements, he has forfeited his right to appeal under ordinary appellate review standards. See Smith, 287 Ga. at 30 (3) (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, we conclude under the \u201cplain holding that appellants failure to obtain a ruling at the trial level even on a constitutional issue precluded review on appealholding that the supreme court will not address an argument on appeal if a party has failed to obtain a ruling belowholding that a party may not raise a claim on appeal that was not presented to the trial courtholding that a party must obtain a distinct ruling on an issue in order to raise it on appealholding that a party may not raise an issue for the first time on appeal & \n\nwith complete waiver as the penalty imposed for any untimely filed claims. Rule 24.035(b), (g); Dorris v. State, 360 S.W.3d 260, 268 (Mo. banc 2012) (\u201cBy failing to timely file, the movant has completely waived his right to proceed on his post-conviction relief claims.\u201d). Finally, Rule 24.035 restricts the authorized scope o.f appellate review \u201cto a determination of whether the findings and conclusions of the trial court are clearly erroneous.\u201d Rule 24.035(k); see also Dobbins v. State, 187 S.W.3d 865, 866 (Mo. banc 2006). These Rules combine to prohibit appellate review of any claim of ineffective assistance of counsel that is not timely raised in a Rule 24.035 motion.

The District Court reserved decision. Because Jacob failed to renew his motion within ten days of the entry of final judgment, as is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b); Williams v. Guzzardi, 875 F.2d 46, 50 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989). In his reply brief, Jacob argues that even if he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law, we should nonetheless review his sufficiency of the evidence argument and, if we find that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, grant a new trial. Id. (<HOLDING>). But cf. Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d holding that even when a defendant moves under rule 50 at the close of plaintiffs evidence and autocentro did not even do that if a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the posttrial stage with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidenceholding that defendants failure to renew their motion for judgment as a matter of law which was denied by the district court when they made it at the close of the evidence limited the relief the appellate court could grant to a new trialholding in a capital case that the defendant waived his argument that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue where the trial court took the motion under advisement but the defendant failed to seek a ruling on the motion and failed to renew the motion after the jurors had been qualifiedholding that the defendants insufficientevidence claim was barred by his failure to renew his rule 29 motion at the close of all the evidence because there was no manifest miscarriage of justiceholding that an appellate court should not undertake to review whether a plaintiff failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted when the only motion filed and the only motion on appeal was the trial courts grant of summary judgment & \n\nSee also United States v.

As to Piceo\u2019s claim that GE breached the 1994 settlement agreement by relocating his position, the district court said that Picco was bound by the settlement agreement to arbitrate that claim.

Unlike Section 10(a)(4) of the FAA, which states that an award may be vacated \u201cwhere the arbitrators exceeded their powers,\u201d Article V(l)(c) is not so broad; rather, Article V(l)(c) authorizes the Court to deny confirmation of an award if \u201c[t]he award deals with a difference not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration, or it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.\u201d See also Parsons & Whittemore Overseas Co. v.

Here, Henderson strayed beyond the issues submitted by the NFLPA and in doing so exceeded his authority. As a result, vacatur is warranted on this basis as well. Because the court finds that the arbitration award must be vacated on the grounds set forth above, it need not decide whether Henderson was evidently partial or whether the award violates fundamental fairness. The court will remand the matter for further proceedings before the arbitrator as permitted by the CBA. See U.S. Postal Serv. v. Am. Postal Workers Union, AFL-CIO, 907 F.Supp.2d 986, 995 (D.Minn.2012) (<HOLDING>). CONCLUSION Accordingly, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED holding that remand is appropriate in part where the court determines that further evidence is necessary to develop the facts of the case fullyholding that vacatur of predicate conviction was fact necessary for filing 2255 motion based on such vacaturholding that the appropriate remedy on vacatur is to remand the case for further arbitration proceedings consistent with the cbaholding that remand is the appropriate remedy where inter alia the board has incorrectly applied the lawholding that the district courts decision whether to remand for further proceedings or payment of benefits is discretionary and is subject to review for abuse of discretion & \n\nto it, Massachusetts law does not provide for prejudgment interest to be included in uninsured motorist arbitration awards. However, as mentioned above, we have specifically held that arbitrators have the authority to award prejudgment interest in excess of policy limits and \u201cthat; arbitrators should add prejudgment interest to their awards unless the parties specifically provide otherwise by agreement.\u201d Sentry, 556 A.2d at 1000 (quoting Paola, 461 A.2d at 937) (emphasis added). Thus, we hold that defendant\u2019s argument that the arbitrator- awarded on a matter not submitted to him has no merit. Furthermore, we hold that any argument that defendant makes pursuant to the application of Massachusetts law was waived because it was not submitted to the arbitrator. See Aponik, 844 A.2d at 706 (<HOLDING>).

Like an award made pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent power, an award under \u00a7 1927 is proper when the attorney\u2019s actions are so plainly without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose. See, e.g., Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d 1265, 1273 (2d Cir.1986) (police photographs of client taken an hour after incident in which police officers allegedly employed excessive force in taking client into custody did not constitute such clear evidence of absence of excessive force to render client\u2019s attorney liable for his adversary\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a result of bad faith); Acevedo v.

However, this court can properly consider whether the arbitration proceedings improperly precluded Hoffman from discovering or presenting the pertinent evidence that would have impeached the truthfulness of the Cargill employees\u2019 testimony, pursuant to either 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(3) or the extra-statutory \u201cfundamental unfairness\u201d standard. See P & P Indus., Inc., 179 F.3d at 870 (<HOLDING>). The preceding five challenges were recognizing review for fundamental unfairness as an independent extrastatutory groundrecognizing plain or fundamental errorholding right to be fundamentalrecognizing such a ground for judicial review of arbitration awards in this circuitholding that section 34810 is an adequate and independent state ground & \n\nthe burden to seek review, on which the employee evidently acted on a writ of certiorari. Respondent suggests that the parties in this case should have similar powers and burdens. But the circumstances here are much different from those in Boe, which had continued effect when the employer refuses to submit a matter for independent review. Although respondent expressly declared to the employee that it was \u201creserving\u201d the issue of jurisdiction for determination, it chose nevertheless to join with the employee in submitting the grievance question for independent review. Under these circum stances, in spite of its assertion of reserved powers, the county elected the process for determining the dispute. See Helmerichs v.

Perez, 792 F.3d 554, 560 (5th Cir. 2015). To the extent that the award is based merely on repeated filings, it is unclear that a court\u2019s inherent powers can do the same work as Rule 41(d), which is necessarily backward-looking. Rule 41(d) concerns the award of costs from a previous action. In contrast, a court's inherent power gives it the \"authority to impose sanctions in order to control the litigation before it.\" Positive Software Sols., Inc. v. New Century Mortg.

We agree with the Court of Appeals that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that punitive damages are not available under the Act, and we emphasize that the trial court should have made clear to the jury that it could not award punitive damages based upon a violation of the Consumer Protection Act. The trial court\u2019s omission certainly leaves open the possibility that the jury wrongly awarded punitive damages in conjunction with the Consumer Protection Act rather than in connection with a common law claim for recovery. Although we cannot assume that the jury understood the relevant law, since it was not properly instructed, we decline to assume the inverse, as did the Court of Appeals, that the jury found only a violation of the .C.App. 237, 446 S.E.2d 100, 105 (1994) (<HOLDING>). Some courts merely state that the higher holding that where a plaintiff is entitled to treble damages under its state unfair trade practices act and to punitive damages under common law claims of fraud trial court should have submitted each theory of recovery to the jury and then allowed plaintiff to elect between the awards with duplicative elementsholding that even if the trial court had erred in denying the defendants motion for a directed verdict on punitive damages the error was harmless because the jury found in favor of the defendant and never reached the punitive damages claimsholding that the trial court erred by denying plaintiffs request to instruct the jury on all its claims and to submit a special verdict form and by instead requiring the plaintiff to elect between its statutory antitrust claim and its common law tort claims to be submitted to the juryholding that trial court erred by requiring plaintiff to select which remedy to submit to the jury because plaintiff was allowed to elect its remedy between punitive damages and statutory treble after the jurys verdict on all claims was renderedholding that a plaintiff is entitled to either statutory treble damages or punitive damages whichever is the greater & \n\nexists and, if so, (2) whether the specific dispute falls within the scope of that agreement.

We affirm the amended final judgment with the following exception. The Former Wife raises several arguments regarding the propriety of the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs. We dismiss for lack of jurisdiction her challenge to the award because, not only is the amended final judgment ambiguous regarding entitlement, the trial court reserved jurisdiction to determine the amount of fees to be awarded. Because the amount has not been determined, that portion of the amended final judgment is nonfinal and nonappealable. See McIlveen v. McIlveen, 644 So.2d 612, 612 (Fla. 2d DCA 1994) (<HOLDING>); see also Zuberer v.

Thus, to the extent the arbitrator evaluated a slim record, it was a record starved by Kalyanaram, not by any inadequacy of the arbitration process. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. 1 . Kalyanaram\u2019s suit claimed that NYIT submitted fraudulent information to federal and state agencies so that the school\u2019s students would be eligible for subsidized student loans. His claims were brought under the federal False Claims Act and its New York state equivalent. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729, N.Y. State Fin. Law \u00a7 189. 2 . Even if the arbitration award had not yet been confirmed by state courts, it could still have preclusive effect. See Jacobson v. Fireman's Fund Ins.

Accordingly, Durham\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees is denied. VII. Conclusion 98. On Plaintiffs claims under \u00a7 113(f)(1) of CERCLA, the Court awards Plaintiff, The Durham Manufacturing Company, $116,075.65 against Defendant Merriam Manufacturing Company, and $19,345.94 against Defendant Allan E. Adams, plus post-judgment interest. 99. The Court further awards Plaintiff pre-judgment interest, accruing from the latter of the date on which Plaintiff made demand for payment on the Defendants or the date of the expenditure. See Goodrich Corp., 311 F.3d at 177 (<HOLDING>). The Plaintiff is directed to submit a holding that prejudgment interest may include compound interestholding that award and rate of prejudgment interest are within trial courts discretionholding that an award of prejudgment interest under 113f of cercla is mandatoryholding that the state circuit court did not have the authority to award prejudgment interest for matters occurring prior to arbitration awardholding summary rejection of request for interest was not an abuse of discretion under indcode 345147 which states the court may award prejudgment interest as part of a judgment & \n\nof 1996, the time of the enactment of the legislation. See supra. In any event, under this Court\u2019s holding that attorney fee awards are payable to the attorney, not the plaintiff, the awards are the property of the attorney and therefore not subject to offset for the plaintiffs debts. See Marr\u00e9, 117 F.3d at 304 (finding that \u201cthe government cannot set off [the plaintiffs] tax obligations against the attorneys\u2019 fee award, as no mutuality of debt exists between the government and [the plaintiffs] attorneys\u201d). Plaintiff\u2019s Counsel Is Entitled to an Additional Fee Award This Court further finds that the plaintiffs attorney is entitled to an additional fee award under the EAJA for his time spent litigating this issue. See Commissioner, 496 U.S. 154 at 160-161, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (<HOLDING>). The Government recognizes that this Court has holding that the fee applicant bears the burden of showing that an adjustment is necessary to the determination of a reasonable fee holding that eaja fees may be awarded for fee litigation without a separate finding that the government was not substantially justified in its position as to the fee litigation as the single finding that the governments position lacks substantial justification operates as a onetime threshold for fee eligibility and presumptively encompasses all aspects of the civil actionholding that where a contract for legal services fails to expressly provide for the amount of the fee a reasonable fee is impliedholding that awarded fees were reasonable and that proof that attorneys fees are necessary apart from testimony as to the reasonableness of the fee is not requiredholding that the termination of the fee cap did not affect litigation in progress when the fee cap was in effect & \n\nagreement\u201d that \u201cachieved [plaintiffs] objective of obtaining injunctive relief to make [defendant\u2019s hotel] accessible\u201d). This is because a \u201cprevailing plaintiff ... should ordinarily recover an attorney\u2019s fee unless special circumstances would render such an award unjust.\u201d Barrios, 277 F.3d at 1134 (9th Cir.2002). The Ninth Circuit has held that an ADA plaintiff is a prevailing party if she: (1) \u201cachieve[s] a material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties\u201d; and (2) that alteration is \u201cjudicially sanctioned.\u201d Jankey v. Poop Deck, 537 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir.2008). The second requirement can be met in many ways, including when a party enters into a legally enforceable agreement with the defendant. Barrios v. California Interscholastic Fed\u2019n, 277 F.3d 1128, 1134 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); Carbonell v. I.N.S., 429 F.3d 894, 899 (9th holding that plaintiff was not the prevailing party for purposes of awarding attorneys fees even where the court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement because there was insufficient judicial sanctioning of the alteration of the parties legal relationshipholding that the district court abused its discretion by telling the jury about the right of a prevailing plaintiff to attorney fees under 42 usc 1988holding that plaintiff was prevailing party under 42 usc 12205 because he could enforce a settlement against the defendantholding that a defendant is the prevailing party within the meaning of statutory provisions awarding attorneys fees to the prevailing party even when the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the actionholding that the party prevailing on the significant issues in the litigation is the party that should be considered the prevailing party for attorneys fees & \n\nof the claim.\u201d Here the court has tacked on fees for litigating the issue of presuit noncompliance, as well as for litigating the amount of fees to be awarded. Under the plain text of the statute, however, the liability is only for the narrow purpose specified and therefore the amount awarded should have been limited to those incurred \u201cduring the investigation and evaluation.\u201d See Kukral v. Mekras, 679 So.2d 278, 281 (Fla.1996) (\u201cThese provisions for sanctions focus on the presuit period during \u2018the investigation and evaluation of the claim\u2019 and apparently contemplate the imposition of sanctions for the expense and effort that one party may have unnecessarily caused the other to incur during that presuit period.\u201d); see also State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Palma, 629 So.2d 830 (Fla.1993) (<HOLDING>). We therefore reverse the award and remand for holding that higher rate would not be awarded for supplemental fees because there was no showing that any special factor justifies an increased rate for litigating the attorney fees motionholding that court of appeals erred by rendering judgment for full amount of attorneys fees sought after reversing 0 fee award because jury awarded less in damages than amount sought and therefore uncontroverted attorney testimony on amount of attorneys fees did not establish amount of reasonable and necessary fees as a matter of lawholding that fees may be awarded for litigating amount of fees only where language of statute supports such conclusionholding that such fees are discretionary but routinely awardedholding that where a state statute provides for the award of attorneys fees those fees can be considered as part of the amount in controversy for the purpose of determining federal diversity jurisdiction & \n\n"}

However, if the entity is deemed an 'arm of the state' based on factors like control by the state, funding by the state treasury, and performance of state functions, immunity may apply.","COMBINED_RETRIEVED_DOCS":"L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (\u201cThe bar of the Eleventh Amendment to suit in Federal courts extends to States and state officials in appropriate circumstances ... but does not extend to counties and similar municipal corporations.\u201d). The only Eleventh Amendment question here is whether the Holmes County Court, which is responsible for the policies of its Clerk\u2019s Office and Judge Irving, should be considered an \u201carm of the state\u201d and thus vested with sovereign immunity. We do not write on a blank slate. Several years ago, we held that an Ohio court of common pleas was an arm of the state for Eleventh Amendment purposes. See Mumford v. Basinski, 105 F.3d 264, 268 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 914, 118 S.Ct. 298, 139 L.Ed.2d 229 (1997); see also Foster v. Walsh, 864 F.2d 416, 418 (6th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>). This case is factually very similar to holding that because a county is not a person for purposes of a section 1983 claim it cannot be sued where the remedy sought is monetary damagesholding that a state is not a person within the meaning of 1983holding that a state is not a person under 42 usc 1983holding state university is not a person under 1983holding that an ohio municipal court could not be sued under 1983 because it was not a person as 1983 uses that term & \n\ntacitly approved the policy. Accordingly, I will allow the action to proceed against Stanley in his individual capacity. 4. Official Capacity Suits Barrett has sued the defendants in their official capacities. It is well-settled that the Eleventh Amendment bars suits against state entities and state agents working in their official capacities unless the state has expressly waived immunity, which has not been done by New Hampshire for actions brought under \u00a7 1983. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993) (absent waiver, neither a State nor agencies acting under its control may be subject to suit in federal court); Will v.

Guzman v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., 679 F.3d 425, 429 (6th Cir.2012). Sefa\u2019s claims against the Cabinet are barred by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Eleventh Amendment \u201cbars all suits, whether for injunctive, declaratory or monetary relief, against the state and its departments.\u201d Thiokol Corp. v. Dep\u2019t of Treasury, State of Mich., Revenue Div., 987 F.2d 376, 381 (6th Cir.1993). Because Kentucky has not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and Congress has not abrogated state sovereign immunity under sections 1981 and 1983 or any other federal statute cited by Sefa, his claims against the Cabinet cannot proceed. See Hafford v. Seidner, 183 F.3d 506, 512 (6th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); Whittington v. Milby, 928 F.2d 188, 193-94 holding california school district a state agency for purposes of the eleventh amendmentholding that the eleventh amendment applies in 1981 litigationholding that the department of corrections was entitled to eleventh amendment immunity from suit under section 1981holding that the eleventh amendment bars blyshrl and nychrl claims against a state agency in federal courtrecognizing that section 1981 claims against a state agency are barred by the eleventh amendment & \n\na defense to the claims asserted. It is a \"constitutional principle\u201d that \"limit[s] the federal courts\u2019 jurisdiction under Article III,\u201d Seminole Tribe v. Fla., 517 U.S. 44, 64, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996), therefore the Court considers Defendants' Motion to Dismiss on the basis of sovereign immunity as attacking subject matter jurisdiction. 9 . FMC v. S.C. State Ports Auth., 535 U.S. 743, 753-54, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002) (explaining that \"the Eleventh Amendment does not define the scope of the States' sovereign immunity; it is but one particular exemplification of that immunity .... the sovereign immunity enjoyed by the States extends beyond the literal text of the Eleventh Amendment.\u201d); see also Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 504, 33 L.Ed. 842 (1890) (<HOLDING>). 10 . This suit primarily seeks declaratory holding that sovereign immunity barred a federal question suit against a state brought by one of its own citizens even though the text of the eleventh amendment only addresses suits brought by citizens of another stateholding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that the eleventh amendment protects a state from suit by its own citizensholding state immune from suit brought by its own citizensholding that utah did not waive its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to a suit brought in federal court because state statute provided for exclusive original jurisdiction in its own courts & \n\nBeverages & Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 51, 110 S.Ct. 2238, 110 L.Ed.2d 17 (1990). But despite the constitutional requirement that there be a remedy, the Supreme Court expressly noted in Reich v. Collins, 513 U.S. 106, 115 S.Ct. 547, 130 L.Ed.2d 454 (1994), that \u201cthe sovereign immunity [that] States enjoy in federal court, under the Eleventh Amendment, does generally bar tax refund claims from being brought in that forum.\u201d Id. at 110, 115 S.Ct. 547 (second emphasis added). To ensure that taxpayers possess an avenue for relief, the Court held that state courts must hear suits to recover taxes unlawfully exacted, the \u201csovereign immunity [that] States traditionally enjoy in their own courts notwithstanding.\u201d Id.; cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 740, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (<HOLDING>). Reasoning analogously, we conclude that the holding that in statute authorizing suits against united states limits time period in which such suits may be brought united states retains its sovereign immunity as to any suits brought outside of that time period therefore court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over suit against united states that is barred by statute of limitationsholding that congress has power to subject the states to wage and hour regulationholding that congress did not properly abrogate states eleventh amendment immunity from suits under the patent actholding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that congress cannot subject states to suits in state courts but taking care not to overrule reich & \n\n(Doc. # 1-6 at 2.) Thus, Plaintiff was eligible for unemployment compensation benefits. Plaintiff brought this suit, accusing seven Defendants of eight causes of action\u2014 three claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and five under state law. Plaintiff has since abandoned three of her state law claims; she maintains her claims for violations of the Alabama Constitution (Count IV) and for the tort of misrepresentation (Count VI). IV. DISCUSSION A. The State and its agencies are immune from suit. The Eleventh Amendment bars federal courts from entertaining suits brought against unconsenting states. Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 100, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984); see also Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66-67, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (<HOLDING>). The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against holding that a state university is not a person within the meaning of 1983 and therefore is not subject to suits brought under 1983holding that a state is not a person within the meaning of 1983holding that a police department is not a person within the meaning of section 1983holding state university is not a person under 1983holding that a state is not a person under 42 usc 1983 & \n\nstage of the litigation, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the ultra vires exception to the Eleventh Amendment and, thus, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims as to the individual basis, on this basis, is denied. D. Federal Claims Against Defendants Cuomo, Lippman, Prudenti, Hite, Ahl, Hanrahan, Megna, and DiNapoli in their Individual Capacities Plaintiffs assert \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment against Defendants Cuomo, Lippman, Prudenti, Hite, Ahl, Hanrahan, Megna, and DiNapoli, individually. Suits against state officials in their personal capacity are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, even for actions required by their official duties, Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27-28, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (<HOLDING>); however, such actions may be subject to holding that states and state officials acting in their official capacity are not persons under 1983holding that a state officer sued in his individual capacity may be held personally liable for damages under 42 usc 1983 based upon actions taken in his official capacityholding state of north carolina and state official sued in their official capacity are immune from 1983 and 1985 actions in federal courtholding that eleventh amendment does not bar suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials in their official capacityholding that state officials may be personally liable for actions taken in their official capacity & \n\nits immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one. Although a State\u2019s general waiver of sovereign immunity may subject it to suit in state court, it is not enough to waive the immunity guaranteed by the Eleventh Amendment .... In the absence of an unequivocal waiver specifically applicable to federal-court jurisdiction, we decline to find that [a state] has waived its constitutional immunity.\u201d); Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halder-man, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (Powell, J.) (\u201c[A] State\u2019s constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely whether it may be sued, but where it may be sued.\u201d) (emphasis in original); Serrano v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Conservation, 12-CV-1592 (MAD) (CFH), 2013 WL 6816787 (N.D.N.Y. Dec. 20, 2013) (<HOLDING>); Smith v. State Univ. of New York, No. holding that utah did not waive its eleventh amendment immunity with respect to a suit brought in federal court because state statute provided for exclusive original jurisdiction in its own courtsholding that new mexico did not waive eleventh amendment immunity by engaging in activities and entering contracts subject to federal regulationholding that the nyshrl does not waive the new yorks eleventh amendment immunity to suit in federal courtholding that state did not waive eleventh amendment immunity by removing case to federal courtholding that state defendant waived eleventh amendment immunity to a federal claim by removing to federal court & \n\nU.S. 159, 165-66, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3104-05, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985); Will v. Michigan Dept\u2019 of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2312, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989). Section 1983 does not provide for a remedy against the state; such- an action is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. at 165-66, 105 S.Ct. 3099; Will, 491 U.S. at 71, 109 S.Ct. at 2312. Thus, to the extent the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Sheriff Ackal and Deputy Garcia are asserted against these defendants in their official capacities, such claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment and are DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE herein. The Court now turns to the defendants\u2019 defense of qualified immunity in their individuals capacities. See, generally, Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. at 166-67, 105 S.Ct. 3099 (<HOLDING>); Sanders\u2014Burns v. City of Plano, 594 F.3d 366, holding suits against state officials for prospective injunctive relief are permissible because they are in effect suits against the officials in their individual capacitiesholding that government entities may not assert qualified immunityholding that defendants are not entitled to qualified immunityholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitholding officials in their individual capacities may be able to assert personal immunity defenses including qualified immunity that are not available in officialcapacity suits & \n\nthis reasoning is flawed. \u201cYoung does not apply if, although the action is nominally against individual officers, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and the suit in fact is against the state.\u201d Id. at 506. Lucas names no individual officers. The Ex Parte Young exception applies only in actions against individual state officers, and not to state agencies. See id. Therefore, the Ex Parte Young exception to Eleventh Amendment immunity is inapplicable here, thus barring action against the Board. For the foregoing reasons, we will AFFIRM the dismissal of the declaratory judgment by the District Court. 1 . On appeal, Lucas cites two exceptions to the doctrine of Ex Parte Young. See Idaho v. Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribe of Idaho, 521 U.S. 261, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997) (<HOLDING>); Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 holding a suit against an agency of the state is a suit against the stateholding that while the fourteenth amendment is directed against state action and not private action the state action requirement is met in a civil action where state law is applied whether by statute or common lawholding that a damages suit against a state officer in his official capacity was barred because it was functionally a suit against the stateholding that an action cannot be maintained under young in unique circumstances where the suit against the state officer affects an essential attribute of state sovereignty in a manner that the action must be understood as one against the stateholding that an action against an officer was not an action against the state because the relief sought would not take away any property of the state or fasten a lien on it or interfere with the disposition of funds in the treasury & \n\nto include the University of Notre Dame. Criminal statutes are strictly construed; \u201cthey may not be enlarged beyond the fair meaning of the language used.\u201d Pridgeon v. State, 569 N.E.2d 722, 723 (Ind.Ct.App.1991). The fair meaning of the word \u201cschool\u201d does not encompass a college or university. See Lawrence v. Cain, 144 Ind. App. 210, 216, 245 N.E.2d 663, 666 (1969) (stating that \u201cthe word \u2018school\u2019 by common usage, is considered local school corporations and does not generally include higher seats of learning which are usually referred to as colleges or universities.\u201d); see also Pridgeon, 569 N.E.2d at 723 (noting that \u201c[although the word \u2018school\u2019 has numerous meanings, this court excluded colleges and universities from the \u2018common usage\u2019 of this term in Lawrence ....\u201d); cf. id. at 724 (<HOLDING>). We conclude that, within the meaning of our recognizing that property interest based on contractual relationship may arise when a student enrolls in a college or university pays his or her tuition and fees and attends such school holding that the words school property do not include a college or universityholding state university is not a person under 1983holding that the university of maryland law school was a state agencyholding college school district immune from suit in federal court under eleventh amendment & \n\n(1974); see also Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908) (allowing jurisdiction for suits seeking prospective injunctive relief or to protect against continuing violations of federal rights). Moreover, the defendants were properly dismissed from Hogg\u2019s\u2019 suit because New Jersey, its Department of Labor and that Department\u2019s Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation are not recognized as \u201cpersons\u201d under \u00a7 1983. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u201cEvery person who ... causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured ....\u201d) (emphasis added); see also Will v. Mich. Dep\u2019t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (<HOLDING>); United States ex rel. Foreman v. State of holding that neither a state nor its officials acting in their official capacities are persons under 1983holding that states and state officials acting in their official capacity are not persons under 1983holding that neither a state agency nor its officials acting in their official capacities may be sued under section 1983holding that state and its officers sued in their official capacity for damages are not persons suable under 1983holding that the eleventh amendment protects both states and state officials acting in their official capacity from suits brought pursuant to 42 usc 1983 & \n\n460, 463 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cEquitable tolling is proper only when extraordinary circumstances beyond a prisoner\u2019s control make it impossible to file a petition on time.\u201d), petition for cert. filed, \u2014 U.S.L.W. -, \u2014 U.S. -, \u2014 S.Ct. -, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (U.S. June 11, 2001) (No. 00-10520). Because Hatcher filed his habeas petition over two years past the required date for a timely petition, the appeal is untimely and we are barred from reviewing it on the merits. In addition to being untimely, all of the arguments contained in Hatcher\u2019s appeal (except for the District Court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing) have been defaulted by his failure to raise them on direct appeal or in state post-conviction proceedings. See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 729, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991) (<HOLDING>). Hatcher admits that he procedurally defaulted holding that eleventh amendment bars federal suits against state courtsholding that federal courts must defer to independent and adequate state procedural bars in reviewing 2254 petitionsholding that 15a1419a3 is an independent and adequate state ground for a state courts finding of procedural defaultholding that rule 322a is an adequate and independent procedural barholding that in reviewing trial courts ruling on habeas corpus petition reviewing court must defer to all of trial courts implied factual findings supported by record & \n\nboard which carries with it the power of law or authority for enforcement,\u2019 Plaintiffs have failed to present issues which are fit for judicial decision.\" Id. at 13 (citing Underwood v. State, 439 So.2d 125, 128 (Ala.1983)). 31 .The ASB Defendants add that the Eleventh Circuit noted that \"[e]ven when the constitutional minimum has been met, however, prudential considerations may still counsel judicial restraint.\u201d (Doc. 15 at 6-7) (citing Action Alliance, 789 F.2d at 940 n. 12; and, Johnson, 730 F.2d at 648). As such, the ASB Defendants argue that like in Digital, here, the Plaintiffs \"in their haste to preserve their perceived First Amendment rights, rushed prematurely to the courthouse and as a result failed to present ciousness of Atlanta v. Eaves, 601 F.2d 809 (5th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). 35 . See e.g., Zwickler, 394 U.S. 103, 109, holding continuing controversy not mootholding similar agreement void on public policy groundsholding that claims based on grounds not objected to at trial cannot be considered on appealholding appeal moot on this basisholding plaintiffs claims moot on similar grounds & \n\nprong of the Collins [v.

Indeed, some courts have actively cabined Fagan to its facts and held that, generally, plaintiffs may not pursue a municipal .liability claim without any concomitant individual liability. See, e.g., DeNinno v. Municipality of Penn Hills, 269 Fed.Appx. 153, 158 (3d Cir.2008) (\u201cEven more fundamentally, there can be no municipal liability here because we have determined that none of the individual defendants violated the Constitution.\u201d) (citing Grazier, 328 F.3d at 124 n. 5); Cole ex rel.

The district court then stated, however, that \u201c[b]efore there can be any liability under section 1983, there must be \u2018a direct causal link\u2019 between the personal conduct of Deputy Lopez or the municipal conduct of Sonoma County and the alleged constitutional deprivation, in this case the murder of Mar g that \u201cour first inquiry in any case alleging mu nicipal liability under \u00a7 1983 is the question whether there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation\u201d); Kibbe, 480 U.S. at 267, 107 S.Ct. 1114 (stating that \u201cthe Court repeatedly has stressed the need to find a direct causal connection between municipal conduct and the constitutional deprivation\u201d) (O\u2019Connor, J., dissenting); Harris, 664 F.2d at 1125 (<HOLDING>) (footnote omitted). Neither court has used the holding that individuals can be held liable under 1981 only when they have been personally involved or directly participated in the discriminationholding that even a temporary deprivation of first amendment rights constitutes irreparable harmholding that liability under 1983 can be established by showing that the defendants either personally participated in a deprivation of the plaintiffs rights or caused such a deprivation to occurholding that liability under 1983 requires a causal link to and direct responsibility for the deprivation of rightsholding that a superior can be held liable in his individual capacity if he participated in the deprivation of a plaintiffs constitutional rights & \n\nwhich was sovereign immunity. While it is true that where the basis of a dismissal is unclear, the jurisdictional ground controls and thus the dismissal does not preclude a future action, see Remus Joint Venture and Envl.

C (1949), it is not clear that a dismissal based on sovereign immunity is sufficiently jurisdictional for the purposes of claim preclusion. Compare Touvell v.

Trail, 163 So.3d at 276. Although the MHSAA is a private, voluntary association, it is uniquely situated due to its substantial entwinement with government. By statute, the local school boards are empowered to regulate athletic programs. Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 S7-7-301(q). (Rev.2013). But the school-boards have delegated their statutory authority to regulate athletics to the MHSAA. Miss. High Sch. Activities Ass\u2019n. v. Coleman, 631 So.2d 768, 774 (Miss.1994). And because the MHSAA\u2019s authority is derived from statutory authority, its actions are \u201cstate action for the purpose of constitutional analysis.\u201d Id.; see also Brentwood Acad. v. Tenn.

A clear-abuse-of-discretion standard applies to appellate review of stays of adjudication. Angotti, 633 N.W.2d at 556. Here, the district court stayed adjudication based on the fact that respondent would lose his job as a slots manager if a felony conviction were entered. We can understand the district court\u2019s motive, but it is not at all clear that the potential loss of employment is sufficient, by itself, to support a stay of adjudication on a felony. See State v. Twiss, 570 N.W.2d 487, 487 (Minn.1997) (<HOLDING>). Importantly, the record indicates that holding that an adjudication on summary judgment is an adjudication on the meritsholding review of sufficiency of evidence of juvenile adjudication is same as reviewing substantial evidence to support a criminal convictionholding that proof of loss is not evidence of extent of loss and insured is not precluded from showing his damages were greater than shown in proof of lossholding that possibility of loss of employment due to gross misdemeanor conviction was not a special circumstance supporting stay of adjudicationholding that loss of an arm includes loss of the hand & \n\nSee id. at -, 116 S.Ct. at 2047-48. A hypothetical illustrates the efficacy of a unitary standard of review. If a district court were to depart upward based upon physical injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2, p.s., we might conclude that it had abused its discretion if the underlying offense were obstruction of justice, because the guideline applicable to that offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(1), provides for an eight-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved caus[es] ... physical injury to a person.\u201d Our review in such a situation would amount to a de novo review of the applicable guideline to determine whether, as a matter of law, it takes physical injury into account.

After Pendleton gave reasons for the objection, the district court should have determined whether a prima facie case of racial discrimination had been shown. See White, 684 N.W.2d at 505. Instead, the court allowed the state to respond and Pendleton to rebut that response. The court\u2019s analysis was not in accordance with our Batson precedent or the Batson procedure set forth in Minn. R.Crim. P. 26.02, subd. 6a(3). But we have not reversed a district court\u2019s Batson ruling solely because of its failure to follow the prescribed procedure. See Reiners, 664 N.W.2d at 832-34 (<HOLDING>); Taylor, 650 N.W.2d at 202 (\u201cBecause the recognizing that factual findings were clearly erroneous where the record before the court was simply devoid of any basis for the district courts conclusionholding that the district courts finding of no discrimination under title vii was not clearly erroneous because the finding was supported by the recordholding that the district courts finding of no discrimination was not clearly erroneous because the finding was supported by the recordholding that the finding of intent to discriminate is a factual determination subject to the clearly erroneous standard of reviewholding that the district courts application of batson was clearly erroneous but then reviewing the record to make our own determination as to the validity of the objection & \n\nOur decision in Pangle v. Bend-LaPine School District, 169 Or App 376, 10 P3d 275 (2000), rev den, 332 Or 558 (2001), is instructive. In Pangle, the plaintiffs, who sought to challenge a school district\u2019s disciplinary decision, brought two actions, one seeking a writ of review, and the other seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment and related injunctive relief under ORS chapter 28, alleging that the school\u2019s disciplinary decision violated various provisions of the state and federal constitutions. Id. at 379. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for writ of review as untimely, and we affirmed that dismissal. Id. at 383. The trial court also dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims for declaratory and injunctive relief o 435, 963 P2d 149, rev den 328 Or 40 (1998) (<HOLDING>).

This case demonstrates why de no t. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988) (<HOLDING>). It would also be consistent with the standard holding habeas corpus is not a civil action for purposes of the equal access to justice act provision for award of attorney fees to prevailing partyholding abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing determinations of whether a litigants position is substantially justified for purposes of feeshifting under the equal access to justice act although the determination frequently turns on a purely legal issueholding that the standard of review under rule 60 is abuse of discretionholding that the appropriate standard of review is abuse of discretionholding abuse of discretion is the proper standard for reviewing award of attorney fees in patent cases although questions of law may in some cases be relevant & \n\nto establish a necessary element of the crime: the existence of a single scheme involving theft of $5,000 worth of property from the water department. The standard of review for a claim of insufficient evidence is \u201cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d United States v. Ellzey, 874 F.2d 324, 328 (6th Cir.1989) (citing Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). There is ample support for allowing the government to aggregate several acts to establish the $5,000 threshold required for prosecution where the multiple conversions are part of a single scheme. See, e.g., Sanderson, 966 F.2d at 189 (<HOLDING>). The district court instructed the jury in holding that for the government to be sued on a contract pursuant to the tucker act there must be privity of contract between the plaintiff and the united statesholding that when one steals paint and supplies and then orders employees to use such materials in private contract work both actions will be considered components of the larger single fraudulent act of theft from the local governmentholding in a breach of contract action that a state statute established that employees have a right to rely on the layoff and termination procedures advanced by their employers and that to the extent that the government employer considered factors in addition to seniority ability and merit the countys termination of the plaintiffs employment was in violation of the county personnel management actholding that a change in employer from one federal contractor to another caused employees no lack of workholding that orders remanding an action to a federal agency are generally not considered final appealable orders & \n\npublic interest.\u201d Administrative agencies are far better suited than \u00e1re courts to make determinations based on the broad policy question of what is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Third, \u00a7 925(c) contains a restriction on the consideration of new evidence by the district courts, stating; \u201cThe court may in its discretion admit additional evidence where failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d This constraint on the admission of evidence suggests that the initial adjudication of applications is limited to the Secretary of the Treasury. We therefore conclude that Congress in tended for district court review to be contingent on an initial consideration of an application by the Secretary. See Saccacio v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, 211 F.3d 102, 104 (4th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Owen v.

The Virgin Islands Supreme Court relied on two theories in concluding that Kendall\u2019s opinion was a clear and present danger to the fairness of the Ford case. Neither passes muster. According to the Virgin Islands Supreme Court, Kendall\u2019s opinion was punishable because it \u201ccalled the very integrity of [its mandamus] decision into question\u201d by \u201cblatantly accusing], without proof, the Justices ... of gross dereliction of their sworn duties and of committing illegal acts.\u201d Yet Kendall\u2019s criticism of the decision to issue mandamus \u2014 even if it unfairly impugned the Justices\u2019 motives \u2014 is simply not enough. His after-the-fact critique \u201ccould not affect [the Justices\u2019] ability to [fairly] decide\u201d how to rule on the petition for a writ of mandamus. Pennekamp, 328 U.S. at 348 (<HOLDING>). And the Virgin Islands Supreme Court\u2019s holding that criticism of judicial action already taken even though the cases were still pending on other points or might be revived by rehearings was not enough to satisfy the clearandpresentdanger standardholding the dismissed defendant was not precluded from obtaining its reasonable attorney fees under 1317201 even though the action was still pending against another defendantholding that even if the standard for waiver is clear the standard was not metholding that a remand should be limited to cases in which further action must be taken by the district court or in which the appellate court has no way open to it to affirm or reverse the district courts action under reviewholding that reinstatement is prospective even though it contemplated changing the result of an action already taken & \n\n1995, writ denied) (plaintiffs equitable remedy of reinstatement not precluded); and City of Midland v.

For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that claims brought under the Whistle- blower Law are torts subject to the OTCA and that whistleblower remedies are not directly in conflict with the OTCA. Dr. Rabkin\u2019s jury award of $500,000 under the Whistleblower Law must accordingly be remitted to $200,000 as set forth in the OTCA. We therefore reverse the judgment of the district court in the appeal brought by OHSU. We now turn to Dr. Rabkin\u2019s cross-appeal. VI. ,We review a district court\u2019s ruling regarding equitable reinstatement for an abuse of discretion. Gotthardt v. Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp., 191 F.3d 1148, 1156 (9th Cir.1999); see also Cancellier v. Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, 672 F.2d 1312, 1319 (9th Cir.1982) (<HOLDING>). \u201cThe district court abuses its discretion holding that reinstatement in an age discrimination case lies within the discretion of the trial court after careful consideration of the particular facts of the caseholding that whether dismissal or transfer is appropriate lies within the sound discretion of the district courtholding that the weight accorded to evidence lies largely within the discretion of the agencyholding that the decision whether to grant a continuance lies in the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretionholding that the decision whether to grant reconsideration lies largely within the discretion of the trial court & \n\nFor these reasons, we conclude that the Civil Rights Act of 1991 did not render Title VII and \u00a7 1981 the exclusive remedies for public sector employment discrimination, thereby preempting a constitutional cause of action under \u00a7 1983. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Johnson\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims. AFFIRMED. 1 . Count Eight asserts a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985 claim against the individual defendants for alleged conspiracy to violate Johnson's \u00a7 1981 and Thirteenth Amendment rights. This count is not at issue on this appeal. 2 . The defendants also moved to dismiss the ' \u00a7 1981 claim. The district court granted dismissal against the City only, citing Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 733, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 2722, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989)(<HOLDING>). 3 .We review de novo a question of law holding that 1983 does not provide a remedy if there is no violation of federal lawholding that where it is alleged that state has violated rights conferred by constitution governmental immunity is not available in state court action but declining to infer a right to sue the state for damages on the basis of a violation of the michigan constitutionholding that 1983 is the exclusive federal remedy for violation of the rights guaranteed in 1981 by state governmental unitsholding that title vii provides the exclusive judicial remedy for claims of discrimination in federal employmentholding that title vii of the civil rights act of 1964 provides the exclusive remedy for claims of employment discrimination by federal agencies & \n\nother equitable relief, costs, and attorneys fees (Doc. 115) is granted in part and denied in part as follows: plaintiff shall recover from defendant back pay in the amount of $8,063, with prejudgment interest thereon in the amount of $1,363; plaintiffs costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; compensatory damages as found by the jury in the amount of $1,000; pecuniary damages as found by the jury in the amount of $12,000; and punitive damages as found by the jury in the amount of $20,000. 1 . 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. 2 .

In this case, the parties do not dispute holding that once the employee makes its prima facie showing the burden then shifts to the employer to prove that legitimate reasons supported the terminationholding that if the plaintiff makes a prima facie case the defendant employer must then articulate some legitimate nonretaliatory reason for the adverse action and the employee must then have a fair opportunity to show pretext that is that a discriminatory intent motivated the employers actionholding that once an employer asserts a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action it has done everything that would be required if the plaintiff had properly made out a prima facie case so whether the plaintiff really did so is no longer relevantholding in a race discrimination case that close timing is an element of the plaintiffs prima facie case but insufficient on its own to rebut a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason that explains the action and its timingholding that in title vii disparate treatment case in order for a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case the plaintiff must proffer evidence among other things that she performed her job according to her employers legitimate expectations if the plaintiff establishes the prima facie case the presumption shifts the burden to the employer to produce a legitimate nondiseriminatory reason for its actions & \n\nAlthough public policy arguments are not resolved by juries, they require that the court understand what happened to a plaintiff, a question only answered after a. judge has heard evidence detailing the circumstances that resulted in an injury.

To address public policy for the first time at this stage in the litigation deprives the Munns of the opportunity to rebut Hotch-kiss\u2019s version of events.

The civil forfeiture in Plaintiffs\u2019 case was achieved by a consent judgment in judicial proceedings; the civil forfeiture did not involve agency action. By its own terms, \u00a7 702 only applies where the party seeks judicial review of agency action. Because the instant forfeiture took place in the context of a civil judicial proceeding, there is no agency action for the district court or this Court to review. See Comm, of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of Columbia, 28 F.3d 130, 134 (D.C.Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). The APA therefore cannot be the basis for a holding that under the apa exhaustion is a prerequisite to judicial review when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review so long as the administrative action is made inoperative pending that reviewholding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordholding apa 5 usc 702 inapplicable because no agency proceeding took place for the court to reviewholding that the apa does not afford an implied grant of subjectmatter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency actionholding a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands & \n\nto establish its consideration of a legal issue\u201d). Like the Eighth Circuit, we do not believe that a district court errs when it fails \u201cto explain a revocation sentence that is consistent with all applicable policy statements.\u201d United States v. Caves, 73 F.3d 823, 825 (8th Cir.1996). IV. In addition to imposing eleven months confinement, the district court\u2019s revocation order in CR-29 stated that the unpaid portions of Johnson\u2019s fine and reimbursement costs for his court appointed counsel \u201cremain in effect.\u201d Johnson argues that the district court could not reimpose those obligations in the written judgment order revoking Johnson\u2019s supervised release when it failed to reimpose them in open court in the revocation hearing. See United States v. Layman, 116 F.3d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). We find that those obligations existed holding that a sentence imposed for a violation of supervised release will be upheld where 1 the district court considered the applicable policy statements 2 the sentence is within the statutory maximum and 3 the sentence is reasonableholding that sentence is imposed when the district court orally pronounces itholding that a court is free to change an orally pronounced sentence until a written judgment is filedrecognizing constitutional right to be present when sentence is imposedrecognizing that we review the sentence imposed by a district court under the abuse of discretion standard & \n\nwhich rejected the Plan. The Bankruptcy Code does not provide a standard for determining when \u201cunfair discrimination\u201d exists. See 203 N.

The interplay of OCGA \u00a7\u00a7 34-9-11 (a) and 34-9-15 (b), which this Court has not previously addressed, is informed by how we and the Court of Appeals have interpreted the interplay between the exclusive remedy provision and subsection (a) of OCGA\u00a7 34-9-15. (b) It is well established that a settlement under OCGA \u00a7 34-9-15 (a) which requires an employer to compensate its employee for an alleged injury bars a subsequent tort suit by the employee against anyone protected by the exclusive remedy provision, regardless of the actual circumstances of the employee\u2019s injury and the amount of compensation to which the parties agreed.

Because defendants moved for summary judgment only on the question of the employment relationship between plaintiff and defendants, it is not necessary for us to decide the viability of this theory.

Under such a rule, moreover, an employer would apparently be able to avoid liability only by immediately approving every disability-accommodation request that it received, even where there was no reason to believe harm might follow from a brief delay. Defendant, moreover, had no reason to believe that Marks would suffer any imminent harm from a brief negotiation period over the scope of his needed accommodations. Accord Ungerleider v. Fleet Mortg.

This was similarly not a situation where a holding that the disabled individual bears the initial burden of proposing an accommodation and showing that that accommodation is objectively reasonable and that the defendant was entitled to prevail because the plaintiffs proposed accommodation of remaining on unpaid medical leave until another customer service or receptionist position opened up was not a reasonable accommodation under the adaholding that a person must request a reasonable accommodation before he has been terminated he cannot wait until he is terminated and then months later request reinstatement and demand a reasonable accommodationholding that teachers request for four months leave was not a reasonable accommodationholding failure to immediately approve request for accommodation even for employee with known disability did not constitute denial of reasonable accommodation where employer was working on solution over several monthsholding that an employer is not liable where it takes reasonable steps to provide an accommodation and the employee is responsible for a breakdown in the process of identifying a reasonable accommodation & \n\nbe held liable for acts of infringement if that defendant is either contribu-torily or vicariously liable for another\u2019s direct act of infringement. Where those acts of infringement occur within the United States and a plaintiff seeks to hold a foreign defendant contributorily or vicariously liable for those acts, it has been held that subject matter jurisdiction may exist, and that the exercise thereof does not conflict with the doctrine of nonextraterri-toriality.

The School District does not dispute that \u00a7 20.7(3) is applicable to Lockhart, but does contend that Lockhart is nonetheless an at-will employee. Quite surprisingly, no reported Iowa decision has directly addressed the issue of whether \u00a7 20.7(3) negates the presumption of at-will employment for the public employees and employers covered under this provision of the Iowa Public Employment Relations Act. The few cases that have specifically addressed \u00a7 20.7(3) deal with its interaction with other statutory provisions involving discharge of public teachers. See, e.g., Northeast Community Educ.

See Peerless Plywood Co., 107 NLRB 427, 429 (1953); Livingston Shirt Corp., 107 NLRB 400, 409 (1953). Employers may dispatch supervisors to engage in one-on-one discussions during work time with employees about the negative effects of union representation, see, e.g., NLRB v. Lenkurt Elec.

Demonstrably, Monson knew his actions were wrongful and without just cause. Further, Monson\u2019s behavior falls outside of the sort of reckless or unfortunate but non-malicious acts that this Court have previously held do not rise to the standard of a willful and malicious injury under \u00a7 523(a)(6).

Although all three statutes provide that a supervisor is an employer, a number of courts have held that Congress included the phrase \u201cany agent\u201d to make sure that respondeat superior liability was imposed on the employers for the acts committed by their agents, not upon the agents personally. Id. at 50-51. Accordingly, Plaintiffs ADA claims against the Individual Defendants are hereby DISMISSED with prejudice. B. TITLE VII CLAIMS AGAINST INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS The First Circuit has held that there is no individual employee liability under Title VII. Fantini v. Salem State College, 557 F.3d 22 (1st Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>). \u201c \u2019The statutory scheme of Title VII itself holding that the definition of employer for title vii purposes does not encompass individu al supervisors even if such individuals are acting as agents of the employerholding that only employers not individuals acting in their individual capacity who do not otherwise meet the definition of employers can be held liable under title viiholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that title vii does not provide for a damages claim against supervisors or fellow employeesholding individual defendants are not an employer within meaning of title vii & \n\nwill not state a cause of action for retaliatory discharge.\u201d Turner, 233 Ill. 2d at 502-03. The Complaint here fails to state a cause of action. Although attorney honesty and fidelity are vital to the legal system and a matter in the public interest, we do not believe that a former law firm employee can be immune from the general rule of at-will employment merely by complaining to the Firm and its attorneys prior to being fired about deceitful but seemingly legal billing practices he no longer wishes to participate in. While we do not condone the Firm\u2019s alleged misconduct here, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs allegation of \u201chonesty and fidelity\u201d in the legal system satisfies the supreme court\u2019s \u201cnarrow definition of public policy\u201d in retaliatory discharge cases. Id. at 507-08 (<HOLDING>). We affirm the dismissal of the Complaint. holding that based on the narrow scope of a retaliatory discharge action the general concept of patient safety by itself is simply inadequate to justify finding an exception to the general rule of atwill employmentholding that an atwill employee who alleges retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers compensation claim has stated a cause of action under pennsylvania lawrecognizing the tort of retaliatory dischargerecognizing general rulerecognizing narrow whistleblower exception to the atwill doctrine & \n\nas an \u201cagent\u201d of WMATA, is an \u201cemployer\u201d hable under section 2000e-2(a)(l) for discriminating against her on the basis of her sex. While a construction of the statute to impose individual liability on an agent is facially plausible, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u201c[t]he obvious purpose of this agent provision was to incorporate respondeat superior liability into the statute.\u201d Miller v. Maxwell\u2019s Int'l Inc., 991 F.2d 583, 587 (9th Cir.1993) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, while a supervisory employee may be joined as a party defendant in a Title VII action, that employee must be viewed as being sued in his capacity as the agent of the employer, who is alone hable for a violation of Title VII. See Busby v. City of Orlando, 931 F.2d 764, 772 (11th Cir.1991) (<HOLDING>). Considering the evidence in the hght most holding individual defendants are not an employer within meaning of title viiholding that relief granted under title vii is against the employer not individual employees whose actions constituted a violation of title vii emphasis in originalholding that there is no individual liability under title viiholding that individual employees are not liable under title viiholding individual employees may be liable under title vii & \n\nF.3d 65, 69 (1st Cir. 2008) (once initial sanction is final, subsequent sanction would violate industrial double jeopardy principles); Elkouri & Elkouri, How Arbitration Works c. 15.3.F.vii (7th ed. 2012). We do not, however, for the reasons explained below, interpret the award to preclude appropriate remedial action required by statute, including training and coun-selling, to address Ashe\u2019s sexual harassment. General Laws c. 15 IB requires an employer to take some remedial action in cases of confirmed sexual harassment. See College-Town, supra at 162 (employer who is notified of sexual harassment in workplace and fails to take adequate remedial action violates G.

Id. at 532. Our Supreme Court held \u201cthat when changing a group policy insuring contributing employees and obtaining the applications of those employees, the employer acts as an agent of the employees [cits.], and as such is under a duty to notify the employees of differences between the old and new policies and of any rights the employees may have to continue the old insurance on an individual basis. We hold further that where this duty is breached, an employee can recover such damages as result from the difference in coverage.\u201d Id. at 535-536. Although this case is somewhat factually different from Dawes Mining, the same analysis of duty and breach are applicable in this case. When an employee makes application for group health insurance coverage and ) (1981) (<HOLDING>).

Id., 561 F.2d at 165 (citations omitted; emphasis added). In the cases where third party lenders have been held hable under \u00a7 6672, the lender has exercised control over the disbursements of the taxpayer. See Commonwealth National Bank of Dallas v.

Appellant argues that Debtor\u2019s subsequent cooperation in assisting Appellant in collecting the past due taxes is irrelevant to the issue of willfulness. This Court agrees. Willfulness requires only the commission of a \u201cvoluntary, conscious, and intentional act.\u201d Mazo, 591 F.2d at 1154.

Plaintiffs argue that they are not \u201cpersons\u201d because: 1) they did not make the decision to stop paying tax funds or to prefer some creditors over the IRS; and 2) Manley had enough funds free and clear of any control by the bank to have paid the payroll taxes withheld to the United States. The United States argues that under the line of credit loan and security agreement, the bank has the power to control Manley in the event of default, plaintiffs are \u201cpersons.\u201d \u201cPerson\u201d is defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6671(b), as follows: \u201c[t]he term \u2018person\u2019, as used in this subehapter, includes an officer or employee of a corporation, or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, or member is under it, Inc., 956 F.2d 703 (7th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>).

Under the \u201cactual effects\u201d test, it is clear that Washington\u2019s percentage-based penalty provisions are not primarily imposed to compensate the state. The State\u2019s contention that it incurs costs in the collection of unpaid taxes is irrelevant because the provisions\u2019 \u201cactual effect\u201d has no direct relation to any specific costs incurred by the State. Furthermore, as the district court observed, other courts have held that escalating percentage-based penalties imposed in addition to interest are generally punitive rather than compensatory in effect. A The Tenth Circuit and a bankruptcy court in this circuit have concluded that pereent- age-based penalties for unpaid taxes were punitive rather than compensatory. See, e.g., In re Cassidy, 983 F.2d 161, 164-65 (10th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); In re E.A. Nord Company, Inc., 75 B.R. 634, holding that the defendant withheld pension benefits in breach of the planholding that the family courts award to exwife of interest in 387 of debtors military pension payable directly from the plan was not subject to discharge because interest in pension plan was not a debt rather it was considered exwifes separate ownership interestholding that an antiassignment clause in a pension plan is valid under 541c2 and that the pension benefits thus do not become property of the estate and may not be made subject to a pay order under section 1325cholding that irs ten percent assessmentlabelled a taxon premature withdrawal from pension plan funds was nonpecuniary loss penalty and thus not entitled to priority in bankruptcyholding that appropriate remedy was to compute service credit for veterans in accordance with vrra rather than pursuant to employers pension plan and requiring retroactive pension plan payments to be made & \n\n[debtor] significantly increases his income, he would go to his grave either indebted to ECMC or, if not, indebted to the IRS on the tax obligation incurred when ECMC forgives the unpaid loan.\u201d). Second, contrary to the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s reasoning, consideration of the ICRP would not impermissibly diminish the authority of the Bankruptcy Court by precluding discharge based upon undue hardship whenever a debtor is eligible for, but did not participate in, the ICRP. See Bronsdon, 2009 WL 95038, at *4. (citing Denittis, 362 B.R. at 64-65). Applying the Brunner test, three circuit courts of appeals have concluded that eligibility for the ICRP should be considered as a component of the undue hardship analysis but is not necessarily dispositive. In re Mosko, 515 F.3d 319, 326 (4th Cir.2008)(<HOLDING>); In re Alderete, 412 F.3d 1200, 1206 (10th holding that the defendant did not establish good faith as a matter of lawholding that the test for good faith is the actual belief of the party and not the reasonableness of that beliefholding that while the creditor has the initial burden to produce some evidence of lack of good faith the ultimate burden is on the debtor to prove his good faithholding when applying the brunner test that while not a per se indication of a lack of good faith debtors decision not to take advantage of the icrp is probative of her intent to repay the loansholding that seeking out loan consolidation options such as the icrp is an important component of the good faith inquiry under the brunner test & \n\nit did not reach the question of immunity. Given the conclusions we have reached, however, it is necessary for us to do so. Under \u00a7 820.2, a public employee cannot be held liable for any injury resulting from \u201chis act or omission where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of discretion vested in him, whether or not such discretion be abused.\u201d The City correctly asserts that \u00a7 820.2 applies to county social workers engaged in investigating allegations of child abuse, and extends to other public employees whom those social workers \u201creasonably enlist to assist in the investigation.\u201d Newton v. County of Napa, 217 Cal.App.3d 1551, 266 Cal.Rptr. 682, 687 (Cal.App.1990); Alicia T. v. County of Los Angeles, 222 Cal.App.3d 869, 271 Cal.Rptr. 513, 519-20 (Cal.App.1990) (<HOLDING>). This immunity provides complete protection holding failure to exercise discretion is abuse of discretionholding that the workers compensation act is to be liberally construed in the employees favor and any doubt in its construction is thus resolved in favor of the employeeholding that social workers immunity is designed to protect the continu ing exercise of discretion in favor of the protection of minor childrenholding that in its review of the irs exercise of discretion the court is limited to a review of the administrative recordholding that under mayfield the exercise of discretion based on a mistaken premise of law can be a failure to properly exercise discretion & \n\ncompetent, ... a person rendering necessaries or professional services is entitled to recover from such person under the conditions stated in this Section, although the person expresses an unwillingness to accept the things or services. (Emphasis added.) In addition to the principles set forth in the Restatement of Restitution discussed above, cases from other jurisdictions have concluded that a patient is liable for the reasonable value of medical services rendered by a hospital based on an implied in law contract theory. See Nursing Care Servs., 380 So.2d at 518 (concluding that provider of nursing care services was entitled to value of services provided to patient based on emergency aid quasi-contract theory); Galloway v. Methodist Hosps., Inc., 658 N.E.2d 611, 614 (Ind.Ct.App.1995) (<HOLDING>); Heartland Health Sys. v. Chamberlin, 871 recognizing that at least for certain purposes a hospital room is fully under the control of the medical staff yet for other purposes it is the patients room because patient understands that nurses doctors food handlers and others enter and exit hospital room in accordance with medical need and hospital routineholding that trial court abused its discretion in ordering chiropractor to disclose the identity of all patients that had any type of connection to the plaintiffs attorneys and to produce all billing records for services rendered to attorneys or patientsholding that wife made an unambiguous unqualified promise to pay for the hospital services rendered to her husband when she signed a document that was separate from the patients registration form which she did not sign and which listed her husband as the person responsible for this account and when the separate document was entitled guarantee of account and provided i will pay any unpaid balance on dismissal and i agree to be responsible for hospital services rendered to this patientholding that equity demanded that patients pay for medical services rendered by hospital in birth of child to prevent unjust enrichmentholding that claim against hospital regarding patients fall caused by defective footboard on hospital bed constituted health care liability claim & \n\n(1952). The general test to resolve this question employs the following factors: 1) the form and manner of the employment contract concerning provisions of full-time or part-time employment; 2) whether the employment contract provides for vacation time, sick leave, or a retirement program; 3) the extent an nature of control the individual has over the execution of his duties; 4) the form of payment; and 5) the ownership status of equipment which is utilized. Rivera v. Hospital Universitario, 762 F.Supp. at 17. No one factor, by itself, is sufficient to establish an individual as an independent contractor. Id. In fact, it is unusual to find cases where the distinction between an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and an employee is crystal clear. Nazario v. Gonzalez, 101 D.P.R. 569, 572 (1973) (<HOLDING>). In Landr\u00f3n v. Labor Relations Board, 87 holding that depriving an employee of vacation days to which he was entitled would constitute adverse actionholding that an employer is accountable to a discharged employee for unpaid compensation if the employee was terminated in bad faith and the compensation is clearly connected to work already performedholding that vacation pay is shortterm compensation because an employee must work six months before getting any vacation vacation pay was computed on the basis of the employees weekly earnings and if an employee was laid off he received vacation pay on a pro rata basisholding that under the mwa the question of whether an employee was an independent contractor or an employee was a question of statutory interpretationholding that an electrical appliance representative and salesperson was not an independent contractor but an employee and as such was entitled to unpaid compensation for accumulated vacation time & \n\nthose state laws that specifically \u201cregulate insurance.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A). The Supreme Court has recently set forth a new two-part test for determining whether a state law \u201cregulates insurance\u201d and is, therefore, saved from ERISA\u2019s preemptive effect. This two-part test requires the state law to: (1) \u201cbe specifically directed toward entities engaged in insurance\u201d; and (2) \u201csubstantially affect the risk pooling arrangements between the insurer and the insured.\u201d Ky. Ass\u2019n of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, _ U.S. _, 123 S.Ct. 1471, 1479, 155 L.Ed.2d 468 (2003). If this two-part inquiry reveals that the state' law regulates insurance, then the state law is saved from preemption. \u201cThis does not, however, end [the] preemption analysis.\u201d Cono Co., 337 F.3d 1138, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Fink v. Dakotacare, 324 F.3d 685, 689 (8th holding claims under the montana unfair trade practices statute were conflictpreempted because the montana law provided nonerisa damages for essentially claim processing causes of actionholding that an action which seeks nonerisa damages for what are essentially claim processing causes of actionf clearly falls under the 1132 preemption exemplified by pilot lifeholding that state law causes of action arising from improper processing of a claim for benefits are preemptedholding that a complaint that seeks nonerisa damages for what are essentially claim processing causes of action clearly fall within the ambit of 1132 preemption exemplified by pilot lifeholding that state common law causes of action asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits under an employee benefit plan are removable to federal court & \n\npersons affected.\u201d State v. Breed, 111 Idaho 497, 500, 725 P.2d 202, 205 (Ct.App.1986). In any equal protection analysis, the court must: first, identify the classification that is being challenged; second, articulate the standard under which the classification will be tested; and third, determine whether the standard has been satisfied. Id. at 500, 725 P.2d at 205. Accordingly, in order for Rome to prevail, he is required to show that he, by virtue of some classification, was treated differently than a person who does not share that classification, However, I.C. \u00a7 18-1401 does not create a classification. The statute applies to \u201cevery person\u201d who enters a building with the intent to commit any theft or felony. See State v. Hamlin, 156 Idaho 307, 316, 324 P.3d 1006, 1015 (Ct.App.2014) (<HOLDING>). It is true, as Rome points out, that Idaho holding that statute which defined sexual contact as any touching of the anus breast or any part of the genitals of another person with intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person was not vagueholding that a statute applied to any person who sexually abused and exploited a vulnerable adult and did not treat the defendant differently on account of any classificationholding that language in a merrill lynch customer account agreement that the plaintiff signed upon opening the first account providing for arbitration of any controversy arising out of its business applied to the disputed second account even though the plaintiff did not sign a separate customer account agreement for the second accountholding that the plaintiff who alleged he was subjected to discipline and a disciplinary proceeding not applicable to any other police officer under the collective bargaining agreement but not alleging any classbased discrimination failed to state a claim as the plaintiff did not show how he was treated differently from others similarly situated emphasis addedholding with no analysis that any person or organization who may be legally liable therefor applies to a person legally liable for injuries caused by an accident 4 when under the facts of the case the only person to whom the clause could have applied was a tortfeasor & \n\nof a plan...\u201d); \u00a7 1121(b) (\u201c...only the debtor may file a plan until after 120 days after the date of the order for relief\u2019). I find persuasive an additional reason why \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d should be construed to describe eligible transfers rather than to impose a temporal restriction on the transaction itself. As a description, \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d embodies an intent to exclude ordinary course of business and non-debtor transactions from the scope of \u00a7 1146(c). These meanings lie within the definition of \u201cunder\u201d and are necessary to apply the provision. If Congress intended to encourage plan confirmation, it follows that Congress would facilitate the process by providing tax relief for only those transfers necessary for the plan, rather th 124-25 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1995) (<HOLDING>); cf., The Baldwin League of Independent holding that debtors cannot claim an exemption in a homestead after trustee avoided the transfer of the property as a fraudulent conveyance because the transfer by the debtors was voluntaryholding that new yorks notice to judgment debtors satisfied due process by specifying that a procedure existed to adjudicate exemption claims and advising debtors to contact an attorney even though the notice did not inform judgment debtors of the specific steps to be taken to test exemption claimsholding it was irrelevant that irss collection of 100 section 6672 liability against responsible nondebtor debtors principal officer and major shareholder would affect the debtors reorganization although nondebtors financing was necessary for debtors reorganization bankruptcy court had no jurisdiction to enjoin the irs at debtors request on behalf of nondebtorholding that transfers between nondebtor third parties not subject to 1146c exemption even if transfer necessary to finance acquisition of debtors propertyholding that grant or denial of debtors claim of property exemption is final appealable order & \n\nage discrimination, a plaintiff would be required to demonstrate that: (1) he was a member of the protected class [i.e, age-40-and-over]; (2) he was discharged; (3) he was qualified for the position; (4) he was replaced by a younger person.

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements. Given that role, Stern had a duty to disclose any known information necessary to prevent the Official Statements from being false or misleading. See Howard, 228 F.3d at 1061 (<HOLDING>). Allstate has further alleged that Stern holding a defendant may be convicted of mail fraud if he knowingly and willfully participates in a fraudulent scheme created and set in motion by othersholding that no judgment can be rendered against defendant who cannot be held liableholding that a person violates the bank fraud statute when he knowingly executes a scheme to obtain money from a financial institution by means of false or fraudulent representations if a defendant knowingly provided materially false information in order to induce the loan the crime is complete and it is irrelevant whether or not he intended to repay or was capable of repaying itholding that a defendant can be held liable when it knowingly participates in the creation of a false or misleading statementholding that the elements of a claim under 3729a2 are 1 that the defendant made used or caused to be made or used a record or statement to get a claim against the united states paid or approved 2 the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent and 3 the defendant knew that the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent emphasis added & \n\nnoneconomic damage awards. A defendant is liable to a claimant only for the percentage of the damages found by the trier of fact equal to that defendant\u2019s percentage of responsibility unless the percentage of responsibility attributed to the defendant is greater than 50% or the defendant engaged in particular conduct listed in the penal code. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 33.013(a), (b) (West 2008). Here, the jury found LMS 30% responsible and found Hospital 60% responsible. Based on our above holding that legally insufficient evidence exists to support the jury\u2019s joint enterprise finding and the fact that the jury assessed only 30% responsibility against LMS, LMS cannot be jointly and severally liable with Hospital for the entire judgment.

Plaintiffs contend that underwriters do not exercise discretion and independent judgment concerning matters of significance because the underwriters do not bear any responsibility for financial loss and do not determine the financial risk that Huntington will take for any given loan. However, while underwriters do not determine Huntington\u2019s overall risk guidelines, they still make decisions that signifi cantly impact the business and do determine the risk Huntington will accept for any particular loan. Underwriters can approve loans between $250,000 and $1,000,000. Their approval of a loan binds Huntington to that risk, and their denial of an application prevents a customer from acquiring credit. Cf (<HOLDING>).

Under such a rule, moreover, an employer would apparently be able to avoid liability only by immediately approving every disability-accommodation request that it received, even where there was no reason to believe harm might follow from a brief delay. Defendant, moreover, had no reason to believe that Marks would suffer any imminent harm from a brief negotiation period over the scope of his needed accommodations. Accord Ungerleider v. Fleet Mortg. Grp. of Fleet Bank, 329 F.Supp.2d 343, 355 (D. Conn. 2004) (<HOLDING>). This was similarly not a situation where a holding that the disabled individual bears the initial burden of proposing an accommodation and showing that that accommodation is objectively reasonable and that the defendant was entitled to prevail because the plaintiffs proposed accommodation of remaining on unpaid medical leave until another customer service or receptionist position opened up was not a reasonable accommodation under the adaholding that a person must request a reasonable accommodation before he has been terminated he cannot wait until he is terminated and then months later request reinstatement and demand a reasonable accommodationholding that teachers request for four months leave was not a reasonable accommodationholding failure to immediately approve request for accommodation even for employee with known disability did not constitute denial of reasonable accommodation where employer was working on solution over several monthsholding that an employer is not liable where it takes reasonable steps to provide an accommodation and the employee is responsible for a breakdown in the process of identifying a reasonable accommodation & \n\n(1993).

The limited duty rule is an exception to general negligence principles, and more particularly, to the application of the business invitee standard of care in the commercial context. The dissent apparently prefers not to consider public policy and fairness concepts if the result is to hold the owner of the commercial enterprise responsible for its negligence when it does not adequately protect its business invitees, at least outside of the spectator seating areas. But, the Court is required by its common law precedents to examine the owner\u2019s duty in those circumstances, and to consider which of the parties is best able to bear the burden of foreseeable harm within the stadium. See Carter Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v.

Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), prejudice is presumed when (1) the complete denial of counsel occurs at a critical stage, (2) counsel entirely fails to subject the prosecution\u2019s case to meaningful adversarial testing, or (3) circumstances make it unlikely that any lawyer could provide effective assistance, such as severe time constraints or conflicts of interest.","COMBINED_RETRIEVED_DOCS":"United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). Cronic was a companion case-to Strickland; however, in Cronic the question before the Supreme Court was whether counsel\u2019s representation was such that, even without a showing of prejudice, it might be presumed to have occurred. See id at 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Under the analysis developed in Cronic, such would be the case when counsel was absent during a critical stage of the trial. See id. at 659, 104 S.Ct. 2039. Case law has developed to instruct us that a determination of whether the absence of counsel has occurred at a critical stage is dependent upon whether the evidence presented during counsel\u2019s absence was directly inculpa-tory of the defendant. See U.S. v. Russell, 205 F.3d 768, 772 (5th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Our review of the record leads us to conclude holding the absence of defense counsel during jury reinstruction to be a deprivation of counsel during a critical stage under clearly established federal lawholding cronic not applicable where counsel conceded his clients guilt to protect his own credibility and avoid conviction on other chargesholding that the cronic presumption should apply where counsel was absent for two days during which the probability of his guilt increased during the governments presentation of evidence against his coconspiratorsholding that defendant was not in custody during search of his residenceholding that where defense counsel is absent for even a portion of voir dire reversal under cronic is required in the absence of a waiver & \n\nwhere there has been a complete denial of counsel or where the circumstances are such that any competent attorney would be unable to provide effective assistance, a defendant need not demonstrate that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s actions. Id. at 659-62, 104 S.Ct. at 2047-48. The presumed prejudice exception to Strickland has been found to apply where there was an actual or constructive denial of counsel, the state interfered with counsel\u2019s assistance, or counsel had an actual conflict of interest. See [Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 120 S.Ct. 746, 145 L.Ed.2d 756 (2000) ]. Reaves, 923 A.2d at 1128. See also Commonwealth v. Puksar, 951 A.2d 267, 292-93 (Pa.2008). The U.S. Supreme Court, however, has emphasized that such instances are rare. See Nixon, 543 U.S. at 190, 125 S.Ct. 551 (<HOLDING>). Furthermore, this Court has stressed that holding that a showing of actual prejudice was required where the defendant claimed that counsel was ineffective for conceding guilt at the guilt phase of a capital trialholding that counsels failure to investigate the defendants personal and psychiatric history constituted ineffective assistance during the penalty phase but not during the guilt phaseholding that prejudice was not shown where there was overwhelming evidence of guiltholding that trial courts witness interrogation did not cause defendant prejudice when there was already overwhelming evidence showing defendants guiltholding defendant waived right to challenge incourt identification when he admitted guilt at punishment phase of trial & \n\nsucceed, Pearson\u2019s participation must have somehow harmed Iglesias\u2019s defense. Anticipating our conclusion that estoppel requires a showing of prejudice, the Athridges maintain that prejudice should be presumed in this case. This argument stands on firmer ground: An insured may be entitled to a rebuttable presumption of prejudice, depending on the amount of control the insurer exercised over the defense. See Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 384 F.2d 316, 318 (D.C.Cir.1967); Diamond, 476 A.2d at 657-58. Assuming the Athridges were entitled to this presumption, summary judgment was still proper because Aetna rebutted the presumption with uncontroverted evidence that its participation did not harm Iglesias. Cf. Curtis v. Cuff, 537 A.2d 1072, 1075 (D.C.1987) (<HOLDING>). To begin with, Iglesias knew that Aetna would holding that where uncontroverted evidence rebuts a presumption that a defendant consented to the drivers use of his vehicle the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of lawholding that the defendant did not establish good faith as a matter of lawholding that a drivers knowledge that there are concealable weapons in the car available for the drivers use is evidence of possessionholding that even when a defendant moves under rule 50 at the close of plaintiffs evidence and autocentro did not even do that if a defendant wishes to renew a motion for judgment as a matter of law at the posttrial stage with a view to having denial of that motion considered by the court of appeals the defendant is required to have moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidenceholding that delay caused by or consented to by a defendant is not unreasonable & \n\nappellant\u2019s allegation, our supreme court has held that \u2018\u2018[c]ounsel clearly cannot be faulted for failing to raise a Batson objection at trial because Batson did not yet exist.

Ficco, 438 F.3d 35, 49 (1st Cir.2006). In this case, it is clear that the error complained of \u2014 Goldman\u2019s sentencing as a Career Offender despite the invalidity of one of his essential prior convictions \u2014 had \u201csubstantial and injurious effect.\u201d The government does not dispute that Goldman\u2019s Career Offender status increased his sentence by at least seventeen years. This constitutes a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d and meets the Strickland standard. See Glover v. United States, 531 U.S. 198, 203, 121 S.Ct. 696, 148 L.Ed.2d 604 (2001) (<HOLDING>).

Nevertheless, Defendant unequivocally maintained throughout the proceedings, orally and in writing, that he wished to represent himself. Defendant argues that certain technical errors, specifically a typographical error in the indictment and the prosecutor\u2019s initial misstatement of the maximum sentence at the arraignment, render his conviction invalid. Without a showing of prejudice, these errors do not constitute grounds for reversal. See United States v. Romero, 640 F.2d 1014, 1015 (9th Cir.1981). Defendant has not demonstrated prejudice; the technical errors were promptly corrected. See Garland v. Washington, 232 U.S. 642, 645-46, 34 S.Ct. 456, 58 L.Ed. 772 (1914) (<HOLDING>).

At the core of Marble's argument is the notion that the presumption of adequate assistance is rebutted by a mere showing that defense counsel's acts or omissions amounted to plain error. We disagree. An inquiry into whether counsel was constitutionally ineffective is a separate and distinet inquiry from plain error review, especially where the defendant has conceded that trial counsel invited the alleged errors.

We concluded employer\u2019s delay of nearly seven months in moving to dismiss after employee\u2019s suit did not prejudice employee. Id. Our holding in Mueller is consistent with prior authority finding delay in seeking to compel arbitration insufficient to establish prejudice. See generally Freeman, 924 F.2d at 158-59 (moving party\u2019s use of judicial process and discovery before demanding arbitration not prejudicial to opponent as no issues litigated and limited discovery unusable in arbitration); Nettleton v.

Our concurring colleague, Judge Katzmann, disagrees with our characterization of the quoted language as dictum. In his view, the Supreme Court would not have vacated the state judgment of conviction if it had not been satisfied that Faretta knowingly exercised his right to self-representation; thus, the Court\u2019s discussion of what constitutes a \"knowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of the right to counsel \u201cwas essential to its conclusion that Faretta\u2019s constitutional rights had been violated.\u201d Infra at 566. We are not convinced. Given Faretta's recognition of a constitutional right to represent oneself, the Court might well have vacated the state conviction and remanded the case even without a finding of a valid waiver of the right t 1984) (<HOLDING>); see also United States v. Medina, 944 F.2d holding that for a trial judge to accept a defendants guilty plea without an affirmative showing that it was intelligent and voluntary violates the defendants constitutional rightsholding that right to challenge factual basis is waived by guilty pleaholding that factual basis inquiry is one way of satisfying the constitutional requirement that a guilty plea be voluntary and intelligent but it is not mandated by due processholding that a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal chargeholding that due process requires state courts to make an affirmative showing that a guilty plea is intelligent and voluntary & \n\nrequested an attorney and interrogation had ceased. The Supreme Court of Arizona upheld the conviction, holding that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntarily given. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding \u201cwaivers of counsel must not only be voluntary, but must also constitute a knowing and intelligent relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Id. at 483, 101 S.Ct. 1880. To invoke a Fifth Amendment right to counsel, one must give \u201csome statement that can reasonably be construed to be an expression of a desire for the assistance of an attorney in dealing with custodial interrogation by the police.\u201d McNeil v.

Valdez next argues that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the district court\u2019s sentence enhancements under U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) (firearm possession) and 3B1.1 (leader\/organizer). However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v.

Recent cases analyzing the effect of this change have concluded that under the current ABA standards, the decision whether to request lesser offense instructions is for defense counsel. See Cannon v. Mullin, 383 F.3d 1152, 1167 (10th Cir.2004) (based on change in third edition, \"(whether to argue a lesser-included offense is a matter to be decided by counsel after consultation with the defendant\"); Simeon, 90 P.3d at 184 (relying in part on the change in the ABA standards to hold that the decision to request lesser offense instructions rests with counsel); Mathre v. State, 619 N.W.2d 627, 629-31 (N.D.2000) (<HOLDING>). Additionally, we note that several holding that counsel was not ineffective in failing to request a charge on the lesserincluded offense when the evidence showed either the commission of the completed offense as charged or the commission of no offense such that the defendant was not entitled to a charge on the lesser offenseholding that defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to consult with defendant about seeking lesser offense instructions because under current aba standards the decision is not one that must be made by defendantholding that counsel has a constitutionally imposed duty to consult with the defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think that a rational defendant would want to appealholding that counsel may not be deemed ineffective under strickland for failing to object to jury instructions where this court previously upheld validity of those instructionsholding that where trial counsel was not ineffective appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise claim of ineffectiveness of trial counsel & \n\nand successive petitions under \u00a7 2254, as well as of the evolution of habeas law prior to' passage of the AEDPA, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our sister circuits have held that the denial of a first \u00a7 2254 petition for procedural default, which default is not overcome by a showing of cause and prejudice, \u201cmust be regarded as a determination on the merits in examining whether a subsequent petition is successive.\u201d Bates v.

State, 77 So.3d 1285, 1288 (Fla. 4th DCA 2012) (citing Ingmire, 9 So.3d at 1281). If the State fails to establish willfulness, then Richardson should be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement previously accepted by the trial court. See Lowery v.

The Virgin Islands Supreme Court relied on two theories in concluding that Kendall\u2019s opinion was a clear and present danger to the fairness of the Ford case. Neither passes muster.

Although the State does not advance this argument in its brief, it might be claimed that the defendant had done so by giving direct testimony in which he indicated that he \u201cwould\u201d not \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d \u201cever\u201d have hired someone to kill his mother or have told Pope that it was \u201cokay\u201d to kill her. However, we do not believe that such \u25a0 ambiguous statements, which appear to have been made in the context of attempting to show that the defendant had a close and loving relationship with his mother, and, hence, no motive to kill her, can be fairly construed as an unequivocal assertion of good character that would justify cross-examination about prior violence against others generally. Compare United States v. Collier, 29 M.J. 365 (C.M.A.1990) (<HOLDING>), with State v. Guritz, 134 Or.App. 262, 894 holding that discharge of a police officer for the choice to enter into a relationship with the wife of his superior officer on the force was rationalholding that defendants constitutional right to travel was not abridged when he was ordered not to make contact with the victim he attempted to rapeholding that a defendants answer on direct examination that he would have at eased if ordered to do so by a particular superior officer was not an unequivocal assertion that he possessed the character trait of obedience to orders because the defendants answer could be explained by showing a special relationship to that superior officerholding suspects contradictory answers on miranda waiver form that he would answer questions without an attorney and that he wanted to talk to a lawyer to be ambiguousholding that although jury found officer not to have had probable cause for arrest officer was entitled to immunity because law was not clearly established as to circumstances in which officer found himself & \n\nand that he had a right to rely on the representation to him that he did not owe child-support arrearages. DOR appealed this order. DOR argues that the circuit court erred in three ways: (1) by considering the doctrines of laches and estoppel in the absence of an attempt by the father to plead these issues or prove them at an eviden-tiary hearing; (2) by applying the doctrines of laches and estoppel without sufficient evidence; and (3) by vacating the final order establishing arrearages on the basis of a violation of due process. We decline to address the first argument because DOR failed to object to the circuit court\u2019s consideration of the doctrines at issue, even though it had a clear opportunity to do so. See Matar v. Fla. Int\u2019l Univ., 944 So.2d 1153, 1157-58 (Fla. 3d DCA 2006) (<HOLDING>).

Even if the Enforcement Division\u2019s individual investigatory files contained responsive records, NIGC asserts that those files are law enforcement documents which, in the absence of a waiver, are exempt under FOIA Exemption 7(C) because their disclosure \u201ccould reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of privacy.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C); see Melius v.

Thus, the requested documents are properly exempt from disclosure under FOIA. III. Because the requested documents are exempt from disclosure under either \u00a7 552(b)(6) or \u00a7 552(b)(7)(C), and consequently, also under the Privacy Act, plaintiffs motion for summary judgment must be denied and the Air Force\u2019s motion for summary judgment must be granted.

Circuit has cautioned that holding that competitive harm would result where the agency identified 212 competitors and explained how the requested information could be used in combination with publicly available information to disrupt supply product lines supply chains and customersrecognizing that there is an important privacy interest in corporate financial documents the court agrees that the information can be protected therefore the court required that the information be disclosed pursuant to a confidentiality order only to be used in connection with this litigationholding contact information of potential computer network services clients was not a trade secret because all businesses are now potential customers of computer network services and their contact information is publicly availableholding that the plaintiffs failed to establish unconscionability based upon the alleged excessive cost of arbitration because they failed to supply information as to the actual costs that might be incurredholding that contact list based on inter alia information that was publicly available did not qualify as trade secret & \n\nthis case raises important issues of intergovernmental tax immunity. See Bank of New England, 986 F.2d at 602 n. 4.; see also Federal Reserve, 499 F.2d at 64 (emphasizing the federal nature of question being litigated). Defendant asserts that, even if the RTC\/ FDIC itself could have brought suit in federal court, SN-1 is a private assignee of the RTC\u2019s rights and interests, and does not inherit its federal instrumentality status. The Seventh Circuit, struggling with the interplay between FIRREA and the TIA, concluded that the TIA precluded federal jurisdiction over claims brought not by the RTC or a successor of the federal agency, but by a private party assignee of the federal government. See RTC Commercial Assets Trust v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 169 F.3d 448, 452 (7th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); see also North Georgia Elec. Membership Corp. holding one who claims tax exemption has burden of showing entitlement to exemptionholding act qualifies as exemption statute under exemption 3holding that assignee of rtc could not assert exemption from tiaholding that there is no need to consider exemption 6 separately if information was compiled for law enforcement purposes because exemption 7c constitutes broader protection so any information falling under exemption 6 is covered by exemption 7cholding a debtors claim for loss of consortium to be entitled to an exemption under the oklahoma exemption statute and collecting other bankruptcy decisions recognizing a debtor spouses loss of consortium as the basis for allowing an exemption under federal and various state exemption statutes & \n\nCourt is skeptical that section 6 is properly read as broadly as the government urges. But because the matters alleged by the plaintiffs are, as we will discuss, subject to the state secrets privilege, we need not definitively determine the thorny issue of the proper scope of section 6. b. Section 102A(i)(l) of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 Section 102A(i)(l) states that \u201c[t]he Director of National Intelligence shall pro tect intelligence sources and methods from disclosure.\u201d 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403-1(0(1). Plaintiffs concede this statute allows the Director of National Intelligence to withhold information covered by the statute when it is requested of him or agencies under his control. See, e.g., CIA v. Sims, 471 U.S. 159, 105 S.Ct. 1881, 85 L.Ed.2d 173 (1985) (<HOLDING>); Fitzgibbon v. CIA, 911 F.2d 755 holding that foia exemptions are not mandatory bars to disclosure because the purpose of foia is to provide broad disclosure of government documentsholding that precursor to 102ail could shield against foia requestholding that a foia request should be read to seek all documents covered by a catchallholding that when a plaintiff has no pending foia request with an agency and has not averred that he intends to make foia requests to the agency in the future any claim of future injury is simply too speculative and remote to give him standingholding that a response to a foia request falls within the scope of 3730e4as administrative report provision & \n\nwas lengthy discourse between the parties prior to the filing of the lawsuit. Plaintiff suggests that all documents prepared prior to this date were created in the ordinary course of business, not in anticipation of litigation, and the burden rests on Defendant to show otherwise. Based on this record, Defendant has not provided this Court with sufficient information to determine which documents dated prior to May 28, 2002 that were identified in its Privilege Log are protected by the work product doctrine. Defendant failed to provide this Court with evidentiary proof of objective facts, via affidavits or deposition testimony, that documents before May 28, 2002, the date coverage was expressly denied, were prepared in anticipation of litigation. See, e.g., Totaltape, 135 F.R.D. at 201 (<HOLDING>). The Court will, therefore, find that no holding declaration or affidavit must support work product claim for documents listed solely as work product on privilege logholding that not all of claims file was prepared in anticipation of litigation and noting that the majority of cases that have dealt with the issue of whether investigative materials prepared by insurance claims adjusters is workproduct prepared in anticipation of litigation have held that since insurance companies have a routine duty to investigate accidents such materials are not prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that the work product doctrine applied to a document prepared in anticipation of litigation and was therefore protected from disclosure under foia exemption 5holding that a party failed in meeting its burden that documents were work product because the party resisting discovery failed to present affidavits or other evidentiary support for its contention that the documents were prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that the moving party need not support its motion with affidavits or other evidence if the nonmovant will bear the burden of proof at trial & \n\nno evidence that the management agent or any of its employees filed the appropriate information with the Licensing Board as required by statute. Because no reasonable jury could find that Defendants met the requirements for exemption, the Court finds that Defendants violated the MCALA by failing to register with the Licensing Board prior to engaging in debt collection activities. Despite the' MCALA violation by the management agent and its employees, Plaintiffs claims under the MCALA (Counts XXII-XXIII) fail as pled and argued by Plaintiff because the MCALA does not give rise to a private right of action. See id. \u00a7 7-401; see also Bradshaw, 765 F.Supp.2d at 727-28. Violations of the MCALA may, however, support a cause of action under the FDCPA. See Bradshaw, 765 F.Supp.2d at 729, 732 (<HOLDING>).

Balancing of Harm and Public Interest Similarly, it is doubtful that the balancing of harm and public interest warrant preliminary injunctive relief. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that even minimal interference with the First Amendment freedom of the press causes an irreparable injury. See, e.g., Nebraska Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 559, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976); Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); see also Barbnicki v. Vopper, 532 U.S. 514, 531-32, 121 S.Ct. 1753, 149 L.Ed.2d 787 (2001) (<HOLDING>). The Eleventh Circuit has recognized that the recognizing as a privacy right the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal mattersholding that bargaining unit employees have some nontrivial privacy interest in nondisclosure of their home addresses under the freedom of information act and concluding that that interest substantially outweighed the virtually nonexistent public interest in disclosure under foia and the privacy act not the nlraholding that first amendment interest in publishing matters of public importance outweighed conversants privacy rights given fact that media outlet had played no part in illegal receptionholding that issues involving the local board of education were matters of public importancerecognizing a public employees first amendment right to address matters of legitimate public concern & \n\nthat such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section, if such lien is\u2014 (1) a judicial lien ... 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(f)(1). Thus, under the statute, a debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien if three requirements are met: (1) there was a fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property; (2) the lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled; and (3) the lien is a judicial lien. See Culver, LLC v. Chiu, 304 F.3d 905, 908 (9th Cir.2002). The parties do not dispute that Wilding has met the first and third requirements; Wilding had an interest in his house before the lien attached and the lien was a judicial lien. See Farrey v. Sanderfoot, 500 U.S. 291, 297-98, 111 S.Ct. 1825, 114 L.Ed.2d 337 (1991) (<HOLDING>); see also Patriot Portfolio LLC v.

The 1988 version provided an exemption for \u201ccash surrender value of life insurance in the aggregate amount of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\u201d In 1993, the General Assembly enacted the current version of S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 38-63-40 as part of 1992 Act No. 89, \u00a7 1, which removed the fifty thousand dollar limitation on the cash surrender value exemption and added several key provisions to the statute.

Here, Claim V does not allege that the Service committed any act prohibited under \u00a7 1538 (\u201cProhibited Acts\u201d). Rather, plaintiffs allege that the Service \u201cviolated\u201d several aspirational provisions that govern how the Service implements the ESA and, by extension, CITES. See Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 181-87. These are precisely the sort of \u201cmaladministration\u201d claims that cannot be enforced through the ESA\u2019s citizen-suit provision. See Bennett, 520 U.S. at 174, 117 S.Ct. 1154. This Court and others have recently applied Bennett to foreclose private enforcement of similar claims.

See Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652. Whether the notice actually given is or is not reasonable invariably depends on the circumstances of the individual case. See Garcia v. Meza, 235 F.3d 287, 291 (7th Cir.2000); cf. Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (explaining that due process \u201ccalls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands\u201d). That said, the precedents shed some light on the government\u2019s obligation to notify parties in interest. For instance, the case law has begun to define what the government must do when it seeks to forfeit property belonging to a prison inmate. See Whiting v. United States, 231 F.3d 70, 76 (1st Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>); Giraldo, 45 F.3d at 511 (noting that would-be holding sufficient notice by certified mail to both home address and place of immurementholding us mail sufficient to give notice but mail cannot be expected to notify person who is missing or unknownholding rules of civil procedure are appropriate in determining what constitutes proper service by certified mailholding that property owner was not entitled to relief under cafra because he was given sufficient notice of the administrative forfeiture proceeding through certified mailholding that if service done by certified mail action commenced upon receipt of summons and complaint & \n\nheld that the scope of any waiver by virtue of disclosure was to be defined by the so-called \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d, which'\u201caim[s] to prevent prejudice to a party and distortion of the judicial process that may be caused by the privilege-holder\u2019s selective disclosure during litigation of otherwise privileged information.\u201d Id. at 101.

Since the disclosure in von Bu-low had occurred in an \u201cextrajudicial\u201d setting\u2014by publication of a book\u2014the court there held that the unfairness to which the waiver doctrine was addressed was not implicated.

For support of its contention, Image relies on Wis. Stat. \u00a7 402.207 and several cases applying its provisions. See, e.g., Air Prods. & Chems., Inc. v.

Sydlik\u2019s interpretation is unimportant when we may construe the contract without that interpretation. Certainly, had she stated she did not believe she had released anyone from liability, appellees would not put such stock in her view. Holding to our traditional rules of interpretation for pre-injury releases, we turn now to determine what claims and parties were released within the four corners of the contract. b. Claims Released As we have explained already, to satisfy the express negligence prong, the release must mention all claims it purports to release. Sydlik relies on certain cases to argue that the language in the release is not specific enough. See Ethyl Corp. v. Daniel Constr. Co., 725 S.W.2d 705, 708 (Tex.1987) (<HOLDING>); Victoria Bank & Trust Co., 811 S.W.2d at holding that subcontractor was not obligated to indemnify general contractor for general contractors own negligence where indemnification clause did not expressly state that subcontractor would indemnify general contractor for such negligenceholding that if the party seeking indemnity is held liable in part because of its own negligence common law indemnification is unavailable and the only remedy is contributionholding that illinois construction contract indemnification for negligence act invalidates indemnity provision in contract between general contractor and postal serviceholding that indemnification provision did not expressly state the party was seeking indemnity for its own negligence so as to satisfy express negligence testholding that indemnification without regard to the negligence of any party clearly and unequivocally provided bay drilling with indemnification for its own negligence & \n\nv.

Further, it is well-settled that \u201c[a] party is bound by, and a court is powerless to rewrite, the clear and unambiguous terms of a voluntary contract.\u201d Brooks v. Green, 993 So.2d 58, 61 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008). This principle applies even where the terms of the contract are \u201charsh\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d Id. at 61. (citations omitted). In addition, to give proper meaning to a specific contract provision, a court must consider it in the context of the entire contract. Hand, 983 So.2d at 687. When an employment agreement contains a noncompete covenant, the restriction survives the termination of the agreement if the agreement contains express language demonstrating that the parties intended its survival. Brenner v. Barco Chems. Div., Inc., 209 So.2d 277, 278 (Fla. 3d DCA 1968) (<HOLDING>).

App. 3d 91, 98 (1977). Moreover, if the promisee bargains with the promisor to render a performance directly to a third party, in nearly every case the promisee will have intended to benefit that third party. Fox Lake, 178 Ill. App. 3d at 911. Here, Advanced clearly stands to benefit from the contract between McCormick and Berbee. Thus, this court must determine from the language of the contract and the circumstances surrounding the parties whether the benefit to Advanced is direct or incidental. Although the intent of the parties must be determined on a case-by-case basis, the cases cited by the parties to this appeal provide examples on both sides of this issue. Courts have held that the benefit was direct in the following cases: (1) Carson Pirie Scott, 346 Ill. at 261 (<HOLDING>); (2) Resnik, 78 Ill. 2d at 386-87 (determining holding prior to gonzaga that medicaid provision requiring nursing facilities to provide certain services was intended for the benefit of the recipients and not for the benefit of the facilitiesholding that the parties purchase agreement did not require a showing of prejudice for plaintiff to assert that defendant waived its claim for indemnificationholding that where purchaser had taken possession and paid part of the purchase price the statute of frauds did not bar enforcement of a purchase agreementholding that a creditors pmsi in goods sold to debtors did not survive consolidation of the original installment contract with a later contract for the purchase of additional goodsholding that an agreement to purchase certain goods from a named vendor and pay for them if the hotel company did not was for the direct benefit of the vendor & \n\na third party beneficiary of an agreement made by others has the burden of proving that he was intended by the makers of the agreement to be such beneficiary.\u201d A prospective third-party beneficiary may prove the intent of the parties to an agreement by relying on the unambiguous language of the agreement itself, Valdez v. Cillessen & Son, Inc., 105 N.M. 575, 581, 734 P.2d 1258, 1264 (1987), or, in the absence of such language, on extrinsic evidence such as the circumstances surrounding the execution of the agreement, Permian Basin Inv. Corp. v. Lloyd, 63 N.M. 1, 7, 312 P.2d 533, 537 (1957). A number of courts have applied these general principles of contract law in cases involving the scope of a general release. See, e.g., Neves v. Potter, 769 P.2d 1047, 1053-54 (Colo.1989) (en banc) (<HOLDING>); Harris v.

In the absence of affirmative conduct such as an agreement, contract, statute, or other special circumstance, negligence law generally does not impose affirmative duties, such as the duty to preserve evidence. Id. The question \u201c \u2018[w]hether a duty exists is ultimately a question of fairness.

V. Beazer challenges on two grounds the court\u2019s entry of judgment against it and in favor of Agrico on Agrico\u2019s equitable indemnification claim. First, Beazer contends that under controlling .South Carolina law, equitable indemnification lies only between parties having a contractual or special relationship that did not exist between Beazer and Agri-eo. Second, Beazer contends that equitable indemnity does not lie in favor of a party that itself is at fault in causing the injury for which indemnification is sought and that here Agrico was so at fault. We disagree on both points and find no error in this part of the court\u2019s judgment. Judgment was entered only for litigation costs incurred by Agrico in defending against Dent\u2019s 22, 301 S.E.2d 552, 553 (1982) (<HOLDING>). Here, the jury, answering an interrogatory holding that an indemnitee must be proven to be free of negligence in order to receive indemnity either under a general indemnity agreement or under implied indemnityholding that a shoulder purse carried by a person at the time he is stopped lies within the scope of a warrant authorizing the search of his personrecognizing that the determination is an equitable oneholding that equitable indemnity lies where one person is exposed to liability by the wrongful act of another in which he does not joinholding that duty not to cause injury to another by ones negligent act is too broad to serve as a basis for permitting indemnity & \n\nany officer of the state, or of a country, or of a city or other municipality, could follow them only when he saw fit. If by estoppel such salutary provisions, enacted with wise foresight as checks upon extravagance and dishonesty, can be utterly abrogated at will by any officer, such provisions then subserve no purpose, and the public corporation has no earthly protection against either greed or graft .... Equitable estoppel is impotent to purge transactions of the fatal infirmity of being in violation of law. Id.

Id. at 444 n. 1, 126 S.Ct. 1204. The Court reaffirme that alleges there was never an agreement between the parties to form a contract (and therefore no agreement to form the arbitration clause contained therein) in the first place. To date, the United States Supreme Court has not expressly ruled whether that third category should be decided by the' trial court or the arbitrator, but lower court decisions\u2014both state and federal\u2014 have largely agreed that this third category must be decided by the trial court. See, e.g., Chastain v. Robinson-Humphrey Co., 957 F.2d 851, 854 (11th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); Lepisto v. Senior Lifestyle Newport Ltd. holding that the trial court must determine whether there was ever an agreement when the party resisting arbitration alleged that its signature was a forgeryholding that a court should decide whether the arbitration contract bound parties who did not sign the agreementholding that the trial court must determine whether there was an agreement to arbitrate when the party contesting arbitration claimed she had never signed the contract or intended to be boundholding that a party who has not expressly or implicitly agreed to be bound by an arbitration agreement cannot be compelled to arbitrateholding that the trial court must determine whether an agreement to arbitrate was reached when several contracts the subject of a class action allegedly did not contain an arbitration provision & \n\nand Powell negotiated any aspect of the sales contract or the waiver provision. Both the sales contract and the addendum were pre-printed forms labeled as Bank of America documents. Accordingly, factors four and five, the parties\u2019 negotiations concerning the entire agreement and concerning the waiver provision, weigh against a finding that Martin and Powell knowingly and voluntarily made the waiver. An absence of evidence of negotiation does not meet Bank of America\u2019s burden to produce pri-ma facie evidence of a knowing and voluntary waiver. And the waiver provision here was not conspicuous. It was set forth exactly as the other paragraphs in the addendum; it was not in larger or bolder font than the remainder of the addendum. Cf. In re Gen. Elec. Capital Corp., 203 S.W.3d at 316 (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added); see also Tex. Bus. & holding contractual jury waiver provision that was in all capital letters and was bolded was conspicuousrecognizing that contractual jury waiver provision that was conspicuous because it was in bolded font and in all capital letters met burden of party seeking to enforce provision to make prima facie showing that waiver was knowing and voluntaryholding that the waiver in two previous contracts was insufficient to support waiver of the contract at issue in that appealholding that jury waiver stating that it was made knowingly and voluntarily raised presumption of same and that burden was on party challenging enforceability of jury waiver to present evidence overcoming presumptionholding the jury waiver invalid where waiver was inconspicuous appeared to be nonnegotiable and there was unequal bargaining power & \n\nU.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Thus, in the absence of an injury and with no \u201creal and substantial\u201d dispute, the court properly declined to entertain Count I upon removal. In its Dismissal Opinion, the district court compared this proceeding to the situation in Bowen v. First Family Financial Services, Inc., 233 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir.2000). In Bowen, the class action plaintiffs lacked standing to question whether arbitration agreements are generally unenforceable under the Truth-in-Lending Act. The Eleventh Circuit so ruled because \u201cthere [was] no allegation that First Family has invoked, or threatened to invoke, the arbitration agreement to compel the plaintiffs to submit any claim to arbitration.\u201d Id. at 1339. This action is similar to Bo 02, 704 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (<HOLDING>). Notably, some courts have premised such holding that a dispute arising out of an insurance policy was not covered by the arbitration provision in the parties separate premium payment agreement because if the party had intended to subject this dispute to the arbitration provision it could easily clearly and unequivocally have done so either by including an arbitration provision in the insurance policy itself or by adding to the above arbitration provisionrecognizing as nonjusticiable challenge to arbitration provision absent sufficient indications that it would be invokedholding that an arbitration provision that waived class actions and thus required the consumer to pay a 125 fee to vindicate a 150 claim was substantively unconscionable but also holding that the waiver provision was severable from the remainder of the arbitration provision which would be enforcedholding that the trial court not the arbitrator must decide a challenge to an arbitration provision based on public policyholding that 4 does not empower court to rewrite venue provisions of arbitration clause or to order arbitration within district absent contractual provision so indicating & \n\nhis position as an \u201cex-post facto attempt to add additional terms to the Forbearance Agreement.\u201d Instead, Saverin asserts, he is alleging that Wendy\u2019s bad-faith actions breached the existing terms of the Forbearance Agreement. Specifically, he posits that the very purpose of the Forbearance Agreement was frustrated when Wendy\u2019s failed to prevent the occurrence of a condition \u2014 the appointment of a receiver \u2014 that permitted Wendy\u2019s to prematurely terminate the Forbearance and Franchise Agreements. But this reasoning ignores the principle that the implied duty of good faith cannot be breached by acting as allowed by the specific terms of the contract. Ed Schory & Sons, 662 N.E.2d at 1083; see also Jim White Agency Co. v. Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A., 126 F.3d 832, 834-35 (6th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>). Simply put, Saverin admits that Wendy\u2019s did holding that franchisor not only has valid interest in protecting good will it has developed but it also has an interest in being able to place a new franchisee at or near the same location where its goodwill has been createdholding that a common law breach of contract action will lie for the insurers failure to comply with its obligation to act in good faith and with due care in representing the interests of the insured in its failure to settle with a third partyholding that a lending institution does not violate a separate duty of good faith by adhering to its agreements with a borrower or enforcing its contractual rights as a creditorholding that franchisor has an interest in the goodwill its franchise has createdholding in a case decided under ohio law that a franchisor cannot be found liable for failure to act in good faith where it has done no more than to insist on enforcing its contract rights to the detriment of its franchisee & \n\nprovision that expressly permits PMI to terminate employees covered under the CBA. That provision requires PMI to give employees \u201cthree (3) working days notice before layoff if circumstances reasonably allow.\u201d In addition, the CBA contains a provision stating that \u201c[t]he management and direction of the Plant and working forces is vested in the Company, except insofar as is expressly abridged by specific provisions of this Contract.\u201d This court has held that \u201c[i]t is clear ... that neither federal labor law nor ordinary collective bargaining agreements compel an employer to maintain in operation all or any part of its business.\u201d Heheman v. E.W. Scripps Co., 661 F.2d 1115, 1122 (6th Cir.1981); see also Wimberly v. Clark Controller Co., 364 F.2d 225, 228 (6th Cir.1966) (<HOLDING>). Here, the CBA allows PMI to terminate union holding that the plaintiffs failed to state a cause of action under 301 of the lmra because absent an express contractual provision there is no prohibition against an employer moving its operations to another stateholding that plaintiffs state law claim against a nonsignatory to the cba was preempted by 301holding plaintiffs state law claims of inter alia tortious interference with contract are preempted by section 301 of lmraholding employees negligence claim against his employer was preempted by the lmraholding that an administrative agency or a state courts finding that an employer had just cause to terminate a plaintiff is not preclusive with regard to the plaintiffs discrimination claim against the employer & \n\n\u201c(I)ssue preclusion requires that the party against whom issue preclusion is asserted in the present action was a party or in privity with a party to the prior adjudication.\u201d TLT Const. v. A. Anthony Tappe & Assoc., 48 Mass.App.Ct. 1, 5 (1999). M. and J. filed the application for criminal process against Benoit in the Leominster District Court on February 14, 1997, and thus were plainly parties in the district court adjudication. To establish S. was in privity with M. and J., there \u201chas to be a \u2018sufficient legal identity\u2019 between the interest of the person allegedly represented and the prior litigant for the later claim to be precluded.\u201d Mongeau v. Boutelle, 10 Mass.App.Ct. 246, 250 (1980) (citation omitted). See Boyd v. Jamaica Plain Co-Operative Bank, 7 Mass.App.Ct. 153, 158 (1979) (<HOLDING>). A \u201cnonparty to a prior adjudication can be holding that the current party was sufficiently identified with the parties to the prior litigationholding that prevailing party was entitled to attorneys fees under an option contract which had expired prior to litigation because the parties were litigating their performance under the terms of the contractholding that the party prevailing on the significant issues in the litigation is the party that should be considered the prevailing party for attorneys feesholding that a judgment as to the title in a prior litigation was not subject to collateral attackholding res judicata did not bar current litigation when prior litigation between the parties involved one breach of obligation under a joint venture agreement and instant litigation was based upon a different cause of action from a subsequent interference with the same agreement & \n\nexpert witness, testified that the existence of an annual renewable employment agreement between the Foundation and D\u2019Unger was consistent with generally accepted accounting practices and corporate governance standards regarding how corporate officers are employed and compensated. The Foundation\u2019s by-laws provide that \u201c[ejection or appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.\u201d In light of that evidence, D\u2019Un-ger\u2019s testimony about his understanding of the one-year, renewable term of his employment with the Foundation, standing alone, will not support a finding that the Foundation agreed to an employment contract that limited its right to terminate D\u2019Unger. See Williams v. First Tenn. Nat\u2019l Corp., 97 S.W.3d 798, 804 (Tex.App.Dallas 2003, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). D\u2019Unger was required to present probative holding that language in employee handbook stating that it was not to be considered as creating terms and conditions of an employment contract and that the employment relationship was employment atwill was sufficiently explicit to preclude the creation of implied contractual obligations as a matter of lawholding where employee handbook and employment offer letter disclaimed creation of employment contract that employees testimony of his understanding of terms of agreement did not raise fact issue of specific express and clear agreement contradicting the express provisions of the personnel manual and the employment offer letterholding offer of continued atwill employment did not constitute consideration for the arbitration agreementholding that under arkansas law employment is atwill unless personnel manual or employment agreement contains express provision that employee shall not be discharged except for causeholding that whether a personnel policy manual modifies an employment contract is a question of fact & \n\ncase. Reilly\u2019s defense depends, in part, on Riggs\u2019 performance under the agreement. Indeed, Riggs\u2019 execution of the terms of the Trust Agreement has already been placed in issue by the parties. TRST has claimed Riggs expressly or implicitly waived Article X, Section 10.02 of the Trust Agreement. Thus, in deciding this case, the Court could determine Riggs breached the Trust Agreement or was negligent in signing or performing the contract and absolve Reilly of liability. Such a finding could be unfairly detrimental to Riggs. Although there is no danger of issue preclusion in the case pending in Washington, D.C., a negative precedent could impair Riggs in that litigation; that is, assuming this case is decided first. See Pulitzer-Polster v. Pulitzer, 784 F.2d 1305, 1309 (5th Cir.1986) (<HOLDING>). In addition, if the D.C. Court acknowledged holding that an assertion of prejudice is not a showing of prejudiceholding that a finding of no plain error on direct appeal precludes a finding of prejudice under stricklandholding lack of prejudice to the defendant is not good causeholding nonagency defendants were properly joined as indispensable parties under rule 19 but recognizing no apa cause of action could stand against themholding that a negative precedent can cause enough prejudice to an absentee for a finding of indispensability under rule 19 & \n\naward, do not justify overturning that award. Instead, only \u201cutterly irrational\u201d legal conclusions will be cognizable; \u201c[i]n these circumstances the appropriate standard of review is whether the construction of the contract presents such an egregious mistake that it amounts to an arbitrary remaking of the contract between the parties.\u201d 277 Cal.Rptr. at 714. Other jurisdictions have applied stricter standards for upsetting an award than that adopted by the plurality. E.g., Department of Parks & Tourism v. Resort Managers, Inc., 294 Ark. 255, 743 S.W.2d 389, 391-92 (1988) (reviewing Uniform Arbitration Act and holding mistakes of law insufficient to overturn an award absent fraud or corruption); Jackson Trak Group, Inc. v. Mid States Port Auth., 242 Kan. 683, 751 P.2d 122, 127 (1988) (<HOLDING>); Runewicz v. Keystone Ins. Co., 476 Pa. 456, holding that an award of arbitration cannot be set aside for mere errors of judgment either as to the law or the facts if the award is within the scope of the submission and the arbitrators are not guilty of the acts of misconduct set forth in the statute the award operates as a final and conclusive judgment and however disappointing it may be the parties must abide by itholding that manifest disregard of the law is one of the very unusual circumstances in which a federal court can set aside an arbitration awardholding that errors of law without accompanying fraud or misconduct not enough to set aside arbitration awardholding that the trial court was without authority to set aside entry of default on motion to set aside default judgmentrecognizing that a trial court can set aside verdict & \n\nBy all accounts, the executed Partnership Agreement was the result of an arm\u2019s length transaction. Also, the Partnership Agreement specifically, allowed for the payment of developer fees, and several other provisions effectively established that Dr. Cravens .knew so. Given Dr. Cravens\u2019s individual characteristics, abilities, and appreciation of the facts and circumstances at or before the time of the alleged misrepresentation, we hold that the evidence is legally insufficient to show that Dr. Cravens justifiably relied upon any representation that developer fees would not be paid until after a construction loan was secured. See Atlas Props., Inc. v. Republic Waste Servs of Tex., Ltd., No. 02-11-00332-CV, 2012 WL 579442, at *2-3 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth Feb. 23, 2012, no pet.) (mem.op.) (<HOLDING>); cf. Gulf Liquids New River Project, LLC v. holding that it is unreasonable for plaintiffs to rely on oral representations made before a contract when the contract contained a clause which expressedholding that party could not justifiably rely upon oral representations thatwere directly contradicted by terms of written agreementholding that a person could not reasonably rely on oral representations that contradict a written documentholding that the parties agreement was superseded by a subsequent agreement that stated that it comprises the entire agreement and supersedes all prior understandings and representations oral or written between the partiesholding that plaintiff could not have reasonably relied on an oral representation that the atwill provision of his employment contract did not apply to him when he entered into the contract that expressly contradicted the oral representations & \n\nbetween Long Creek, Little River, Limehouse, and Lake Wylie, the Court can attest that the factual premise of Rickborn\u2019s argument is an understatement. Nevertheless, that prevalence of pickups is not persuasive. The command to construe an exclusion against the insurer applies only when the exclusion\u2019s meaning is ambiguous. See State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v. Nivens, No. 0:12-cv-151-MBS, 2014 WL 4793987, at *5 (D.S.C. Sept. 25, 2014) (stating the rule applies \u201c \u2018if doubt exists as to the extent or fact of coverage\u2019 \u201d (quoting Buddin v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 250 S.C. 332, 157 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1967)) (emphasis added)). As this Court has explained, exclusion A.7 is not ambiguous on the issue of whether a pickup is a private passenger auto. Cf. Home Indem. Co., 280 F.Supp. at 448 (<HOLDING>). Finally, Rickborn asserts it would be recognizing that certainly under many circumstances a pickup truck is used by its owner as a private passenger automobile but nonetheless holding that policy read as a whole unambiguously excluded pickups from that termholding that a contract will be read as a whole and the intent of each part will be gathered from a consideration of the wholerecognizing that a statute should be read as comprehensive wholeholding pickup truck was not a private passenger automobile under policy although that term standing alone might be ambiguous there was no room for misunderstanding whether it included pickups because separate defined policy term included pickupsholding that because public use of a beach was permissive the public was a licensee and as such could be excluded from the whole area at any time by the title owner & \n\n"}

The defendants\u2019 reliance on a string of cases holding that municipal attorneys in positions similar to Selkirk\u2019s were not protected by Elrod and Branti, is irrelevant and misplaced. The very essence of the following cases required an examination of the duties of each plaintiff to ascertain whether his position entailed \u201cpolicymak-ing\u201d responsibility or required political fealty to effectively perform.

Neither court has used the holding that individuals can be held liable under 1981 only when they have been personally involved or directly participated in the discriminationholding that even a temporary deprivation of first amendment rights constitutes irreparable harmholding that liability under 1983 can be established by showing that the defendants either personally participated in a deprivation of the plaintiffs rights or caused such a deprivation to occurholding that liability under 1983 requires a causal link to and direct responsibility for the deprivation of rightsholding that a superior can be held liable in his individual capacity if he participated in the deprivation of a plaintiffs constitutional rights & \n\nNicholson alleges that defendants Doherty and Damiani required him to plead and stand trial when the mandatory probable cause hearing had not been held and when there was insufficient cause to support the charges against him. In addition, he alleges that defendant Damiani improperly ordered the information amended after trial. These actions are taken in a judge\u2019s judicial capacity and are within the judge\u2019s jurisdiction. Thus, defendants Damiani and Doherty are protected from suit for damages by a p.2d 602, 626-27 (D.Md.1999) (citing cases for the proposition that municipal departments, including the police department, are not persons within the meaning of section 1983); Gaines v.

Like an award made pursuant to the court\u2019s inherent power, an award under \u00a7 1927 is proper when the attorney\u2019s actions are so plainly without merit as to require the conclusion that they must have been undertaken for some improper purpose. See, e.g., Oliveri v. Thompson, 803 F.2d 1265, 1273 (2d Cir.1986) (police photographs of client taken an hour after incident in which police officers allegedly employed excessive force in taking client into custody did not constitute such clear evidence of absence of excessive force to render client\u2019s attorney liable for his adversary\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees as a result of bad faith); Acevedo v. Immigration and Naturalization Serv., 538 F.2d 918, 920 (2d Cir.1976) (<HOLDING>). \u201c[T]he only meaningful difference between an holding that evidence submitted for a motion to reopen must be material and state new facts that rebut the underlying findingholding that there was no new and material evidence to reopen claim where newly presented evidence was not accompanied by any medical evidence indicating a nexus to serviceholding petition seeking review of motion to reopen deportation hearing in the absence of new evidence as without merit under 1927 since petitioner was not entitled to reopen except on showing of significant new evidenceholding that a motion to reopen seeking only to apply for a form of relief which was unavailable to the movant at the time of the hearing is subject to the regulatory requirements governing motions to reopenholding that a properly filed motion to reopen is a prerequisite to the filing of a new asylum application when the petitioner is under a final removal order & \n\nof Water and Soil Resources (BWSR). The district\u2019s licensing requirement was considered and approved by the BWSR, the state entity with oversight authority. Based on this record, the water shed district\u2019s decision to adopt a licensing requirement was a policy-based decision protected by statutory discretionary immunity under Minn.Stat. \u00a7 466.03, subd. 6. II. A municipality is also immune from liability arising from \u201c [a]ny * * * act or omission of an officer or employee, exercising due care, in the execution of a valid or invalid * * * rule.\u201d Minn.Stat. \u00a7 466.03, subd. 5 (1996). Landview argues that due care is a fact question that precludes summary judgment, relying on Boop v. City of Lino Lakes, 502 N.W.2d 409 (Minn.App.1993), review denied (Minn. Sept. 10, 1993). See id. at 411 (<HOLDING>).

Id. at 260. Accepting the Cities\u2019 claims as true, the Court finds that the Cities have alleged a causal connection between Monsanto\u2019s distribution of PCBs and contamination of the Bay. iii. The Cities may bring public nuisance claims for damages. Monsanto argues that the Cities cannot seek damages based on a public nuisance claim against a product manufacturer. MTD at 23-24. Such claims, Monsanto says, are \u201cstrongly disfavored in California\u201d because courts view them as \u201cimproper end-run[s] around products liability laws.\u201d Id at 24; City of Modesto, 119 Cal.App.4th at 39, 13 Cal.Rptr.3d 865 (\u201cthe law of nuisance is not intended to serve as a surrogate for ordinary products liability\u201d); City of San Diego v.

Public entities generally may not bring holding that where a city brought a public nuisance claim based on asbestos in its buildings it had essentially pleaded a products liability action not a nuisance actionholding that the plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue a permanent nuisance action for injury to property because none of the plaintiffs were the owners of the land when the cause of action accrued with the first injuryrecognizing products liability and products actions based on negligence as part of the general maritime lawholding that the viability of a negligence action against a municipality under 1147190 determines the success or failure of a nuisance action based upon the same factsrecognizing that substantial change is a defense to a products liability claim & \n\nthe circuit court determines that amending his petition would do substantial justice.

Proc. \u00a7 8-301 to, inter alia, comply with the pleading requirement contained in Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9)). In determining whether allowing Respondent to amend his petition would do substantial justice, the circuit court must articulate its reasoning on the record. If the circuit court concludes that Respondent may amend his petition to comply with the pleading requirement in Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9), Respondent\u2019s averment must allege which convictions he is \u201cactually innocent\u201d of, meaning which offenses he alleges he \u201cdid not commit.\u201d See Smallwood, 451 Md. at 320, 152 A.3d at 793 (<HOLDING>); see also Maryland Rule 4\u2014332(d)(9). holding that only defendants who can allege they are actually innocent meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they are convicted may bring a petition for relief under crim proc 8301holding that neglect was not excusable where the defendants did not do all that they were required to do after they received the summons and complaint in that they did not contact a lawyer or make any other arrangements with respect to their defenseholding that officers were entitled to qualified immunity because they did not know the residence for which they obtained a warrant actually contained multiple unitsholding in the context of a motion for preliminary injunction that once federal funds are distributed to the states and obligated they cannot be recouped and that it would be impossible to award the plaintiffs the relief they request if they should eventually prevail on the meritsholding that claims are related if they involve a common core of facts or they are based on related legal theories & \n\nwas transferred back to DCXOM because Defendants wanted to get rid of him. 1. Individual Liability Wilson alleges claims of race discrimination pursuant to Title VII, the ELCRA, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 against Budco and Raymond. As Wilson conceded during a hearing on the motion, an individual who does not qualify as an \u201cemployer\u201d is not subject to individual liability under Title VII. Wathen v. General Elec.

See id. at 424-26. Not all of Appellant\u2019s allegations serving as a basis for his Bivens claim involve individual action leading to final agency decisions reviewable pursuant to the APA. For example, Appellant\u2019s allegations that some Defendants denied him certain rights pursuant to his management plan is properly challenged in an administrative proceeding. Therefore, a Bivens claim for that particular allegation is precluded. However, several of Appellant\u2019s allegations of Defendants\u2019 intentional misconduct are unrelated to any final agency action and are therefore properly within the scope of a Bivens claim. See, e.g., Zephyr Aviation, 247 F.3d at 572-573 (<HOLDING>); Western Center for Journalism, v. Cederquist, holding that a bivens cause of action cannot be maintained against a federal agencyholding that social security regulations and procedures precluded a bivens actionholding that court would not imply a bivens cause of action for a prisoner held in a private prison facilityrecognizing potential of bivens action for extraprocedural and unconstitutional actions by faa inspectors while acknowledging that a bivens action would be unavailable to challenge the faas attachment of condition notice to companys airplaneholding that a bivens claim cannot be brought against a federal agency & \n\nstage of the litigation, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled the ultra vires exception to the Eleventh Amendment and, thus, Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 state law claims as to the individual basis, on this basis, is denied. D. Federal Claims Against Defendants Cuomo, Lippman, Prudenti, Hite, Ahl, Hanrahan, Megna, and DiNapoli in their Individual Capacities Plaintiffs assert \u00a7 1983 claims for monetary damages, injunctive relief, and declaratory judgment against Defendants Cuomo, Lippman, Prudenti, Hite, Ahl, Hanrahan, Megna, and DiNapoli, individually. Suits against state officials in their personal capacity are not barred by the Eleventh Amendment, even for actions required by their official duties, Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 27-28, 112 S.Ct. 358, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991) (<HOLDING>); however, such actions may be subject to holding that states and state officials acting in their official capacity are not persons under 1983holding that a state officer sued in his individual capacity may be held personally liable for damages under 42 usc 1983 based upon actions taken in his official capacityholding state of north carolina and state official sued in their official capacity are immune from 1983 and 1985 actions in federal courtholding that eleventh amendment does not bar suits for prospective injunctive relief against state officials in their official capacityholding that state officials may be personally liable for actions taken in their official capacity & \n\nsalutary protection of the people against their own representatives which such legislation is designed to secure. Luzerne Township v. Fayette County, 330 Pa. 247, 252, 199 A. 327, 330 (1938). Because there was no meeting of the minds, no compliance with the statutory provisions necessary to properly execute a binding agreement on County\u2019s behalf and no material fact at issue, the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment must be affirmed. ORDER AND NOW, this 11th day of June, 1997, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Tioga County in the above-captioned matter is hereby AFFIRMED. PELLEGRINI, J., concurs in the result only. 1 . Act of July 3, 1986, P.L. 388, as amended, 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 271-286. 2 . See Keenheel v. Pennsylvania Securities Commission, 134 Pa.Cmwlth. 494, 579 A.2d 1358 holding that section 13 of the sunshine act 65 ps 283 grants the court discretion to invalidate any or all official actions taken at illegally closed meetingsholding that the official charged with responsibility to act must be an official within the doj with the authority to act in the circumstancesholding that a state official can be held individually hable under 1983 for acts taken within the scope of his or her official dutiesholding texas open meeting act prohibiting governmental body from conducting closed meetings during which public business or public policy over which the governmental body has supervision or control is discussed to be contentneutral because closed meetings 1 prevent transparency 2 encourage fraud and corruption and 3 foster mistrust in governmentholding that state officials may be personally liable for actions taken in their official capacity & \n\nfunds that is required for the imposition of the statutory trust. Cucinotti next contends that the trial court erred in holding him personally liable. He points out that Reliance rested its theory of personal liability on several grounds, each of which was essentially abandoned in favor of the participation theory as articulated by the Supreme Court in its decision in Saltiel v. GSI Consultants, Inc., 170 N.J. 297, 788 A.2d 268 (2002), a decision released while the Reliance summary judgment motion was pending. While there are other reported decisions that hold that corporate officers who participate in fraud or conversion can be held personally liable for the losses occasioned thereby, see, e.g., Charles Bloom & Co. v. Echo Jewelers, 279 N.J.Super. 372, 382, 652 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.l995)(<HOLDING>); Robsac Indus., Inc. v. Chartpak, 204 holding defendants personally liable for alleged conversion even when acting in corporate capacityholding that a state officer sued in his individual capacity may be held personally liable for damages under 42 usc 1983 based upon actions taken in his official capacityholding that a corporate officer signing a contract in his corporate capacity is generally not liable for damages under the contractholding that the plaintiffs were entitled to discovery to determine whether the defendant intended to be bound in his personal andor corporate capacity where the agreement contained certain personal guarantees by the defendant but where the defendant signed the agreement only in a corporate capacity with no signature blocks provided for signing in a personally capacityholding that state officials may be personally liable for actions taken in their official capacity & \n\nthe protest in question here. Accordingly, Plaintiff\u2019s protest fails to present a timely, valid challenge to Customs\u2019 acceptance of MPF tender, as Plaintiff filed that protest more than ninety days after Customs\u2019 decision. Based on the analysis above, the Court concludes that Plaintiff\u2019s protest dated February 6, 1995, was untimely filed, as Plaintiff failed to file it within ninety days of the Customs decisions that it seeks to challenge. Plaintiff, however, sets forth one additional argument to support its contentions that it filed a timely protest. CRMC appears to argue that its subsequent actions cured the defects of the untimely prot\u00e9st. Plaintiff claims that it properly filed, on February 10, 2000, a request for accelerated disposition t. App. 113, 117, 603 F.2d 850, 853 (1979) (<HOLDING>); Everflora Miami, Inc. v. United States, 19 holding that although the jurisdiction limitation also works to make decisions final and conclusive upon the government unless it acts to revise them within the limitations period there was no such decision that triggered the ninetyday period and consequently a failure to invoke jurisdictionholding that the proper focus when determining the starting point of the limitations period is upon the time of the discriminatory acts not upon the time at which the consequences of the acts became most painful holding that the court lacked jurisdiction over customs allegedly erroneous duty assessments because the importer failed to timely protest liquidation which thereby made the customs decision final and conclusive upon the partiesholding that refusal by customs officials to reliquidate entries became final and conclusive upon the importer when it failed to file a protest within the previously mandated sixtyday limitations periodholding that the charge was timely when filed within the statute of limitations period even though served after the period & \n\nAR016969. For each of these forms of take, NMFS set limits for that take and metrics designed to measure the take. AR016969-71. STANDARDS Summary judgment is appropriate if the \u201cmovant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). \u25a0 All of plaintiffs\u2019 claims at issue in the present motions are gov n Kraayenbrink, the APA\u2019s standard of review will be applied to plaintiffs\u2019 claim and plaintiffs must prove that NMFS\u2019 failure to reinitiate consultation was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A) (emphasis added); 632 F.3d at 481 (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, if plaintiffs \u25a0 prove that the holding that courts should review claims brought under the esa under the citizensuit provision of the esa or when the citizensuit provision is unavailable under the apaholding that courts of appeals should review the facts necessary to determine whether an exemption to the flsa applies in a particular under the clearly erroneous standardholding that judicial review under the apa is precluded when a remedy is available under a citizen suit provision of an environmental statute citations omittedholding that when considering an agency action as to which the statute does not specify the standard of review the courts of appeals must proceed pursuant to the apas general standard of review for agency actions in 5 usc 7062aholding that irrespective of whether an esa claim is brought under the apa or the citizensuit provision the apas standard of review applies & \n\nprotest pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(b). Pl.\u2019s Opp\u2019n at 4. However, such a request cannot cure a timing defect in the underlying protest. For Plaintiff\u2019s claim to be within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the referenced protest must first be filed in accordance with 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514. As Plaintiff\u2019s protest was untimely, Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent request for accelerated disposition could not revive it. The Court therefore holds that the protest dated February 6, 1995, was untimely and improperly filed. Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s subsequent acts failed to cure or amend its original protest. Because Plaintiff failed to file a valid protest, Customs\u2019 decisions are final and this Court lacks jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581(a). New Zealand Lamb Co. v.

We also note that Palomo bases his argument on the method by which the prosecution obtained Padilla's personnel file, but Palomo has no standing to assert Padilla's physician-patient privilege. The physician-patient privilege is personal to the patient or her estate. Stauffer v. Karabin, 30 Colo.App. 857, 362, 492 P.2d 862, 864 (1971). Courts routinely deny defendants the standing to assert a third party's right, including the physician-patient privilege. Knight v.

Even if Ek did misappropriate these items, Peterson does not have standing to assert the claim of a third party. Standing in this court is a rule of judicial self-restraint that asks whether the person raising a particular claim is a \" 'proper party to request an adjudication of a particular issue.' \u201d Moore v. State, 553 P.2d 8, 23 n. 25 (Alaska 1976) (quoting Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 100-01, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968)). We cannot consider the purported transfer of the materials lien from Dockery to Peterson because it was not in the record before the superior court and was improperly included in Peterson's excerpt of record. Alaska R.App. P. 210. See also B.B. v. D.D., 18 P.3d 1210, 1214 (Alaska 2001) (<HOLDING>).

Here, Locke seeks medical reports relating to thousands of non-party claimants without their consent. He argues that the physician-patient privilege and right to privacy do not preclude him from obtaining redacted TWCC-69 Forms like the ones he offered below. However, \u201cmerely because a person ... has filed a claim with an insurance company does not necessarily mean the person ... has consented to making his medical records public.\u201d See In re Dolezal, 970 S.W.2d 650, 652-53 (Tex.App. \u2014 Corpus Christi, 1998, orig. proceeding) (<HOLDING>).

It grants him the privilege of being confronted with the witnesses against him; but if he voluntarily keeps the witnesses away, he cannot insist on his privilege. If, therefore, when absent by his procurement, their evidence is supplied in some lawful way, he is in no condition to assert that his constitutional rights have been violated. Id. at 158. In other words, while the Constitution does grant a privilege of confronting ones accusers, that privilege is lost if the accuser causes the witness's unavailability at trial. \u00b6 40. Since the Reynolds decision, the Court has continued to acknowledge the concept that a defendant can forfeit through misconduct his or her confrontation rights. See, e.g., Diaz v. United States, 223 U.S. 442, 451-53 (1912) (<HOLDING>); Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 106 holding that a hearsay statement can itself be considered in first determining if a conspiracy existed when the statement was madeholding that defendant who introduced hearsay statement waived objection to admission of another part of same statementholding that a defendant waives right to object to a hearsay statement on confrontation grounds when he or she offers the statementholding that a statement implying that the defendant was guilty of the crime for which he was on trial was inadmissible hearsayholding prior statement subject to crossexamination when made does not violate confrontation clause & \n\nGovernment has waived any possibility of a \u00a7 9.51 defense by failing to raise it in its answer. We find this contention to be without merit. The Government did assert a law enforcement officer\u2019s privilege to use force in its motion to dismiss. Such an assertion suffices to raise the defense. See Terrell v. DeConna, 877 F.2d 1267, 1270 (5th Cir.1989) (\"The defendant ... raised the defense of issue preclusion by a motion to dismiss. That motion was sufficient to raise the defense, and there was therefore no waiver.\u201d). Further, the parties' joint pretrial order listed whether \"federal agents were privileged to use reasonable force in effectuating the detention of [Villafranca].\u201d Raising the defense there was also sufficient. See Vanhoy v. United States, 514 F.3d 447, 450-51 (5th Cir.2008) (<HOLDING>). 3 . There is some dispute about whether the holding that defendant does not waive an affirmative defense if defendant raises it at a pragmatically sufficient time such as summary judgment and the defendants failure raise the affirmative defense in its answer did not cause the plaintiff prejudiceholding that the government did not waive an affirmative defense not pleaded in the answer because it raised the defense at a pragmatically sufficient time by listing the defense in the joint pretrial orderholding that defendants failure to assert the defense in any pretrial motions did not waive defendants limitations defense because the assertion of a limitations defense in the answer preserved defendants right to raise the defense both during the first trial and before the secondholding that the district court properly allowed the defendant who asserted the disputed defense as a contested issue of law in the joint pretrial order to pursue the defense despite the defendants failure to comply with rule 8cholding that mitigation of damages is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded & \n\nbe held liable for acts of infringement if that defendant is either contribu-torily or vicariously liable for another\u2019s direct act of infringement. Where those acts of infringement occur within the United States and a plaintiff seeks to hold a foreign defendant contributorily or vicariously liable for those acts, it has been held that subject matter jurisdiction may exist, and that the exercise thereof does not conflict with the doctrine of nonextraterri-toriality.

It has been held that a disclosure sufficient to waive the work product protection does not have to be intentional; therefore inadvertent or unintentional disclosures of protected materials also might result in the waiver of the privilege. See, e.g., Carter v. Gibbs, 909 F.2d 1450, 1451 (Fed.Cir.1990). However, such a disclosure does not automatically forfeit the attorney work product privilege. In determining whether a party has waived the privilege- through an inadvertent or involuntary disclosure, courts consider, among other factors,- the steps taken by a party to remedy the disclosure and any delay in doing so. See, e.g., United States v. Keystone Sanitation Co., 885 F.Supp. 672, 676 (M.D.Pa.1994); cf. United States v. de la Jara, 973 F.2d 746, 749-50 (9th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>).

Because Cook did not name any particular third party with whom he had a reasonable expectation of a business relationship, or toward whom Winfrey directed her interfering actions, the court concluded that the complaint was inadequate. Cook responds to this dismissal by identifying Illinois cases holding that the plaintiff may point to an identifiable \u201cclass\u201d of third parties with whom he had a business expectancy (and toward whom the defendant directed her interfering actions), rather than a single third party. See, e.g., River Park, Inc. v. City of Highland Park, 281 Ill.App.3d 154, 217 Ill.Dec. 410, 667 N.E.2d 499, 507 (1996) (<HOLDING>); Parkway Bank & Trust Co. v.

Strunk, 670 N.E.2d 1280, 1284 (Ind.1996). \u201cAbsent a duty, there can be no breach, and therefore, no recovery for the plaintiff in negligence.\u201d Pfenning, 947 N.E.2d at 398 (citation omitted).

While I find that Crivello is credible that the rig op were justified, defendants argue that Crivello did not have a reasonable suspicion authorized borrower of the ear, had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the RV itself, but only that he lacked such an expectation in the closet. I disagree because he was the driver of the car at the time of the stop, had possession of the keys to the car, had been living in the RV for the two days prior to the search, and planned to use the RV as a home for the duration of the cross-country trip.

The court finds these alleged statements insufficient because they are unaccompanied by facts which demonstrate their accuracy or Defendants\u2019 involvement or control in their preparation. Moreover, as recently determined by one court in this district: \u201ca plaintiff cannot meet the requirements of the PSLRA and Rule 9(b) merely by pleading the specific time, place, and contents of misleading statements by a specifically identified analyst. Rather, to hold a defendant liable for misleading statements published by a third party, the plaintiff must at least identify the defendant who provided the information that the third party made public to the market.\u201d Barrie, 2002 WL 1841631, * 3; see also Suna v.

The once-existing special relationship and ability to control Haar\u2019s treatment disintegrated as a result of Haar\u2019s failure after March 8, 2000, to seek Defendant\u2019s assistance in any regard and Haar\u2019s having chosen other mental health providers to handle his treatment and medication. See Millbaugh v. Gilmore, 30 Ohio St.2d 319, 285 N.E.2d 19, 21 (1972) (<HOLDING>); cf. Paradies v.

Because a decedent\u2019s survival claim becomes part of her estate at death, it follows that the estate retains a justicia-ble interest in the survival action. We therefore hold that, in a survival action, the decedent\u2019s estate has a justiciable interest in the controversy sufficient to confer standing. See Landers, 369 S.W.2d at 35 (noting that a survival action seeks recovery for \u201cdamages sustained by the decedent and his estate as a result of the [wrongful] injuries.\u201d) (emphasis added); see also Glickstein v.

If Boswell had authority over the case, whether joint or sole, then he had authority to consent to its search.

In this Circuit, courts have exempted fraudulent transfer claims from arbitration because they are statutory claims belo (2d Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). However, none of those decisions undermines holding judgment in violation of automatic stay voidrecognizing district courts authority to dispose of contempt action for violation of automatic stay of bankruptcyholding that a postdischarge claim for violation of the automatic stay was arbitrable because it would not necessarily jeopardize or inherently conflict with the bankruptcy codeholding that the automatic stay did not bar the filing of a proof of claim where the debtor actively litigated a separate action during the pending bankruptcy proceeding because to permit the automatic stay provision to be used as a trump card played after an unfavorable result was reached would be inconsistent with the underlying purpose of the automatic stayrecognizing that any action taken in violation of the automatic bankruptcy stay is void and without effect & \n\nbroad clauses have their limits. Because we are concerned only with the dispute before us and its connection with or relation to the several agreements before us, we need not explore these outer limits,\u201d). In PaineWebber, the Fifth Circuit declined to apply the arbitration clauses from three Option Agreements to a dispute arising under a separate Referral Agreement. PaineWebber, Inc. v. Chase Manhattan Private Bank, 260 F.3d 453, 464 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cCertainly, the extremely broad language of these clauses, if read in a vacuum, would appear to bind the parties to arbitrate any and all disputes that may arise between them. When read in context as they must be, however, the reach of the arbitration clauses in the Option Agreements is simply not capable of such an expansive grasp.\u201d Id. (<HOLDING>). Here, the loan and checking account holding that under an option requiring renewal at the expiration of the lease but providing no more specific time requirement the lessee had a reasonable time to exercise the option within the term of the leaseholding that even if the doctrine applies to option contracts no conversion would take place until the option were exercised by the party having the right of electionholding that option agreements were limited in time and scope and in no way modified or superceded referral agreementholding in part that the utah state probation agreement does not create such an optionholding that agreement referencing rights and remedies of another agreement was subject to the referenced agreements arbitration clause & \n\nthe rule allows such a safe harbor.\u201d Id. Although Guardsmark explained the safe harbor to some employees, the Board found the company\u2019s explanation \u201cplainly insufficient to avoid a violation of the Act [because] narrowing interpretations of overly broad rules must be communicated to the entire work force covered by the rule.\u201d Id. at *5. Guardsmark argues that nothing in the rule explicitly prohibits off-duty solicitation and that employees would not reasonably so construe it, especially after the company clarified the rule\u2019s safe harbor. We disagree. To begin with, because Guardsmark failed to communicate the safe harbor clarification to all employees who had received the handbook, the Board properly focused on the rule\u2019s language. See Ichikoh Mfg., Inc., 312 N.L.R.B. 1022, 1022 (1993) (<HOLDING>). And because that language prohibits holding that it is notholding that employees failure to comply with employers rule requiring employees to notify employer when a temporary job placement ended did not constitute gross misconduct because the violation was an isolated incident and employer did not try to show that its staffing ability had suffered serious or indeed any consequences as a result of employees unavailabilityholding that an employer must establish all three elements of the defense with regard to its employees in order to prevailholding that an employer must show that it clearly communicated to all the employees to whom the presumptively invalid rule was disseminated that the rule did not mean what it saidholding that the hospital failed to show how it was harmed by failure to verify the rule to show cause & \n\nand Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment \u00a7 9.2(a) (5th ed. 2012) (discussing Terry as permitting a stop or seizure when an officer reasonably suspects a person has committed, is committing, or is about to commit a crime). As noted above, the officer who frisked Terry did so not because he believed Terry had committed a crime, but because he believed Terry was going to do so. Accordingly, if an officer reasonably suspects a person is about to commit a crime, a protective pat search is warranted in the interests of officer and community safety. United States v. Peep, 490 F.2d 903, 905 (8th Cir. 1974) (concluding a pat search for weapons reasonable when officers knew the defendant had bragged about shooting a police officer); State v. Gobely, 366 N.W.2d 600, 602-03 (Minn. 1985) (<HOLDING>). We are persuaded that the seizure and limited holding noknock search unconstitutional where there was no testimony or evidence that either of the suspects were violent or were known to keep weapons in their homeholding that the 2d11b1 enhancement was proper where a firearm and drugrelated items were found in the defendants residence where he had also engaged in conspiratorial conversationsholding pat search for weapons justified where defendant was in home where stolen items were found and informant reported that in at least one robbery the participants had been armedholding that a warrant authorizing the search of a residence vehicles at the residence and all persons found in the residence was not overly broad given that search was limited to places were drugs or weapons might be foundholding search of armed robbery defendants suitcases and between mattresses of hotel room proper where at time of arrest officers were aware that the defendants had used several different weapons during the robberies and that one weapon a loaded revolver was in plain view concluding officers reasonably feared that someone else was going to come to the room who knew where the other weapons were or that the defendants would position themselves to take advantage of any hidden weapons or instrumentalities & \n\nnot testify as a nonexpert fact witness about what he did and directly observed during the reenactment. Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\nStates v. Lalor, 996 F.2d 1578 (4th Cir.1993). See Opinion 2 (\"The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated that 'residential searches have been upheld only where some information links the criminal activity to the defendant\u2019s residence.' \u201d (quoting Lalor, 996 F.2d at 1583)). In Lalor, we concluded that a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s residence was not supported by probable cause. See 996 F.2d at 1583. In so doing, however, we distinguished Lalor\u2019s case from prior ones, including Suarez and Williams, wherein the nexus between criminal activity and the targeted premises was based on evidence of the suspect\u2019s drug traf ficking activities combined with the reasonable inference that drug-related evidence would be found in the suspect\u2019s home. See id. at 1582-83 (<HOLDING>); id. at 1583 (observing that, in Williams, holding a person at anothers residence solely for the purpose of engaging in drug related activity has no legitimate expectation of privacy in the residenceholding that there was sufficient probable cause to search a defendants residence after evidence of drug dealing was found in his car during a traffic stop that was conducted when the defendant was coming from his residence and noting that under such circumstances a practical commonsense conclusion could be made that the drugs and money had been at the defendants residence a short time before the stopholding that the affidavit gave absolutely no indication that the fruits of criminal activity would probably be found at that location rendering the officers belief in probable cause based solely on the affidavit objectively unreasonable recognizing that in suarez residential search upheld based on officers reasoned belief that evidence of drug activity would be found at residenceholding that a warrant authorizing the search of a residence vehicles at the residence and all persons found in the residence was not overly broad given that search was limited to places were drugs or weapons might be found & \n\nother evidence; (in) the seriousness of the litigation and the issues involved; (iv) the role of the government in the litigation; and (v) the possibility of future timidity by government employees who will be forced to recognize that their secrets are violable. Dairyland Power, 77 Fed.Cl. at 338 (quoting In re Subpoena Served Upon Comptroller of Currency, 967 F.2d 630, 634 (D.C.Cir.1992)); see also Sikorsky Aircraft, 106 Fed.Cl. at 579. B. Procedural Requirements To assert the deliberative process privilege, the government must meet several procedural requirements. First, the agency head (or her delegee) must personally consider the documents and \u201cassertf ] the privilege in the form of a declaration or affidavit.\u201d Pac. Gas, 70 Fed.Cl. at 134 n. 8; see also Marriott, 437 F.3d at 1308 (<HOLDING>). The purpose of this requirement is to ensure holding that failure to timely assert attorneyclient privilege constitutes waiverrecognizing privilegeholding that an agency may not delegate its public duties to private entitiesholding that the head of a state administrative agency was protected by executive privilege and could not be forced to appear in court and answer questions about funding of the agencyholding that an agency head may delegate authority to assert the privilege when carefully undertaken & \n\na broad interpretation of the meaning of the word \u201cdisability,\u201d and imposes a \u201cnon-onerous\u201d burden on a plaintiff at the prima facie stage. Haley v. Cmty. Mercy Health Partners, 2013 WL 322493 (S.D.Ohio Jan. 28, 2013). Even if an impairment lasts less than six months, it can be considered substantially limiting under the ADAAA. 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1630.2(j)(ix). If a plaintiff has a condition that is connected to an underlying disability, this is referred to as a \u201ccharacteristic manifestation\u201d of the qualifying impairment. Cehrs v. Ne. Ohio Alzheimer\u2019s Research Ctr., 155 F.3d 775, 780 (6th Cir.1998). The Sixth Circuit has held that a \u201ccharacteristic manifestation of [the] physical impairment [is] ... part of the underlying impairment.\u201d Roush v. Weastec, Inc., 96 F.3d 840, 844 (6th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>). Thus, to determine if Plaintiff meets the holding without applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel that the plaintiff who made sworn statements of total disability in a social security disability application and then testified at her deposition that she was not totally disabled failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether she was a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the adaholding that a plaintiffs bladder infections were connected with her disability of interstitial cystitisrecognizing that employer has notice of limitation when disability manifests itself to the extent that it would be reasonable to infer that her employer actually knew of the disabilityholding evidence of a 13 permanent partial disability insufficient to establish disability for purposes of adaholding disability discrimination claim barred & \n\n129 S.Ct. 1937. Second, to the extent there are well-pleaded factual allegations, the court should assume their truth and then determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. Id. at 679, 129 S.Ct. 1937. \u201cDetermining whether a complaint contains sufficient facts to state a plausible claim for relief will ... be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\u201d Id. \u201cWhere the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the -mere possibility of misconduct, the complaint has alleged \u2014 but it has not \u2018show[n]\u2019 \u2014 \u2018that the pleader is entitled to re or agency contracts like the one between the parties here. See, e.g., Scheerer v. Fisher, 202 N.C.App. 99, 103, 688 S.E.2d 472, 474 (2010) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, the letter agreement does not holding agreement to compensate an agent or broker for services in the buying or selling of real estate need not be in writingholding that if property description is to be supplied by writing to which reference is made in deed reference must be adequate to identify writingholding insurers oral promise to settle a claim was an original undertaking and need not be in writingholding that appellate court need not analyze and address in writing each and every argument issue or claim raised and properly before us on appealholding that a corporation could be served by delivering a copy of the subpoena to an officer or managing or general agent of the corporation and that the agent could be an individual a partnership or another corporation & \n\nwhich is to be determined from the totality of all of the circumstances. Id. at 248-49, 93 S.Ct. 2041. The voluntariness of a consent to search should be evaluated in much the same fashion as the voluntariness of a confession. Washington, 653 So.2d at 364 (\u201cAlthough a warrantless search is per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, the search will be considered lawful if conducted pursuant to consent which was given voluntarily and freely.\u201d (citing Norman v. State, 379 So.2d 643 (Fla.1980))); see also Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 223-24, 93 S.Ct. 2041 (turning to the bod urt has held that consent will be considered involuntary if given in response to a police assertion of an intent to search the premises. See Amos v. United States, 255 U.S. 313, 317, 41 S.Ct. 266, 65 L.Ed. 654 (1921) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, consent has been deemed to be holding that consent to search premises includes consent to search washing machine on those premisesholding that consent was coerced when officers told defendants wife they came to search the premises and she allowed them to enterholding that a landlord cannot validly consent to a search of a tenants apartment despite ownership and legal authority to enter the premisesholding consent involuntary when police told defendants grandmother they had a search warrant and she allowed them to enter and searchholding that a defendants consent to accompany dea agents from the detroit airport to the dea office was voluntary when she was asked to accompany the officers there were no threats or show of force and the officers told her twice that she could decline to consent & \n\nbring an individual action under \u00a7 1132(a)(3). See 516 U.S. 489, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996). Although Varity interpreted \u00a7 1132(a)(3) to authorize individual suits, its holding is not as broad as Wilson contends. The Supreme Court ruled that an individual can sue under \u00a7 1132(a)(3), but he or she must: (1) only seek equitable relief, and (2) have no more specific means of relief available. See Varity, 516 U.S. at 508-15, 116 S.Ct. 1065; Turner v. Fallon Community Health Plan, 127 F.3d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1997). Wilson\u2019s claim seeks damages in the amount of the rehabilitation expenses, not injunctive relief. Furthermore, the remedy for a claim that a plan participant\u2019s benefits were improperly denied is specifically provided for in \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). See Turner, 127 F.3d at 200 (<HOLDING>). Thus, even if Wilson amended Count V, he holding that an individual who brings a lawsuit pursuant to 1132a1b to challenge a denial of disability benefits does not also have a right to a cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty under 1132a3holding that 1132a1b affords the plaintiff adequate relief for her benefits claim and a cause of action under 1132a3 is thus not appropriateholding that action to recover erisa benefits under the subject plan are legal in nature and that plaintiff is constitutionally entitled to trial by jury on any claim raised under 1132a1bholding plaintiff had no claim under 1132a3 because his grievance that benefits were denied is specifically addressed in 1132a1bholding that no ada violation was shown because the disabled were not denied benefits that were otherwise available & \n\nnot dealing with what the law calls sexual penetration. He admits to Detective Herrick that she was defending herself. He says that his fingers may have gone in her vagina.

Jan. 4, 2007) (unpublished), this court voided a cash transfer of $300,000.00 under the Statute of Elizabeth. In deciding the issue, the court held that \u201c[b]ased on the broad language and equitable nature of the Statute ... the transfer of funds ... is a \u2018transfer\u2019 under the broad and plain language of section 27-23-10(A).\u201d Id. at *3 (citation omitted). Other courts in this district reached analogous conclusions. See In re Hanckel, 512 B.R. 539, 551 (Bankr.D.S.C.2014) (finding an ownership interest in a company subject to the statute and setting aside its transfer as a fraudulent conveyance); In re Hoffman, 194 B.R. 943, 959-61 (Bankr.D.S.C.1995) (<HOLDING>); Future Grp., II v.

See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (4), and (6). In considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and explaining the reasoning behind its choice of sentence, this Court has held that the district court need not discuss, or state that it has explicitly considered, each factor of \u00a7 3553(a). Talley, 431 F.3d at 786. Instead, this Court has held that an explicit acknowledgment that the district court has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. United States v. Scott, 426 F.3d 1324, 1329-30 (11th Cir.2005); see also Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (<HOLDING>). Here, the district court imposed a holding unconstitutional defendants sentence of death based upon the holding in roper supra and remanding for the montgomery circuit court to set aside the defendants death sentence and to sentence him to the only other sentence available life in the penitentiary without the possibility of paroleholding that the defendants sentence was reasonable when the district court considered the parties arguments and provided a reasoned basis for its choice of sentenceholding that a sentencing judge who had listened to the defendants arguments in support of a belowguidelines sentence provided sufficient explanation for rejecting those arguments when he found that the defendants circumstances were insufficient to warrant a sentence lower than the guidelines rangeholding that a sentence imposed for a violation of supervised release will be upheld where 1 the district court considered the applicable policy statements 2 the sentence is within the statutory maximum and 3 the sentence is reasonableholding that the district court which had considered the guidelines but found an upward variant sentence necessary given the defendants previous violations did not abuse its discretion when it imposed a 24month sentence instead of a guidelines range sentence of 3 to 9 months incarceration & \n\nmotive for the Challenged Laws. Before reaching that question, however, the Court notes that Defendants contend once again, in the context of Plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise claim, that housing is not eligible for free exercise protection because it is not a religious use. (See, e.g., Defs.\u2019 Mem. 2.) However, at least in the context of RLUIPA, the Court has already found that \u201cthe building of rabbinical college,\u201d of which student housing would be a part, \u201cfalls squarely within [the] definition of \u2018religious exercise,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201cthe multi-family dormitories that [Plaintiffs] seek to build are intended to facilitate religious exercise.\u201d Tartikov, 915 F.Supp.2d at 629. The same analysis is applicable here. Because the definition of religious exercise is quite broad, see WDS I, 386 F.3d at 186 (<HOLDING>), accessory housing, and particularly accessory holding exempt under ors 307130 which relates to other charitable institutions a building that was used as an office for a religious official and religious court and a printing press for a religious publicationholding that the defendant countys two denials of variance permits under the circumstances had to a significantly great extent lessened the prospect of the religious institution being able to construct a temple in the future thus imposing a substantial burden on the religious institutions religious exerciseholding rluipa claim requires prisoner to show he wishes to engage in 1 a religious exercise 2 motivated by a sincerely held belief which exercise 3 is subject to a substantial burden imposed by the governmentholding that religious exercise is any exercise of religion whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief and that the use building or conversion of real property for the purpose of religious exercise shall be considered religious exerciserecognizing a religious institutions right to free exercise of religion & \n\nand Key were unreliable because they were not asked to identify him in a photographic lineup before trial and their testimony about the appearance of the surviving assailant differed to some extent. However, Appellant did not object to the admission of this eyewitness identification evidence at trial. See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U. S. 188, 196-201 (93 SCt 375, 34 LE2d 401) (1972) (discussing the due process protection against the admission of evidence deriving from suggestive identification procedures). And it is firmly established that the determination of a witness\u2019s credibility, including eyewitness identification, is within the exclusive province of the jury. See Reeves v. State, 288 Ga. 545, 546 (705 SE2d 159) (2011). See also Walker v. State, 295 Ga. 688, 690 (763 SE2d 704) (2014) (<HOLDING>); Vega v. State, 285 Ga. 32, 33 (673 SE2d 223) holding a proffer of testimony is required to preserve the issue of whether testimony was properly excluded by the trial judge and an appellate court will not consider error alleged in the exclusion of testimony unless the record on appeal shows fairly what the excluded testimony would have beenholding that expert testimony should not be admitted as to a matter that is obviously within the common knowledge of jurors because such testimony almost by definition can be of no assistanceholding that because the special master saw the witnesses and heard the testimony he has broad discretion in determining credibilityholding that a trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to exclude testimony of a witness for an alleged sequestration violation where no impermissible harmonization of testimony could be inferred from the witnesss reading of the newspaper in the absence of any evidence that this testimony was based on what he readholding that whether and to what extent a witnesss testimony should be believed is a matter to be decided by the jury that saw and heard the testimony not by an appellate court reviewing a transcript & \n\nCourt is persuaded that the Sixth Circuit would follow this line of thinking when dealing with broad fraud allegations against contracts that contain jury trial waivers. First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\n"}

Most frequently, we admit this evidence in holding there was no rule 404b violation where the evidence was admitted to show knowledge and knowledge was an element of the crime chargedholding on a criminal appeal that prior bad acts evidence is admissible to prove intent to commit the charged crimeholding that where there is thrust upon the government either by virtue of the defense raised by the defendant or by virtue of the elements of the crime charged the affirmative duty to prove that the underlying prohibited act was done with a specific criminal intent other acts evidence may be introduced under rule 404bholding that although the specific underlying felony is an essential element of felonymurder the government is not required to include the elements of the underlying felony or state the specific means by which it alleges the defendant committed the underlying felonyholding that the rule 404b evidence admitted to prove intent was clearly relevant because intent was at issue in the trial & \n\nTo issue a certificate, FERC must determine that the public will be well-served by the company\u2019s proposed development; the Commission may also impose terms and conditions it believes the public convenience and necessity require. The Act further provides that [w]hen any holder of a certificate of public convenience and necessity cannot acquire by contract, or is unable to agree with the owner of property to the compensation to be paid [for the owner\u2019s property interests] ... it may acquire the same by the exercise of the right of eminent domain in the district court of the United States for the district in which such property may be located, or in the State courts. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 717f(h); see Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. v. An Exclusive Gas Storage Easement, 776 F.2d 125 (6th Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). The company\u2019s exercise of this eminent domain holding that floating barge moored to shore remaining in same place for approximately seven years and used as work platform to clean and strip cargo and gas from barges was not a vesselholding that the natural gas act authorizes acquisition of gas storage easements by eminent domainholding retroactive application of the act to prosecution that was pending before the effective date of the act was precluded because the act is prospectiveholding that an individual is presumed to intend the natural consequences of the individuals actionsholding that under fedrcivp 71a federal procedure governs condemnation actions brought under the natural gas act & \n\nan enforceable contract, a party must provide evidence that demonstrates that the parties reached a mutual understanding, they exchanged consideration, and they understood the essential terms of their bargain.

Morris Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, No. 04-1577, 2005 WL 3602536 (Pa.Ct. Com.Pl. Dec. 14, 2005) (<HOLDING>). Here, the Petitioning Creditor\u2019s Claim is recognizing that the elements of a claim for breach of contract are 1 existence of a valid contract and 2 breach of the terms of that contractholding failure to establish terms of an oral loan agreement precluded the existence of a breach of contract claimholding that defendant did not breach oral agreement because among other things the plaintiff had not established that the term in question was part of the oral contractholding summary dismissal of breach of implied employment contract claim inappropriate where factual issue over existence of oral policyholding part performance of an oral agreement necessary to take the oral agreement out of the statute of frauds must be consistent only with the existence of the alleged oral contract & \n\nclearly states that the precise location of an easement need not be designated for the easement to be valid. See McConnell v. Golden, 104 R.I. 657, 663, 247 A.2d 909, 912 (1968). Instead, the holders of the dominant estate are entitled to a convenient, suitable, and accessible easement of way. Id. Therefore, despite the lack of specificity in the original writing that created the easement, plaintiffs are entitled to the use of \u201ca rear roadway, at least ten feet in width,\u201d to be \u201ckept open so that vehicles can reach the rear of the building [once] known as First National Store Since this language was referenced in defendant\u2019s deed, and because it has not been modified by subsequent instrument, it remains in effect. See Crawford Realty Co. v. Ostrow, 89 R.I. 12, 19, 150 A.2d 5, 9 (1959) (<HOLDING>). There is no question that defendant caused a holding that an express easement ran with the dominant estateholding that increase in vehicular traffic arising out of the subdivision of the dominant estate was reasonably foreseeable and so did not restrict the rights of the dominant ownerrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that the dominant tenement a power company rather than the servient tenement had affirmative duties of inspection and repair related to its easementholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estate & \n\nexisting driveways and curb cuts in light of the statutory change that has affected the plaintiff\u2019s ability to use his deeded easement. This conduct is the functional equivalent of the obstruction or impairment contemplated in Sakansky and Bean. The trial court also found that the deviation proposed by the plaintiff would not unduly burden the defendant. We uphold such findings if they are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. See Batakis v. Town of Belmont, 135 N.H. 595, 597, 607 A.2d 956, 957 (1992). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Under these circumstances, the owner of the dominant estate may deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. Cf. Haley v. Colcord, 59 N.H. 7, 9 (1879) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling holding that an easement is not a separate estate when dominant and servient tracts are under the same ownershipholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estateholding that the burden on the servient estate cannot be increased without the consent of the owners of the servient estate and that the owner of the dominant estate to which the appurtenant easement is attached has no power to convey or expand use of that easement in connection with a tract of land owned by anotherrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that dominant tenant may deviate from path of prescriptive easement to extent reasonably necessary to pass around obstruction created by servient tenant & \n\nnot testify as a nonexpert fact witness about what he did and directly observed during the reenactment. Relying on several out-of-state cases, the court concluded that the relevant legal inquiry for admissibility of reenactment evidence generally is whether the reenactment was conducted under conditions substantially similar to those existing at the time of the event in question, otherwise the evidence would be excluded as irrelevant and likely to mislead the jury. See Loevsky v. Carter, 773 P.2d 1120, 1125 (Haw. 1989) (\u201c[W]hen a test or experiment is an attempt to reenact the original happening, the essential elements of the experiment must be substantially similar to those existing at the time of the accident.\u201d) (quotation omitted); State v. Leroux, 584 A.2d 778, 780-81 (N.H. 1990) (<HOLDING>). Even allowing for additional evidence offered holding that trial court could properly have found testimony explaining a videotaped reenactment was substantially more likely to mislead the jury than to be probative under rule 403holding that although the instruction at issue could have been worded more specifically the jury instructions as a whole did not mislead the jury as to the lawholding that although portion of trial courts jury charge was inapplicable any error in providing it was harmless in light of the fact that charge considered as a whole was not likely to confuse or mislead the juryholding that evidence necessary to the governments rebuttal of a defendants case could not be excluded under rule 403 but could have been if it was introduced only to bolster the prosecutions caseholding that admission of a summary chart was harmless because it was clear that the summary did not mislead the jury and the evidence introduced at trial was more than sufficient to prove the elements as to each defendant & \n\n523(a)(2)(A) claim, the creditor must prove the following [five] elements: ....\u201d), abrogated cm other grounds by Grogan v.

Forge, 458 Mich at 206 (\u201c[a]ll owners of jointly held property must sign a contract conveying an interest in the property,\u201d e.g., an easement in Forge); Slater Mgt Corp v Nash, 212 Mich App 30, 32; 536 NW2d 843 (1995) (<HOLDING>). It is undisputed that Hoover\u2019s wife, Linda, holding that the equal rights amendment requires that wife as well as husband be permitted to recover for loss of consortiumholding that the statute of frauds applies to a sellers wife holding only a dower interest in the property so the wife must sign the purchase agreement as well as the seller husbandholding a wife liable for necessary medical expenses incurred by her husband under the doctrine even though the wife did not sign as a guarantor and did not request that her husband be admitted nor anticipate that her husband would be admittedholding that a reservation clause gave a life estate to a spouse pursuant to a deed reserving use of the property to both husband and wife for life even though the husband had no interest in the propertyholding that because the wife failed to present any evidence as to the legal services performed in the trial court the wife was not entitled to a second hearing to establish attorneys fees & \n\nare you aware of whether or not Eligi\u00f3 [Saenz] has any other method of getting to a public roadway, other than through Mrs. Thrash\u2019s property and through your property? A. He\u2019s even going through my, my easement that I bought outright several times, and also through the ranch, through other places. [Emphasis added] Q. Through what other places sir? A. Through mine and Bazans and Manuel Reyes too. He\u2019s been using it, not right now because he locked the gates. [Emphasis added] Xavier Reyes\u2019 testimony raises a genuine issue of material fact on whether the Saenzes have other possible legal means of access to their property and on whether access across the Reyeses\u2019 property is a necessity, as opposed to a mere convenience. See Mitchell v. Castellaw, 151 Tex. 56, 246 S.W.2d 163, 168 (1952) (<HOLDING>). CONCLUSION We conclude the Saenzes failed to holding it is a question of factholding that whether the defendants confession was voluntary was a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo reviewholding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that probable cause determination presents a mixed question of law and factholding the question of necessity is one of mixed law and fact and accordingly one for the fact finder in the ordinary case & \n\nof interference, in the context of an easement acquired by condemnation. In Blair v. Milwaukee Elec. Ry. & Light Co., 187 Wis. 552, 556-57, 203 N.W. 912 (1925), the court held that when an electric company has a right-of-way, it has the right to make a reasonable clearance for its wires by cutting down and trimming trees. \"To hold otherwise,\" the court noted, \"would be to jeopardize the efficient operation of the line and perhaps to subject to greater peril the public or those who may have occasion to be on or near the wires, for it is a well known fact that, especially in wet weather, trees touching high-voltage electric wires transmit the current to the ground, where it may do damage to persons or property.\" Id.; see also Klump v. Cybulski, 274 Wis. 604, 613-14, 81 N.W.2d 42 (1957) (<HOLDING>). The reasoning of these cases leads us to holding that the court must determine rights in condemnation ujnless there is found in the deed of the plaintiffs granting the easement to the railroad company language indicating a purpose or operating to pass a larger or more extended right or easement than that which would have been acquired by judgment in condemnation proceedings holding the easement a power company acquires by condemnation may include the right to cut down trees to provide sufficient clearance for its wiresholding that permanent easement arising from condemnation of pipeline easement reduced property value by 20recognizing that an easement may entitle the easement owner to do acts which were not for the easement would constitute a nuisanceholding that when federal government acquires property through condemnation it must account for state and local property taxes interest and penalties & \n\nby a plausible basis in the record. Secretary\u2019s Br. at 7-8. Furthermore, the Secretary argues that a remand for readjudication in light of the enactment of the VCAA is not required because \u201cthe record fails to reveal the necessity for additional development ... [and the a]ppellant has been given adequate notice which detailed the law and evidence necessary to establish his claim.\u201d Secretary\u2019s Br. at 10. In his reply, the appellant argues that the BVA decision should be vacated and the matters remanded because of \u201cthe Board\u2019s failure to make a finding on the question of whether the VCAA applies.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply at 1. Initially, the Court notes that it will address only those arguments adequately raised by the appellant in his briefs. See Ford v. Gober, 10 Vet.App. 531, 535-36 (1997) (<HOLDING>); Grivois v. Brown, 6 Vet.App. 136, 138 (1994); holding that the court has discretion not to consider an issue abandoned on appealholding that an issue not presented to the trial court will not be considered on appealholding that claims presented to bva and not pursued on appeal are considered abandonedholding that issues not argued on appeal are deemed abandonedholding that a deposition that was not presented to the trial court could not be considered on appeal & \n\nthat? (Tr. at 152.) Carter argues the quote is a misstatement of the law, and improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case. The State indicates the prosecutor was \"verifying that the jurors could go outside what might be called the typical paradigm of a robbery ease.\" (Appellee's Br. at 11.) As we find the statement extremely difficult to understand, we cannot say it could have improperly persuaded the jury to be receptive to the State's case or otherwise prejudiced the jury against Carter. Even if the statement could be understood to misstate the law, it did not make a fair trial impossible, as the jury was instructed multiple times thereafter regarding the elements of the charges against Carter. See Benefield v. State, 904 N.E.2d 239, 247 n. 4 (Ind.Ct.App.2009) (<HOLDING>), trans. denied. There was no prose-cutorial holding almost any improper argument may be cured by an instruction to disregardholding improper admission of extrinsic evidence may be cured by adequate limiting instructionholding an error re garding the element of a crime may be cured through further instruction to the juryholding that a jury instruction directing the verdict on one element deprived defendant of the right to a jury determination on every element of the charged offense and thus constituted structural errorholding omission in the jury instruction of element of offense requires a new trial & \n\nState made no effort to distinguish Cox; in fact, the State\u2019s brief does not even cite Cox. As previously discussed, the State was required to prove that when Phares induced Daniel Walker to pay him money, Phares intended to unlawfully deprive Walker of the money, ie., to take the money without performing the agreed-upon work. See Tex. Pen.Code Ann. \u00a7 31.01(3)(A), \u00a7 31.03(a); see also Wilson v. State, 663 S.W.2d 834, 836-37 (Tex.Crim.App.1984) (To prove theft, the State must show intent to deprive the complainant of property at the time the appellant accepted remuneration pursuant to the contract.). On this record, there is no evidence from which such a deceptive intent can be inferred. See Cox, 658 S.W.2d at 669-71; see also Phillips v. State, 640 S.W.2d 293, 294 (Tex.Crim.App.1982) (<HOLDING>). As in Cox and Phillips, in the case sub holding that a paywhenpaid clause does not preclude a subcontractors recovery under the miller act payment bond because the federal legislation conditions payment of the subcontractor not on payment by the government to the contractor but rather on the passage of time from completion of the work or provision of materialsholding that an assignment was recognized by the government because the government issued a check made payable to the assignee as payment under the contractholding that payment made in reasonable belief that it was required by an insurance contract was involuntaryholding that when the appellant and the complainants entered into a residential construction contract the complainants made a down payment and the defendant took measurements drew up plans but ultimately failed to perform under the contract the evidence was insufficient to show that the defendant obtained the down payment by deceptionholding that it was not essential to an action by a supplier on a payment bond under the miller act that a demand be made on the general contractor for payment although there was evidence in the case from which it could be found that the materialman looked to the general contractor for payment since the statute does not require a demand for payment but merely requires written notice of the claim & \n\na comparison of Lentz\u2019s handwriting exemplars with the questioned handwritten documents in the government\u2019s possession would have revealed that Lentz was indeed the author of the questioned documents. Although the Fourth Circuit has not squarely addressed this issue, published authority from other circuits is divided on this question, but the better reasoned, ap posite decisions favor Lentz\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d argument over the government\u2019s \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d argument in the circumstances presented here. To be sure, several circuits have allowed the government to present evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to provide a handwriting exemplar as evidence of that defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt for the offense charged, as the government here requests. See, e.g., Askew, 584 F.2d at 963 (<HOLDING>). These decisions, however, are inapposite, as holding that while the government was required to prove that the defendants phone call crossed a state line the government did not need to prove that the defendant knew of the interstate nexusholding in a prosecution for the interstate transportation of forged securities that the government was permitted to prove and comment on a defendants refusal to produce exemplars as tending to prove his guilt of the offense chargedrecognizing the right of a defendant to comment upon the failure of the state to produce evidenceholding due process clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the charged offense and new york law that requires the defendant in a second degree murder prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter when no element of the charged offense is presumed does not violate the due process clauseholding that the government need not prove that interstate transport was foreseeable in order to obtain a conviction under 18 usc 2314 which prohibits the interstate transportation of stolen goods & \n\n23 S.W.3d at 485.

Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla.

See State v. Lewis, 656 So.2d 1248 (Fla.1994) (stating that a judge may not be examined as to his or her thought process in making a decision); Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles v. Marks, 898 So.2d 1063 (Fla. 5th DCA 2005) (<HOLDING>). We can draw the same analogy to the holding order of contempt sentence without statutory opportunity for appeal was in error but nevertheless involved a judicial act subject to judicial immunityrecognizing that absolute judicial immunity is not grounded in any special esteem for those who perform judicial functions and certainly not from a desire to shield abuses of office but because any lesser degree of immunity could impair the judicial process itselfholding that individuals acting in a legislative capacity at a regional level are entitled to absolute immunityholding that a hearing officer acting in a judicial capacity was entitled to claim judicial immunity and could not be compelled to give testimony about his mental process in deciding a caserecognizing judicial immunity for acts committed within their judicial jurisdiction & \n\n96 S.Ct. 984. However, \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s administrative duties and those investigatory functions that do not relate to an advocate\u2019s preparation for the initiation of a prosecution or for judicial proceedings are not entitled to absolute immunity.\u201d Buckley, 509 U.S. at 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606. A defendant pleading absolute immunity bears the burden of showing that it is justified by the function in question. Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 487, 111 S.Ct. 1934, 114 L.Ed.2d 547 (1991). The defendants\u2019 argument that they are entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity prevails only in part. They are correct that they have absolute immunity for offering the tape recording into evidence at the hearing because in doing so they were functioning as advocates. See Imbler, 424 U.S. at 431, 96 S.Ct. 984 (<HOLDING>); see also Butz, 438 U.S. at 516-517, 98 S.Ct. holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity from 1983 suits for initiating a prosecution and presenting the case at trialholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding prosecutors immune from civil suits for initiating prosecutions and presenting casesholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nnot to place the tapes in the investigation file, depends upon the function he was performing at the time the conduct occurred. He is absolutely immune from liability for damages if he was gathering evidence to present to the trier of fact. See Ybarra, 723 F.2d at 679. Bogan and Ingram would be protected only by qualified immunity, however, if they were conducting an investigation to determine whether probable cause existed to arrest Broam and Manning. See, e.g., Powers v. Coe, 728 F.2d 97, 103 (2d Cir.1984) (determining that, \u201cwhen a prosecutor engages in or authorizes and directs illegal wiretaps\u201d and \u201cthe wiretapping is ... investigative in nature,\u201d the prosecutors are only \u201centitled to qualified, rather than absolute, immunity\u201d); Jacobson v. Rose, 592 F.2d 515, 524 (9th Cir.1978) (<HOLDING>); Guerro v. Mulhearn, 498 F.2d 1249, 1255-56 holding officers engaged in search entitled to immunityholding that a judge was not entitled to absolute immunity for firing an employeeholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that when prosecutors joined in implementing the wiretap they engaged in an act that was ordinarily related to police activity and were not entitled to absolute immunityholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nabsolutely immune from damages liability under \u00a71983 for this conduct. Relying on its decision in Salyer v. Patrick, 874 F. 2d 374 (CA6 1989), the Court of Appeals affirmed. I would grant certiorari to address petitioner\u2019s challenge to that ruling. In Salyer, the Sixth Circuit held that, \u201cdue to their quasiprosecutorial function in the initiation of child abuse proceedings,\u201d social workers are absolutely immune from liability for filing juvenile abuse petitions. Id., at 378. Other courts addressing the question have agreed that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity under \u00a7 1983 in some instances, depending on their conduct and the terms of the state laws pursuant to which they acted. See, e. g., Meyers v. Contra Costa County Dept. of Social Servs., 812 F. 2d 1154, 1157 (CA9) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 484 U. S. 829 (1987); Vosburg holding that social services attorneys were entitled to absolute immunity for actions related to the prosecution of child neglect and delinquency proceedingsholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity when prosecuting child delinquency petitionsholding that state prosecutors enjoy absolute immunity for the initiation and pursuit of a criminal prosecutionholding that social workers are entitled to absolute immunity in performing quasiprosecutorial functions connected with the initiation and pursuit of child dependency proceedingsholding that child social workers are entitled to absolute immunity for their actions on behalf of the state in preparing for initiating and prosecuting dependency hearings as well as the formulation and presentation of recommendations to the court in the course of such proceedings & \n\nover other attorneys, settled tort cases only pursuant to directives he received from an internal management committee, and never participated in any forum wherein departmental policy was discussed and\/or established. The defendants\u2019 reliance on a string of cases holding that municipal attorneys in positions similar to Selkirk\u2019s were not protected by Elrod and Branti, is irrelevant and misplaced. The very essence of the following cases required an examination of the duties of each plaintiff to ascertain whether his position entailed \u201cpolicymak-ing\u201d responsibility or required political fealty to effectively perform. The Court need not undertake such an analysis here because the Defendants have already done so and concluded to the contrary. See Livas v. Petka, 711 F.2d 798 (7th Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); Mummau v. Ranck, 687 F.2d 9 (3rd Cir. 1982) holding that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute immunity from a civil suit for damages under 1988 in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the states case including deciding which evidence to presentholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding absolute immunity protects prosecutor from liability for withholding exculpatory evidence from grand juryholding that nasd disciplinary officers are entitled to absolute immunity from further prosecution for civil liability for them actions taken within the outer scope of them official dutiesholding in dicta that a prosecutor is entitled to absolute loyalty from his assistants and could terminate them for political reasons & \n\napparent on the statute\u2019s face and the question of their enforcement duties, if any, was not considered in the decision declaring the statutes unconstitutional, nor were the merits of the proposition otherwise litigated. Moreover, where, as here, the state defendants include members of the judiciary who \u201cenjoy absolute immunity from damages liability for acts performed in their judicial eapaeitie[s],\u201d Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union, 446 U.S. at 735, 100 S.Ct. at 1976, it is particularly important to give careful consideration as to whether liability is properly based upon the exercise of their enforcement authority since imposition of a fees award might be erroneously premised upon acts or omissions as to which the defendants are immune. See id. at 738, 100 S.Ct. at 1977 (<HOLDING>). Unquestionably, with respect to the holding trial court had no authority to award attorneys fees when arbitrator had stated he would not award attorneys feesholding that a district court may award attorneys fees while the merits are on appealholding merely that the evidence was sufficient to support the award of attorneys feesholding that an award of attorneys fees under supreme court rule 38 precursor to rule 222 did not preempt an award of attorneys fees to which one is otherwise entitled and thus appellant could seek an award of attorneys fees pursuant to section 1577300 which permits an award of fees for a party prevailing in an action against a state agencyholding district jourts award of attorneys fees was erroneous since court relied upon a theory of liability under which defendants had immunity & \n\nwould in itself be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to criminal or civil statutes.\u201d Doe v. McMillan, 412 U.S. 306, 312-13, 93 S.Ct. 2018, 36 L.Ed.2d 912 (1973) (citation omitted). Before defendants in the instant case can invoke legislative immunity, they have the burden of establishing both of the following: (1) that the acts giving rise to the harm alleged in the complaint were undertaken when defendants were acting in their legislative capacities under the functional test set forth in Bogan; and (2) that the particular relief sought would enjoin defendants in their legislative capacities, and not in some other capacity in which they would not be entitled to legislative immunity. See State Emp., 494 F.3d at 89; see also Canary v. Osborn, 211 F.3d 324, 328 (6th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Here, Defendants argue that by issuing the holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the burden is on the plaintiffholding that city council is entitled to absolute legislative immunity from claim under the age discrimination in employment actholding that the burden is on defendant as the party invoking removal jurisdiction to establish the existence of a sufficient amount in controversyholding that prosecutors have absolute immunity & \n\nphase of the criminal process.\u201d Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). A prosecutor is granted only qualified immunity, however, if he or she is performing investigatory or administrative functions, or is essentially functioning as a police officer or detective. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, 273, 113 S.Ct. 2606, 125 L.Ed.2d 209 (1993). A court may grant a Cir.1978) (per curiam) (extending absolute immunity to a prosecutor\u2019s actions in \u201cinitiating and pursuing a criminal prosecution and in presenting the state\u2019s case ... even where the prosecutor knowingly used perjured testimony, deliberately withheld exculpatory information, or failed to make full disclosure of all facts\u201d); Hilliard v. Williams, 540 F.2d 220, 221 (6th Cir.1976) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>) (quoting Hilliard v. Williams, 516 F.2d 1344, holding that a prosecutors decision whether or not to give defense counsel evidence alleged to be materially exculpatory which was either discovered after the 1983 plaintiffs arrest but before his conviction or while the prosecutor was still functioning as an advocate for the state in posttrial motions and preparations for appeal is clearly part of the presentation of the states case and therefore a prosecutor is absolutely immune from liability for failure to turn over evidenceholding prosecutor absolutely immune from suit for deciding to investigate and conspir ing to present false charges to the grand juryholding that a prosecutor is absolutely immune from a suit claiming that he destroyed and falsified evidenceholding that notwithstanding acts and omissions of state prosecutor in withholding certain information and in failing to prevent or correct deceptive and misleading testimony deprived the state defendant of her constitutional right to a fair trial prosecutor was absolutely immuneholding prosecutor absolutely immune for deciding to pursue criminal charges despite challenge to his motivation & \n\nclaims. This immunity applies to the section 1983 claims. Individual immunity is not necessary for the RLUIPA claims. RLUIPA provides a cause of action against \u201cgovernments\u201d and does not appear to allow causes of action against individuals. (A section 1983 claim' against an individual could be based upon a denial of such a statutory right (see Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 4, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980)), but such a claim would be a section 1983 claim, not an individual RLUIPA claim.) In any event, to the extent Plaintiffs assert or can assert a claim against individual defendants in their personal capacities specifically under RLUIPA, the Court would find the same immunity and such claims are dismissed. See Mishler v. Clift, 191 F.3d 998, 1002 (9th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>) (citing Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259, holding that as a general rule interlocutory trial court orders rejecting defenses of common law sovereign immunity governmental immunity public official immunity statutory immunity or any other type of immunity are not appealable under the maryland collateral order doctrineholding that prosecutors have absolute immunityholding trial court improperly granted dismissal on ground of immunity because the defendant had qualified statutory immunity rather than absolute immunityholding that qualified immunity is not merely immunity from damages but also immunity from suitrecognizing that absolute immunity is immunity from charges of either constitutional or statutory violations & \n\nfor the State. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 430 94 (\u201cWe can see no substantial difference between the function of the agency attorney in presenting evidence in an agency hearing and the function of the prosecutor who brings evidence before a court.\u201d). Moreover, the absolute immunity the defendants enjoy for offering the composite tape into evidence is not defeated by Cig-netti\u2019s allegations that they did so maliciously or in bad-faith because they knew or should have known that the composite tape was fabricated. See e.g. Imbler, 424 U.S. at 409, 96 S.Ct. 984 (concluding that absolute prosecutorial immunity precluded a \u00a7 1983 claim alleging that a prosecutor had knowingly used perjured testimony and deliberately suppressed exculpatory material at trial); Burns, 500 U.S. at 478, 111 S.Ct. 1934 (<HOLDING>); see also Kulwicki v. Dawson, 969 F.2d 1454, holding that an officer applying for a warrant without probable cause may be entitled to qualified immunity but is not entitled to absolute immunityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding prosecutor had absolute immunity for claim for eliciting misleading testimony in a probable cause hearingholding that prosecutor retained absolute immunity despite allegations of witness intimidation in attempt to suppress testimonyholding that a prosecutor accused of knowingly presenting false testimony at trial is protected by absolute immunity & \n\nthe conduct, \u201cif performed in other than legislative lations, they were fulfilling discretionary, policymaking functions implicating State budgetary priorities. As discussed supra, Plaintiffs claim that defendants acts were ultra vires, without authority, and null and void. Taking the allegations in the complaint as true, as the Court must do on a motion to dismiss, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged that Defendants were acting beyond the scope of their authority as public officials. Drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the Court finds that the allegations are sufficiently pled to defeat Defendants\u2019 motion at this stage of the litigation. See Collin Cnty. Tex. v. Homeowners Ass\u2019n for Values Essential to Neighborhoods (HAVEN), 654 F.Supp. 943, 949 (N.D.Tex.1987) (<HOLDING>). At this stage of the litigation, based upon holding that the burden is on the defendants to establish the existence of absolute legislative immunityholding that the plaintiffs allegations that the defendants actions were ultra vires in character and that they acted outside of their capacities as public officials arguably deprives the defendants of rule 12b6 dismissal based upon an absolute immunity defenseholding that a plaintiffs breach of contract claim failed because he could make no showing that the individual defendants acted in their individual capacities when they signed the contract on behalf of the employer housing authorityholding that while a witness and prosecutor were protected by absolute immunity for their participation in judicial proceedings they were not entitled to absolute immunity on a 1983 claim that they conspired to present false testimonyholding that the public policy considerations supporting public officials immunity required that the immunity be applied to bar contribution actions as well as direct actions & \n\nand ministerial acts in its application of the qualified public official immunity doctrine. See, e.g., Parker v. State, 337 Md. 271, 284, 653 A.2d 436, 442 (1995) (noting that \u201cthe Court has distinguished between the qualified and narrower immunity for discretionary acts generally accorded to public officials, and absolute judicial immunity, which ... applies [to judges] regardless of the nature of the tort\u201d (emphasis added)); Mandel, 320 Md. at 110, 576 A.2d at 769 (recognizing that \u201c \u2018the Maryland cases seem to indicate that discretionary action [of officials] will be protected only in the absence of malice\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting Eliason v.

Critically, we have repeatedly acknowledged the limited reach of this tort and indicated that a plaintiff seeking recovery thereunder must show that her protected activity was the predominant cause of her termination. See Wallace v.

Further, although the Consent Form generally allowed defendant to make unilateral changes to any of its policies, the arbitration policy was explicitly excluded from this provision: \u201cI agree and understand that AIMCO has the right to and may modify, rescind or cancel all or any part of these policies, or add new rules of conduct, at any time, in its sole discretion ... except the Arbitration policy, which can only be amended by AIMCO\u2019s and my mutual agreement.\u201d Because an employer\u2019s unilateral act of making changes to an employment handbook does not constitute mutual consent, the court finds that the arbitration agreement is still in full force. Robinson v. Ada S. McKinley Comm. Services, Inc., 19 F.3d 359, 364 (7th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). Because the arbitration agreement is still in holding that an arbitration agreement in an employee handbook was illusory where the employer expressly reserved a right to unilaterally rescind any provisions of the handbookholding that contractual relationship between student and university did not include terms of the handbook because university retained right to unilaterally modify terms of handbook without notice plaintiff neither negotiated for nor assented to terms of contract and relevant correspondence did not call special attention to handbookholding that no modification of the original employment contract occurred when the employer unilaterally issued a new handbookholding that an agreement to arbitrate is illusory if as here the employer can unilaterally modify the contractholding that employee handbook did not give rise to implied contract where it stated that it was not a contract and that employment was terminable at will & \n\nexpert witness, testified that the existence of an annual renewable employment agreement between the Foundation and D\u2019Unger was consistent with generally accepted accounting practices and corporate governance standards regarding how corporate officers are employed and compensated. The Foundation\u2019s by-laws provide that \u201c[ejection or appointment of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract rights.\u201d In light of that evidence, D\u2019Un-ger\u2019s testimony about his understanding of the one-year, renewable term of his employment with the Foundation, standing alone, will not support a finding that the Foundation agreed to an employment contract that limited its right to terminate D\u2019Unger. See Williams v. First Tenn. Nat\u2019l Corp., 97 S.W.3d 798, 804 (Tex.App.Dallas 2003, no pet.) (<HOLDING>). D\u2019Unger was required to present probative holding that language in employee handbook stating that it was not to be considered as creating terms and conditions of an employment contract and that the employment relationship was employment atwill was sufficiently explicit to preclude the creation of implied contractual obligations as a matter of lawholding where employee handbook and employment offer letter disclaimed creation of employment contract that employees testimony of his understanding of terms of agreement did not raise fact issue of specific express and clear agreement contradicting the express provisions of the personnel manual and the employment offer letterholding offer of continued atwill employment did not constitute consideration for the arbitration agreementholding that under arkansas law employment is atwill unless personnel manual or employment agreement contains express provision that employee shall not be discharged except for causeholding that whether a personnel policy manual modifies an employment contract is a question of fact & \n\nwhich he likens to the more familiar terms \u201cfor just cause\u201d or \u201cfor cause,\u201d which remove employment from the at-will category. The School District does not dispute that \u00a7 20.7(3) is applicable to Lockhart, but does contend that Lockhart is nonetheless an at-will employee. Quite surprisingly, no reported Iowa decision has directly addressed the issue of whether \u00a7 20.7(3) negates the presumption of at-will employment for the public employees and employers covered under this provision of the Iowa Public Employment Relations Act. The few cases that have specifically addressed \u00a7 20.7(3) deal with its interaction with other statutory provisions involving discharge of public teachers. See, e.g., Northeast Community Educ. Ass\u2019n v. Northeast Community Sch. Dist., 402 N.W.2d 765, 770 (Iowa 1987) (<HOLDING>); McFarland v. Board of Educ., 277 N.W.2d 901, holding that a collective bargaining agreement between school board and teachers union established a teachers legitimate claim of entitlement to their positions at elementary schoolholding that 2073 was not inconsistent with the provision regarding the discharge of a teacher employed by public schools iowa code 27927recognizing application of sovereign immunity to school districtsholding that 2073 expressly grants school districts the power to suspend teachers for proper cause for disciplinary reasons provided an iowa code 27927 discharge proceeding has been initiatedholding that the district was not liable under respondeat superior for a teachers sexual assault of a student even though it occurred on school grounds and during school hours because the criminal misconduct was not within the scope of the teachers employment & \n\nof the changes, he has accepted the changes as a matter of law.\u201d Hathaway v. General Mills, Inc., 711 S.W.2d 227, 229 (Tex. 1986). {15} It appears that the district court assumed, without deciding, that under Texas law Flemma would be deemed to have accepted the terms of the Program. We agree with Defendants that, under Texas law, mutual assent and acceptance of the Program and hence an agreement to arbitrate existed between Halliburton and Flemma. Flemma does not argue otherwise. {16} Asa Halliburton employee living and working in T exas when notice of the Program was initially sent to his address, Flemma\u2019s continued employment constituted acceptance of the terms of the Program, including the arbitration requirement under Texas law. See In re Halliburton Co., 80 S.W.3d at 568-69 (<HOLDING>). Halliburton subsequently reaffirmed the offer holding the employee had 180 days to file a claim from the date the employee received final definitive and unequivocal notice of an adverse employment actionholding that language in employee handbook stating that it was not to be considered as creating terms and conditions of an employment contract and that the employment relationship was employment atwill was sufficiently explicit to preclude the creation of implied contractual obligations as a matter of lawholding that an employee accepted as a matter of law changes to an employment agreement by continuing employment with the company after he received notice of the changesholding covenant in an employment agreement executed some 12 years after the initial taking of employment was not incident to the taking of employmentholding that reassignments without salary or work changes do not ordinarily constitute adverse employment decisions in employment discrimination claims & \n\nJersey Racing Comm\u2019n, 113 F.3d 1313, 1318 (3d Cir. 1997) (\u201cIn order to succeed on a claim of deprivation of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to termination of a specific employment position, a plaintiff must first establish a property interest in the employment.\u201d) (citing Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L.

Twp. of Readington, 39 Fed. Appx. 774, 775-76 (3d Cir. 2002) 1987) (<HOLDING>). The burden thus shifts to Davis to show that holding that court erred as matter of law in failing to enter judgment for employer at close of plaintiffs implied employment contract actionholding that once the plaintiffs fixed term of employment expired he had no property interest as a matter of lawholding that plaintiffs had no vested interest in former interpretation of state lawholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that an assistant professor hired for a fixed term of one academic year had no property interest in his job because the terms of his employment allowed that his contract not be renewed & \n\nagreement. Where, as here, the Offer Letter specifies benefits payable on discharge, the employee is entitled to those benefits if the termination amounts to a constructive discharge. See Robinson v. Kingston Hosp., 55 A.D.3d 1121, 1122, 866 N.Y.S.2d 387, 388 (3d Dep\u2019t 2008) (observing that, despite plaintiff\u2019s being at-will employee, change in employment terms would entitle her to contractual severance benefits if it amounted to constructive discharge). In rejecting Scott\u2019s claim of constructive discharge and accepting Harris\u2019s claim of resignation, the district court concluded, as a matter of law, that a salary in the reduced amount of $150,000 could not be deemed so abusive as to render continued employment untenable. See Pena v. Brat-tleboro Retreat, 702 F.2d 322, 325 (2d Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>); accord Morris v. Schroder Capital Mgmt. holding that plaintiff alleging constructive discharge must prove deliberateness of the employers action and intolerability of the working conditionsrecognizing constructive discharge where employer rather than acting directly deliberately makes employees working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee would be forced into involuntary resignationrecognizing doctrine of constructive discharge under federal civil rights act and national labor relations act where employer knowingly permits working conditions to become so intolerable that a reasonable person subject to them would resignholding employee resigned and was not constructively discharged because there was no evidence that employer deliberately created working conditions that led to her resignationholding that defendant interfered with plaintiffs right when the employer forced her to choose between resignation and working without leave & \n\nfor sum mary judgment that the plaintiff does not have a vested right or property interest in the position of municipal judge. Although in his Original Petition the plaintiff alleges in a conclusory fashion that he was a public employee working pursuant to a contract of employment, the plaintiff fails to allege any facts to indicate that a contract of employment existed and further fails to provide any competent summary judgment evidence to support this allegation. The City of Was-kom\u2019s ordinance provides that the term of office of the municipal judge shall be by appointment of the City Council by a majority vote of the governing body. The City\u2019s ordinance does not appear to create a contract of employment. See Youngblood v. City of Galveston, 920 F.Supp. 10B (S.D.Tex. 1996) (<HOLDING>). The plaintiff does not even allege that the holding that plaintiff did not have dueprocessprotected property interest because he failed to sufficiently plead a rule or other mutually explicit understanding from the manual or otherwise bridling the reason for which he could be terminated and thereby creating a sufficient expectation of continued employment the critical component herewithout alleging such a bridle plaintiff was an atwill employee consequently he lacked a property interest in his continued employmentholding that former municipal judge did not have property interest in continued employmentholding that plaintiffs may have a property interest in real propertyholding that property interest in continued expectation of public employment does not include right to actually occupy positionholding an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was insufficient to create a property interest in continued employment under montanas statutory scheme for at will employment & \n\nfiled a complaint against Guest Services, Inc., alleging that her discharge was wrongful. Ms. Washington claimed that her co-worker\u2019s conduct in spraying the food with cleaning fluid contravened applicable District of Columbia health and food regulations, and that Guest Services had dismissed her (Ms. Washington) \u201cfor protesting safety, health, and food code violations on the part of the defendant.\u201d On June 17, 1996, Guest Services filed a motion for summary judgment. Guest Services argued that Ms. Washington was an at-will employee and that her allegations, even if true, did not bring her within the only public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine that had been recognized by this court at the time. See Adams v. George W. Cochran & Co., 597 A.2d 28, 34 (D.C.1991) (<HOLDING>). On July 23, 1996, the trial judge granted holding that an atwill employee may not be discharged for refusal to violate the lawholding that an atwill employee may bring a cause of action under section 1981holding that an atwill employee can be discharged for any reason or no reason unless employee is discharged for reasons that contravene a clear mandate of public policyholding that absent a law or collective bargaining agreement a municipal employee is an employee atwillholding that an atwill employee may not recover for discriminatory discharge under section 1981 because the atwill relationship was not sufficiently contractual under tennessee law & \n\nto the Petitioning Creditor. Despite this acknowledgement, this Court finds the Instant Memo to be insufficient to prove the existence of an enforceable contract because it makes no reference to the essential terms of whatever loan agreement that may exist between the parties. Mackay v. Mackay, 984 A.2d 529, 534 (Pa.Super.2009) (recognizing that when a party seeks to enforce an oral agreement, the party must establish the essential terms and conditions of the alleged agreement); CoreStates Bank, N.A. v.

Morris Chapel Missionary Baptist Church, No. 04-1577, 2005 WL 3602536 (Pa.Ct.Com.Pl. Dec. 14, 2005) (<HOLDING>). For example, the Instant Memo makes no recognizing that the elements of a claim for breach of contract are 1 existence of a valid contract and 2 breach of the terms of that contractholding part performance of an oral agreement necessary to take the oral agreement out of the statute of frauds must be consistent only with the existence of the alleged oral contractholding that defendant did not breach oral agreement because among other things the plaintiff had not established that the term in question was part of the oral contractholding summary dismissal of breach of implied employment contract claim inappropriate where factual issue over existence of oral policyholding failure to establish terms of an oral loan agreement precluded the existence of a breach of contract claim & \n\nwithin the meaning of the statute; (2) that the [employer] had notice of his disability; (3) that with reasonable accommodation he could perform the essential functions of the position ...; and (4) that the employer refused to make such accommodations.\u201d Rhoads v.

The Complaint here fails to state a cause of action. Although attorney honesty and fidelity are vital to the legal system and a matter in the public interest, we do not believe that a former law firm employee can be immune from the general rule of at-will employment merely by complaining to the Firm and its attorneys prior to being fired about deceitful but seemingly legal billing practices he no longer wishes to participate in. While we do not condone the Firm\u2019s alleged misconduct here, we are not persuaded that plaintiffs allegation of \u201chonesty and fidelity\u201d in the legal system satisfies the supreme court\u2019s \u201cnarrow definition of public policy\u201d in retaliatory discharge cases. Id. at 507-08 (<HOLDING>). We affirm the dismissal of the Complaint. holding that based on the narrow scope of a retaliatory discharge action the general concept of patient safety by itself is simply inadequate to justify finding an exception to the general rule of atwill employmentholding that an atwill employee who alleges retaliatory discharge for the filing of a workers compensation claim has stated a cause of action under pennsylvania lawrecognizing the tort of retaliatory dischargerecognizing general rulerecognizing narrow whistleblower exception to the atwill doctrine & \n\nthe employee was invited to an employer-sponsored dinner meeting. After attending the meeting, while on her way home, the employee was severely injured in an automobile accident. After accepting the Commission\u2019s finding that the employee had been required to attend the dinner, the court held the em ployee\u2019s journey was covered under the special mission exception: Here, claimant was attending an off-premises dinner meeting, after normal working hours, under at least the implied direction of her employer, and travel to and from the meeting was a necessity. These special circumstances justify the Commission\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s injuries while returning from the meeting were compensable. Id. at 916. See also Brown v. City of Wheeling, 212 W.Va. 121, 569 S.E.2d 197, 203 (2002) (<HOLDING>); State of Utah (Tax Commission) v.

The general test to resolve this question employs the following factors: 1) the form and manner of the employment contract concerning provisions of full-time or part-time employment; 2) whether the employment contract provides for vacation time, sick leave, or a retirement program; 3) the extent an nature of control the individual has over the execution of his duties; 4) the form of payment; and 5) the ownership status of equipment which is utilized. Rivera v. Hospital Universitario, 762 F.Supp. at 17. No one factor, by itself, is sufficient to establish an individual as an independent contractor. Id. In fact, it is unusual to find cases where the distinction between an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d and an employee is crystal clear. Nazario v. Gonzalez, 101 D.P.R. 569, 572 (1973) (<HOLDING>). In Landr\u00f3n v.

Further, it is well-settled that \u201c[a] party is bound by, and a court is powerless to rewrite, the clear and unambiguous terms of a voluntary contract.\u201d Brooks v. Green, 993 So.2d 58, 61 (Fla. 1st DCA 2008). This principle applies even where the terms of the contract are \u201charsh\u201d or \u201cout of the ordinary.\u201d Id. at 61. (citations omitted). In addition, to give proper meaning to a specific contract provision, a court must consider it in the context of the entire contract. Hand, 983 So.2d at 687. When an employment agreement contains a noncompete covenant, the restriction survives the termination of the agreement if the agreement contains express language demonstrating that the parties intended its survival. Brenner v. Barco Chems. Div., Inc., 209 So.2d 277, 278 (Fla. 3d DCA 1968) (<HOLDING>).

Again, this is a matter of both fairness and common sense. To state a claim of direct infringement, a complaint need allege no more than what is required by Form 18. Confronted with such a claim, a defendant seeking a declaration of noninfringement can hardly be expected to plead facts supporting such a judgment in much detail. The defendant can do little more, at the pleading stage, than deny the plaintiffs allegations.

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements.

First, the court has held unequivocally that a contract action asserting fraud in the inducement is not sufficient to implicate an arbitration clause where there is no claim of fraud specifically relating to that clause. Highlands Wellmont Health Network, Inc. v. John Deere Health Plan, Inc., 350 F.3d 568, 575-76 (6th Cir.2003). Second, in the case of parties with equal bargaining power, the court has not hesitated to find that an agreement to waive a jury trial can satisfy the requirement that constitutional rights can be waived if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made. K.M.C., 757 F.2d at 756 (<HOLDING>). Third, the court has relied on the rationale holding that the court must determine whether the employees consent to the settlement agreement was knowing and voluntaryholding that a defendant must have knowledge of the likely consequences of entering the guilty plea in order for a plea to be voluntary and knowingholding that the magistrate was correct in applying the knowing and voluntary standard in this instanceholding that a guilty plea must be both knowing and voluntary and must be a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action available to a defendantholding a waiver of a substantial constitutional right must be a voluntary knowing and intelligent act & \n\nto Officer Rucker, \"[h]e could have had money and you wouldn\u2019t have\" found it. 10 .

A few of the Defendants make a final argument concerning the container in which the salt was transported. This argument is baseless and not supported by the allegations.

DISCUSSION The denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate presents a mixed question of law and fact, and we review the district judge\u2019s factual conclusions for clear error and questions of law de novo. Rhode v. United States, 583 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam). Pro se pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by attorneys and, consequently, must be construed liberally. Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). District judges must resolve all claims for relief raised in habeas proceedings, regardless of whether relief is granted or denied. Clisby, 960 F.2d at 935-36 (involving a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition filed by a state prisoner); Rhode, 583 F.3d at 1291 (<HOLDING>). When a district judge fails to address all of holding 2254 applies to administrative proceedingsholding that 60day time limit for notice of appeal in civil cases not 10day limit in criminal cases applies to 2255 proceedingsholding that exclusionary rule applies to civil forfeiture proceedingsholding that res judicata applies in deportation proceedingsholding clisby applies to 2255 proceedings & \n\nthat only rules of damages are substantive. Prior to Monessen, the United States Supreme Court had already decided that prejudgment interest is a form of \u201cactual damages\u201d and that damages are substantive. See id. Thus, no further analysis was needed to determine that prejudgment interest was substantive. Moreover, the United States Supreme Court has found other state laws that have no relationship to damages to be substantive in FELA cases. See, e.g., Dice v. Akron, Canton & Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S. 359, 363, 72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398 (1952) (concluding that the right to have a jury decide factual issues of fraud is \u201ctoo substantial a part of the rights accorded by [FELA] to permit it to be classified as a mere local rule of procedure\u2019 \u201d); Brown, 338 U.S. at 299, 70 S.Ct. 105 (<HOLDING>); White, 238 U.S. at 511-12, 35 S.Ct. 865 holding that state courts must apply the federal pleading standard in fela casesholding that in diversity cases federal courts are to apply state substantive law and federal procedural lawholding that litigants may enforce fela in state courts as a matter of right but also observing that state courts are free to apply their own modes of procedure to fela casesrecognizing that the federal pleading standard is a less stringent standard than the delaware pleading standardholding that federal courts must apply state substantive law in diversity cases & \n\nthe alternative method of demonstrating scienter\u2014 motive \u2014 has not been established. Plaintiffs contend that the Andersen defendants were motivated to participate in the fraud because of personal gain. However, they have alleged no gain other than the fact that the Andersen firm was compensated for its professional services. It would defy common sense to hold that the motive element of the Beck scienter analysis would be satisfied merely by alleging the receipt of normal compensation for professional services rendered, because to do so would effectively abolish the requirement, as against professional defendants in a securities fraud action, of pleading facts which support a strong inference of scienter. Cf. Wilson v. Saintine Exploration and Drilling Corp., 872 F.2d 1124 (2d Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, the Section 10(b) claim is holding that a professional owes no duty to third persons unless the professional had actual knowledge that those persons would rely on his rendering of professional servicesholding professional malpractice claim not contractualholding that ijnsurance policies are contracts and as such they are to be enforced according to their provisions and ijnsurance companies must be able to rely on their statements of coverage exclusions disclaimers definitions and other provisions in order to receive the benefit of their bargainholding that professional defendants who merely perform their usual professional functions and receive their normal compensation are not liable under the draconian provisions of section 122holding that 1 principal shareholder and chief executive officer of chapter 11 debtor in liquidation is not entitled to compensation beyond normal salary for performing duties required of the debtor 2 professional is a term which is not narrowly construed but applies to anyone the nature of whose services meet the criteria of a professional person 3 a professional license is not dispositive and 4 factors include form of compensation time of retention pre or postpetition and whether employment is full time or parttime & \n\nprotest jurisdiction into pre-procurement decisions. As plaintiffs characterize in responding to defendant\u2019s criticism of their failure to cite authority for their assertions of OCI violations: \u201c[o]f course there are no cases directly on point; there was no such jurisdiction in this Court or in any other forum prior to this case.\u201d (Pls.\u2019 Resp.\/Reply Def.\u2019s Mot.

Although the Fourth Circuit has not squarely addressed this issue, published authority from other circuits is divided on this question, but the better reasoned, ap posite decisions favor Lentz\u2019s \u201cauthorship\u201d argument over the government\u2019s \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d argument in the circumstances presented here. To be sure, several circuits have allowed the government to present evidence of a defendant\u2019s refusal to provide a handwriting exemplar as evidence of that defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt for the offense charged, as the government here requests. See, e.g., Askew, 584 F.2d at 963 (<HOLDING>). These decisions, however, are inapposite, as holding that while the government was required to prove that the defendants phone call crossed a state line the government did not need to prove that the defendant knew of the interstate nexusholding in a prosecution for the interstate transportation of forged securities that the government was permitted to prove and comment on a defendants refusal to produce exemplars as tending to prove his guilt of the offense chargedrecognizing the right of a defendant to comment upon the failure of the state to produce evidenceholding due process clause requires the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements included in the definition of the charged offense and new york law that requires the defendant in a second degree murder prosecution to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance in order to reduce the crime to manslaughter when no element of the charged offense is presumed does not violate the due process clauseholding that the government need not prove that interstate transport was foreseeable in order to obtain a conviction under 18 usc 2314 which prohibits the interstate transportation of stolen goods & \n\nre Roso), 76 F.3d 179, 181 (8th Cir.1996).

On this record, there was sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Jeanette was running a business that had the requisite nexus to interstate commerce. Although the speakeasy was not a licensed bar, it was selling alcohol and the people playing cards at the time of the robbery were its c (2d Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). There was also evidence here from which a holding that the single transaction rule protects a purchaser of stolen goods who by definition must know the goods to be stolen from being made party to the original theft via conspiracyholding that a buyer who purchases goods subject to an express warranty that the goods are free from all liens takes free of any unperfected security interestholding that a creditors pmsi in goods sold to debtors did not survive consolidation of the original installment contract with a later contract for the purchase of additional goodsholding that the hobbs act jurisdictional nexus was met by the robbery of a delicatessen that sold goods produced out of state without mentioning whether the goods were purchased from outofstate or instate suppliersholding that a statement of conditional sale of goods can be filed with the state auditor before the delivery of goods where statute says the statement must be filed within ten days of delivery of goods & \n\nBaty further stated that Booth\u2019s representation to Baty was the reason that a warranty and representation to that effect was expressly included in the sale agreements. Howard & Howard communicated its representations via telephone calls and emails. Although the two paragraphs cobble together a few details, they fail to give even one date on which an alleged misrepresentation occurred. That alone dooms ABI\u2019s ability to allege fraud with particularity. See Heinrich, 668 F.3d at 393 (finding that a plaintiff failed to allege fraud with sufficient particularity because she \u201cd[id] not include [in her affidavit] the date she received the allegedly fraudulent email from the defendants.\u201d); see also United States ex rel.

Walgreen Co., holding that the pleading standard set forth in twombly applies to all civil actionsholding that defendants failed to carry burden of proof to show that plaintiffs failed to mitigate damages when among other things they offered no evidence contradicting the plaintiffs evidenceholding that pleading was insufficient where the plaintiff failed to among other things set forth the dates of any fraudulent statementsholding that plaintiff had no jurisdiction in federal court because she failed to allege a state law claim but declining to discuss pleading requirement to set forth charge of discriminationholding that defendant did not breach oral agreement because among other things the plaintiff had not established that the term in question was part of the oral contract & \n\na \"jurisdictional element which would ensure, through case-hy-case inquiry,\u201d that the defendant's particular offense \"affects interstate commerce.\u201d Lopez, 514 U.S. at 561, 115 S.Ct. at 1631; see also United States v. Olin Corp., 107 F.3d 1506, 1509 (11th Cir.1997). The conclusion that Lopez does not require an individualized finding of \"substantial effect\" to sustain a conviction under \u00a7 844(i)\u2019s second prong is consistent with the holdings of several other circuits. See, e.g., United States v. Tocco, 135 F.3d 116, 123-24 (2d Cir.)

As an appellate court, we cannot adequately evaluate, in the first instance, Coleman\u2019s factual allegations against his trial and state habeas lawyers. Therefore, the judgment dismissing the petition is REVERSED, and the matter is REMANDED. The distinct court should determine whether Coleman has satisfied the remaining two requirements to show cause for procedural default under Martinez and Trevino and should conduct proceedings as needed. We express no view on what decisions the court should make on remand. 1 . State v. Ratcliff, 416 So.2d 528, 530 (La. 1982) (<HOLDING>); State v.

Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.7(d). While the Court of Criminal Appeals refers to all three of these rules in its peitinent order, we focus our analysis on Rule 32.6(b), as Frazier\u2019s failure to provide \"full disclosure of the factual basis\u201d of the relevant claim was the sine qua non of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s dismissal. 7 . It is uncontroversial that \"[i]f the petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies that are no longer available, that failure is a procedural default which will bar federal habeas relief, unless either the cause and prejudice or the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is established.\u201d Smith v. Jones, 256 F.3d 1135, 1138 (11th Cir.2001); see also Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep't of Corr., 568 F.3d 894, 908 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Because we find no procedural default, we holding that a petitioner may overcome a procedural default by demonstrating either 1 an adequate cause for and actual prejudice arising from the default or 2 that a miscarriage of justice caused by a substantial denial of constitutional rights will occur if the petitioners federal claims are not considered quoting lynd v terry 470 f3d 1308 131314 11th cir2006holding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that trial court must make entry of default prior to entry of default judgment and court may not make entry of default when there is no default in law or in factholding that a federal court may excuse a state habeas petitioners procedural default if the petitioner can show cause for the failure to raise the claim and prejudice resulting from such failureholding that the novelty of a petitioners claim can constitute cause for a procedural default & \n\nrestitution was set, the court was required to evaluate an inmate\u2019s individual ability to pay. See State v. Haines, 360 N.W.2d 791 (Iowa 1985) (noting that it is the \u201creasonable ability to pay\u201d standard which allows \u00a7 910.2 to pass constitutional muster). In addition, the plan of restitution and plan of payment were both subject to modification by the court. See Iowa Code \u00a7 910.7. Once this initial deprivation occurred, the inmates\u2019 interest in their money was diminished, much like the limitations on the freedom to spend money suffered by any person who incurs a debt. When the Department took the next step of designating specific procedures for the repayment of an inmate\u2019s restitution, the procedural requirements diminished. See, e.g., Scott v. Angelone, 771 F.Supp. 1064 (D.Nev.1991) (<HOLDING>).

See also Shen v. Japan Airlines, 918 F.Supp. 686, 692 (S.D.N.Y.1994). The Seventh Circuit similarly required strict compliance under section 1608(a) in Alberti v. Empresa Nicaraguense De La Carne, 705 F.2d 250, 253 (7th Cir.1983). In that case, noting that section 1608(a) \u201cdelineates the \u2018exclusive procedures\u2019 for effecting service of process upon a foreign state,\u201d the court refused to excuse the plaintiffs service on the Nicaraguan Ambassador in lieu of the head of the foreign affairs ministry. See also Magnus Elec., Inc., v. Royal Bank of Canada, 620 F.Supp. 387, 389 (N.D.Ill.1985), aff'd in part, rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 830 F.2d 1396 (7th Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>).

In Chatman-Bey v. Thornburgh, 864 F.2d 804, 808-10 (D.C.Cir.1988) (en banc), this court had held that a federal prisoner seeking to challenge his parole eligibility date was required to proceed in habeas, even though success upon his claims would not necessarily result in his earlier release. Later, however, in Anyanwutaku v. Moore, 151 F.3d 1053, 1055-57 (D.C.Cir. 1998), we permitted a District of Columbia prisoner to challenge his parole eligibility date in a suit for damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. In the latter case, we relied primarily upon two Supreme Court cases, Edwards v. Balisok, 520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997) (<HOLDING>), and Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. holding that the district court mischaracterized a state prisoners 1983 claim as a petition for writ of habeas corpus because the prisoner did not attack his conviction challenge the fact or length of his confinement or seek immediate release from prisonholding that that if the success of a 1983 damages claim brought by a prisoner would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence the prisoner may only bring the claim where the conviction or sentence has been invalidatedholding that to recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a 42 usc 1983 plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal or called into question by federal courts issuance of writ of habeas corpus footnote omittedholding that a state prisoner must bring his claim in habeas only if by prevailing he would necessarily prove the unlawfulness of his conviction or confinementholding that in order to recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction or imprisonment or for other harm caused by actions whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or sentence invalid a plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal expunged by executive order declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination or called into question by a federal courts issuance of a writ of habeas corpus & \n\nIn addition, to the extent Olmstead has argued that the court abused its discretion in denying his Rule 60(b) motion because he was proceeding without counsel, a defendant\u2019s pro se status in civil litigation generally will not excuse mistakes he makes regarding procedural mies. See McNeil v. United States, 508 U.S. 106, 113, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1984, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993) (explaining that the Court \u201cnever [had] suggested that procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation should be interpreted so as to excuse mistakes by those who proceed without counsel,\u201d because \u201cexperience teaches that strict adherence to the procedural requirements specified by the legislature is the best guarantee of evenhanded administration of the law\u201d); see also Wayne v. Jarvis, 197 F.3d 1098, 1104 (11th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, relief cannot be granted under Rule holding that a pro se litigants failure to comply with the filing deadlines for a notice of appeal set out in federal rule of bankruptcy procedure 8002 meant that the district court lacked jurisdiction over the litigants appealholding that although pro se litigants are entitled to liberal construction of their pleadings pro se litigants must follow procedural rulesrecognizing that although pro se litigants are not entitled to greater rights than represented litigants due process principles permit the imposition of a procedural bar only after consideration of the pro se litigants reasonable expectations about what had occurredholding that rule 56f applies to pro se litigantsholding that liberal construction of the pleading requirements for pro se litigants does not equate with liberal deadlines & \n\nWL 3487723, at *4-*6 (W.D.Tex. Nov. 3, 2005) (rejecting policy argument). For example, Albany Insurance Co. v. Bengal Marine, Inc. involved a policy requiring the insured to pay a certain deductible before the insurer became liable; the Fifth Circuit, applying Louisiana law, held that, in light of Louisiana\u2019s direct action statute, the insurer was liable for claims above the deductible up to the policy limit when the insured could not pay the deductible due to insolvency. 857 F.2d 250, 255-56 (5th Cir.1988). Other courts have reached a similar result by holding that enforcing retained limit or deductible provisions in this situation would defeat state bankruptcy provision laws. See, e.g., Home Ins. Co. of Ill. v. Hooper, 294 Ill. App.3d 626, 229 Ill.Dec. 129, 691 N.E.2d 65, 70 (1998) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 178 Ill.2d 576, 232 Ill.Dec. holding that illinois public policy did not require the application of illinois law to an illinois accident involving only indiana residents insured in indianaholding that defendants testimony that he did not see a provision in the agreement because the plaintiffcounterparty failed to direct him to the provision was insufficient as a matter of law to establish fraud and defendant was therefore bound to the terms of the provisionholding that an insurers reliance on a retained limit provision referred to as a selfinsured retention limit to avoid payment when the insured became insolvent was directly contrary to the public policy as declared by the legislative enactment of illinois bankruptcy provision lawholding contribution claim against attorney not contrary to illinois public policyholding that an arbitration award involving the appellants challenge to the failure of the insurance company to ensure that he had read and understood a signed waiver and to attach the waiver to the insurance policy as contrary to public policy is not reviewable by the courts because there is no challenge to a provision or term of the policy the appellant never claimed that the waiver or policy language itself was contrary to the public policy of this commonwealth & \n\n93 S.Ct. 2523, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973). In all \u201cspecial needs\u201d cases, the nature of the need addressed makes particularized suspicion impossible or otherwise renders the warrant requirement impractical. For example, in Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 876, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987), the Court noted that requiring a warrant before a search of a probationer\u2019s home would \u201cinterfere to an appreciable degree with the probation system,\u201d and would \u201creduce the deterrent effect that the possibility of expeditious searches would otherwise create.\u201d Similarly, the Burger Court noted that \u201csurprise is crucial if the regulatory scheme aimed at remedying this major social problem is to function at all.\u201d 482 U.S. at 710, 107 S.Ct. 2636; see also Skinner, 489 U.S. at 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402 (<HOLDING>). If a special need renders the warrant recognizing the existence of the special relationshipholding that the need for flexibility within the probation system and the special relationship existing between a probationer and his probation officer justified departing from the usual warrant requirementholding that imposing the traditional warrant and probablecause requirements would unduly interfere with the effective administration of the illinois probation system because the process of obtaining a warrant would delay the officers ability to respond to evidence of misconduct by the probationer and would facilitate the probationers evasion of probation conditions through concealment of misconductrecognizing the searchincidenttoarrest exception to the warrant requirementrecognizing that the special need articulated must make the warrant and probablecause requirement impracticable before waiving those requirements & \n\n(\u201cThe mere assertion by the petitioner that there was insufficient evidence, without more, cannot support a finding of deprivation of due process.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 5 . In the complaint, in addition to the specific allegation against defendant Knight, Grinter alleges \"defendants\u201d violated his \"equal rights\u201d in violation of \u00a7 1981. \"This court has adopted the requirement that a plaintiff allege with particularity all material facts to be relied upon when asserting that a governmental official has violated a constitutional right.\u201d Terrance v. Northville Reg'l Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d 834, 842 (6th Cir.2002). Such \"conclusoiy, unsupported statements\u201d are \"insufficient to state a claim.\u201d Dellis v. Corr.

Johnson, 407 F.3d 801, 807 holding that the prisoner must exhaust his administrative remedies as to each defendant later suedholding that a plaintiff need not exhaust his administrative remedies to bring a retaliation claimholding that a prisoner exhausted his administrative remedies even though his grievance was untimelyholding that an alien must exhaust administrative remedies before seeking habeas relief from detentionholding that a prisoner failed to exhaust his administrative remedies when he did not utilize grievance procedures that permitted waiver of the time limit for good cause & \n\ndue process claim was proper because it was subsumed by his Fourth Amendment claim. See Armendariz v. Penman, 75 F.3d 1311, 1320 (9th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Summary judgment was proper on McKinney\u2019s First Amendment claim because McKinney failed to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the officers acted with intent to deny McKinney his first amendment rights. Cf. Sloman v. Tadlock, 21 F.3d 1462, 1469 (9th Cir.1994). Summary judgment on McKinney\u2019s claim alleging the seized property was never returned to him was proper because McKinney admitted at deposition that he did not follow California state law procedures for recovering property pursuant to Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 1536. See City of West Covina v. Perkins, 525 U.S. 234, 241, 119 S.Ct. 678, 142 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (<HOLDING>).

The confusion that can arise from loose talk of \u201cseverance\u201d where in fact only a separation of claims has occurred, together with the impact the distinction can have on appellate jurisdiction, occasionally has provoked judicial frustration. See Spencer, White & Prentis, Inc. v. Pfizer, 498 F.2d 358, 359 (2 d Cir.1974) (speaking of the \u201ctangle of Rules 21, 42(b) [and] 54(b)\u201d). In the context of removal to federal court in diversity jurisdiction, the mere fact that an order of a state court purports to have \u201csevered\u201d claims generally is insufficient to make a case removable. See Nolan v. Boeing Co., 919 F.2d 1058, 1067 (5th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>); Phillips v. Unijax, Inc., 625 F.2d 54, 56 holding that diversitydefeating parties were not severed from a case so as to permit removal to federal court where article 1038 of the louisiana code of civil procedure pursuant to which the severance was made authorizes separate trials rather than a true severanceholding the lumpsum payment of a severance benefit to be evidence of lack of an administrative schemeholding that a plan providing severance pay for reduction in work force simply did not contemplate the effect of a sale of a business on the availability of severance payholding that severance pay policy was part of employment contractholding that death qualification of jury is not of itself grounds for severance of a noncapital defendant & \n\nfavor because the issue was never raised by either party. Pursuant to La.

Thus, the responses to the questionnaires must themselves fall within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rale. Cf. In re G.Y., 962 P.2d 78, 85 (Utah Ct. App. 1998) (<HOLDING>).

Bank of America contends that with respect to the \"unusual circumstances\u201d exception, the debtors were required to demonstrate \"unusual circumstances\u201d as well as satisfy the standard for issuance of a preliminary injunction. The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the exception in a way that supports Bank of America's position. See Solidus Networks, Inc. v. Excel Innovations, Inc. (In re Excel Innovations), 502 F.3d 1086, 1096 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding that the unusual circumstances exception was not a separate basis for staying nondebtor litigation from the traditional preliminary injunction standardholding that the standard for permanent injunction is the same as that for preliminary injunction with the one exception being that the plaintiff must show actual success on the merits rather than likelihood of successholding that when the district court applies the wrong preliminary injunction standard this court may review the record to determine whether the injunction is justifiedholding that court can consider inadmissible evidence in the context of a motion for preliminary injunctionholding that plaintiffs were not entitled to a preliminary injunction & \n\nprivilege to avoid liability here. See Petta, 44 S.W.3d at 579-80; see also Salda\u00f1a, 2001 WL 85862, at *1. S. Were the Requirements of \u00a7 9.51(a) Satisfied? Given that the Government can invoke the \u00a7 9.51(a) privilege, we must then ask whether the agents\u2019 conduct conformed to the requirements of \u00a7 9.51(a). The district court\u2019s findings, which are not clearly erroneous, indicate that the agents were (1) \u201cpeace officers\u201d who (2) identified themselves as officers when they entered the Salon, (3) reasonably believed the arrest of Villafi'anca was lawful based on his resistance, (4) made clear their purpose to arrest Villafranca, and (5) used force reasonably believed to be immediately necessary to make the arrest. See also Fraire v. City of Arlington, 957 F.2d 1268, 1276-77 (5th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>); Hinojosa, 834 F.2d at 1231 (concluding that a holding that inquiry as to whether officers are entitled to qualified immunity for use of excessive force is distinct from inquiry on the merits of the excessive force claimholding that deputies use of a police dog is subject to excessive force analysisholding that ordering police officers to use excessive force in bringing a lawyer into court was a judicial actholding that the right to be free from the use of excessive force has been well established since 1976holding that a police officer was not liable for use of excessive force since 951 requirements were satisfied & \n\nimmediate appeals of interlocutory orders if a statute explicitly provides such jurisdiction. See Tex. A & M Univ. Sys. v. Koseoglu, 233 S.W.3d 835, 840 (Tex.2007). We strictly construe a statute authorizing an interlocutory appeal because it is an exception to the general rule that only final judgments are appealable. Id. at 841. To appeal pursuant to section 51.014(a)(5), the appellant must be \u201can individual who is an officer or employee of the state or a political subdivision of the state.\u201d See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 51.014(a)(5). Rogers does not argue that he is a state employee or that he otherwise contracted with a governmental entity to perform governmental duties. See id.; see also Knowles v. City of Granbury, 953 S.W.2d 19, 24 (Tex.App.-Fort Worth 1997, pet. denied) (<HOLDING>). We therefore limit our inquiry to whether holding that private party can assert official immunity if it contracted with a public official to perform governmental dutiesholding that where a public official takes discretionary action that the official knows will directly benefit a financial interest that the official has concealed in violation of a state criminal law that official has deprived the public of his honest services under 1346holding that if official has violated clearly established law he is entitled to qualified immunity only if reasonable official could have believed conduct was lawfulholding police officer is a public officialholding that a state official can be held individually hable under 1983 for acts taken within the scope of his or her official duties & \n\n672 (10th Cir. 1999). If it were otherwise, a party could just attach all of his evidence to a motion for dismissal and thereby vitiate the critical distinction between dismissal proceedings, which are supposed to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint, and summary judgment proceedings, which properly encompass opposing evidence. As for substance, defendant\u2019s affidavit, indicating that the treatment recommended in 2007 was no longer appropriate in October 2008, does not demonstrate a difference of opinion as to the initial recommendation. And, of course, as Mr. Arocho has consistently claimed, the failure to treat his disease for such an interval itself may give rise to cognizable harm. See generally Erickson v.

While the Court must weigh all the aforementioned factors, Sofamor Danek Group, Inc. v. DePuy-Motech, Inc., 74 F.3d 1216, 1219 (Fed.Cir.1996), the first two factors in this inquiry (i.e., the likelihood of success and irreparable harm factors) are \u201c[cjentral to the movant\u2019s burden,\u201d and the Court \u201cmay decline to issue a preliminary injunction if the movant does not prove either of these factors.\u201d Jeneric\/Pentron, Inc. v.

While defendant objects to this, he offers no statutory or legal analysis to support the contention that his claimed double enhancement is inappropriate. The critical point from Bewersdorf is that the OUIL provisions increased the punishment for each repeated offense, just as the SORA provisions do in the present case. In fact, defendant concedes that there is no error in enhancing a SORA-2 sentence under the habitual-offender provisions as long as the habitual-offender enhancement is based on a felony other than a SORA violation. Thus, to this extent, defendant agrees with our conclusion that MCL 28.729(1) sets forth separate, elevated offenses. 51 E.g., People v Eilola, 179 Mich App 315, 325; 445 NW2d 490 (1989) (<HOLDING>); People v Brown, 186 Mich App 350, 357; 463 holding that the habitualoffender provisions could be used to enhance a sentence for a conviction that constituted firstdegree retail fraud because of a prior conviction mcl 750356c2 as added by 1988 pa 20holding an uncounseled misdemeanor conviction is valid because no prison term was imposed and the conviction may be used to enhance a sentence for a subsequent offenseholding that a juvenile adjudication may be used as a prior conviction for apprendi purposesholding the death sentence proportional for the firstdegree murder conviction where the aggravators included prior violent felony conviction and hacholding that any fact other than a prior conviction may not be used to enhance a defendants sentence beyond the statutory maximum unless it is submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt & \n\nor coercion, or to retaliate against government conduct,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332b(g)(5)(A).

A hypothetical illustrates the efficacy of a unitary standard of review. If a district court were to depart upward based upon physical injury pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.2, p.s., we might conclude that it had abused its discretion if the underlying offense were obstruction of justice, because the guideline applicable to that offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.2(b)(1), provides for an eight-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the offense involved caus[es] ... physical injury to a person.\u201d Our review in such a situation would amount to a de novo review of the applicable guideline to determine whether, as a matter of law, it takes physical injury into account.

If the State fails to establish willfulness, then Richardson should be sentenced in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement previously accepted by the trial court. See Lowery v.

This conduct is the functional equivalent of the obstruction or impairment contemplated in Sakansky and Bean. The trial court also found that the deviation proposed by the plaintiff would not unduly burden the defendant. We uphold such findings if they are supported by the evidence and are not erroneous as a matter of law. See Batakis v. Town of Belmont, 135 N.H. 595, 597, 607 A.2d 956, 957 (1992). The record supports the trial court\u2019s findings. Under these circumstances, the owner of the dominant estate may deviate from the deeded easement to the extent reasonably necessary to secure an egress to the highway. Cf. Haley v. Colcord, 59 N.H. 7, 9 (1879) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling holding that an easement is not a separate estate when dominant and servient tracts are under the same ownershipholding that the owner of the dominant tenement may extinguish an easement appurtenant by specifically excluding it from a conveyance of the dominant estateholding that the burden on the servient estate cannot be increased without the consent of the owners of the servient estate and that the owner of the dominant estate to which the appurtenant easement is attached has no power to convey or expand use of that easement in connection with a tract of land owned by anotherrecognizing that the dominant easement owner not the servient estate owner bears responsibility for maintaining an easementholding that dominant tenant may deviate from path of prescriptive easement to extent reasonably necessary to pass around obstruction created by servient tenant & \n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel); Boag v.

However, the record overwhelmingly supports a finding that Valdez was a leader and\/or organizer of the conspiracy, thereby qualifying him for an enhancement under \u00a7 3B1.1. And according to the testimony of a co-conspirator, Valdez possessed a firearm during the commission of the conspiracy and it was not \u201cclearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3; see also United States v.

The statute places the affirmative burden on the State to allege the prior offense upon which it relies for the imposition of the mandatory sentence. The State does not meet that burden by the penalty format it uses here. [\u00b6 13] In State v.

The analysis in the Federal decisions appears holding that due process rights were not violated when alien claimed a lack of actual notice but his attorney received noticeholding there was no evidence a reasonably prudent employee in similar circumstances would have believed facts reported by plaintiff were a violation of lawholding that due process does not require defendant to receive verbal notice of standard probation conditions because all persons have constructive notice of states criminal statutesholding probationer who did not receive notice of specific offenses she was believed to have committed but had notice of probation terms states attorney believed were violated and of the facts constituting violation was not harmedholding that notice to the attorney of record constitutes notice to the petitioner & \n\nan ordinary household item is not only present in virtually every American household\u2014it was also readily available within the Home Depot outlet where the device was installed.

The language in Posnjak on which.Sheehan relies makes sense when read to require that a \u201ccombination of parts\u201d cannot be considered a destructive device based on the hypothetical possibility that the parts could be \u201creadily\u201d made into a bomb only if the defendant could obtain some crucial component that he did not possess and could not acquire without. a \u201cshopping trip.\u201d See, e.g., United States v. Malone, 546 F.2d 1182, 1184 (5th Cir. 1977) (<HOLDING>). Posn-jak cannot sensibly be read to require holding that the defendant could not be convicted for possessing a combination of parts that could be readily assembled into a bomb where the defendant did not possess any explosive material a key element required for the creation of a bombholding the district court did not clearly err in applying the enhancement where guns were found on the same premises from which the defendant trafficked drugs and were readily accessible to the defendantholding that jurys verdict for the defendant in a breach of contract action did not establish the absence of breach because the jury was instructed that it could find for the defendant if it concluded that the defendant had not breached the contract or if the defendant proved an affirmative defenseholding that a reasonable jury could find the device to be readily convertible into an explosive bomb where wires could be quickly stripped and recrimped to a pager that was part of the detonating mechanismholding that evidence of a defendants prior criminal convictions could be introduced for the purpose of sentence enhancement if the jury was instructed that the evidence could not be used for the purposes of determining guilt & \n\nDistrict Court Approval). No mention is made of conditional discharge or deferred sentencing in these forms, and no form indicates the possibility of being found not guilty or of having the charges dismissed for any one of the myriad other reasons that can result in dismissal. {12} Nonetheless, because of the ubiquitousness of the language that a defendant must be informed of the permissible range of sentences, see Boykin v. Ala., 395 U.S. 238, 245 n. 1, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), Petitioner claims that his plea was involuntary because the officer did not advise him that he could appear in court and request a deferral of the prosecution or a deferred sentence.

Smith, 615 F.2d 964, 17 V.I. 623 (3d Cir. 1980): If a defendant\u2019s right to due process can be violated by strict rules of evidence that prevent a defendant from presenting clearly exculpatory evidence to the jury, can that same right also be violated by the failure to affirmatively grant immunity to an available defense witness who will not testify under grounds of self-incrimination when the witness is likely to offer clearly exculpatory testimony? Smith said \u201cyes,\u201d observing that the latter violation is \u201cnot different in substance than the violation found in Chambers.\u201d Id. at 970. Indeed, cases like Chambers; Gideon v.

Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he denied defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance so that he might have time to obtain a valid license. The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred when he denied his pretrial motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. He says that the trial justice denied the motion based \u201con an opinion not fact.\u201d Kowal has offered only a vague religiously oriented argument about why the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction over him. He has directed us to no legal authority that supports his position.

Accordingly, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment and RENDER judgment for Atlanta Speciality. REVERSED AND RENDERED. 1 . The Mississippi Supreme Court has found various provisions of uninsured motorist policies ambiguous. See Government Employees Ins. Co. v. Brown, 446 So.2d 1002, 1006 (Miss.1984) (limitation of liability clause); Pearthree v. Hartford Accident & Indem. Co., 373 So.2d 267, 270-71 (Miss.1979) (same); Hartford Accident & Indem. Co. v.

There is no dispute in this case that the holding that limitation of liability clause was unambiguousholding that an identical or nearly identical limitation of liability clause was valid and enforceable under georgia lawholding that the interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of lawholding that if easement language is clear and unambiguous and does not limit its duration then the court cannot impose such a limitationholding that duration of limitation is a factor in determining whether limitation is significant & \n\n311 (7th Cir.1992); Patterson v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 11 F.3d 948, 950 (9th Cir.1993). Construing the ambiguity against the drafter under the applicable state law doctrine of contra proferentem, these circuits have held that the limitation does not include organically based illnesses. Phillips, 978 F.2d at 311; Patterson, 11 F.3d at 950. This court has held that \u201c[a]n insurance contract is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations that can fairly be made. When one of these interpretations results in coverage and another results in exclusion, ambiguity exists in the insurance policy.\u201d Dahl-Eimers v. Mut. of Omaha Life Ins. Co., 986 F.2d 1379, 1381 (11th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). The district court reasoned th 8 F.2d 302, 304, 310-11 (7th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>), with Brewer v. Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins.

Nov. 3, 2005) (rejecting policy argument). For example, Albany Insurance Co. v. Bengal Marine, Inc. involved a policy requiring the insured to pay a certain deductible before the insurer became liable; the Fifth Circuit, applying Louisiana law, held that, in light of Louisiana\u2019s direct action statute, the insurer was liable for claims above the deductible up to the policy limit when the insured could not pay the deductible due to insolvency. 857 F.2d 250, 255-56 (5th Cir.1988). Other courts have reached a similar result by holding that enforcing retained limit or deductible provisions in this situation would defeat state bankruptcy provision laws. See, e.g., Home Ins. Co. of Ill. v. Hooper, 294 Ill. App.3d 626, 229 Ill.Dec. 129, 691 N.E.2d 65, 70 (1998) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 178 Ill.2d 576, 232 Ill.Dec. holding that illinois public policy did not require the application of illinois law to an illinois accident involving only indiana residents insured in indianaholding that defendants testimony that he did not see a provision in the agreement because the plaintiffcounterparty failed to direct him to the provision was insufficient as a matter of law to establish fraud and defendant was therefore bound to the terms of the provisionholding that an insurers reliance on a retained limit provision referred to as a selfinsured retention limit to avoid payment when the insured became insolvent was directly contrary to the public policy as declared by the legislative enactment of illinois bankruptcy provision lawholding contribution claim against attorney not contrary to illinois public policyholding that an arbitration award involving the appellants challenge to the failure of the insurance company to ensure that he had read and understood a signed waiver and to attach the waiver to the insurance policy as contrary to public policy is not reviewable by the courts because there is no challenge to a provision or term of the policy the appellant never claimed that the waiver or policy language itself was contrary to the public policy of this commonwealth & \n\nsubject to the exclusions in the policy\u201d). Accordingly, an additional insured not only reaps the benefits of the insured\u2019s policy, but it also bears the burden of the exclusions. It is further our view that, if the insurer intended to exclude indemnification agreements within insured contracts from the substantial restriction on coverage that the On-Premises Endorsement constitutes, the policy would have expressly so stated. See Maroney v. New York Central Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 5 N.Y.3d 467, 805 N.Y.S.2d 533, 839 N.E.2d 886, 889 (2005) (stating that \u201c[i]f the insurer intended to limit [an] exclusion * * * it could have done so explicitly, as it does in the very same policy\u2019s * * * provisions\u201d); see also Chimbay v. AvalonBay Communities, Inc., 742 F.Supp.2d 265, 283 (E.D.N.Y.2008) (<HOLDING>). The policy at issue in the instant case does holding a personal profit exclusion applicable to an insured corporation where the purpose of the exclusion was to exclude coverage when the insured received profits to which the insured was not legally entitledholding that if an insurer intended to exclude insured contracts from the provision denying coverage for injuries to employees it could have expressly stated as suchholding that if an insurer denies coverage based on an assertion that the underlying claim is excluded from coverage there is a presumption that the insurer did not suffer prejudice because prompt notice would have merely resulted in an earlier denial of coverageholding that insured cannot demand reimbursement for defense insurer had no opportunity to control if insured does not promptly notify insurer of facts triggering coveragerecognizing that a conflict of interest may provide the source of prejudice upon which an insured may rely to estop an insurer from denying coverage & \n\nof 1988 Act No. 305, \u00a7 1. The 1988 version provided an exemption for \u201ccash surrender value of life insurance in the aggregate amount of not more than fifty thousand dollars.\u201d In 1993, the General Assembly enacted the current version of S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 38-63-40 as part of 1992 Act No. 89, \u00a7 1, which removed the fifty thousand dollar limitation on the cash surrender value exemption and added several key provisions to the statute. Specifically, the General Assembly provided that proceeds and cash surrender values were protected \u201cwhether or not the right to change the beneficiary is reserved\u201d and \u201cwhether or not the policy is payable to the insured if the beneficiary dies first\u201d and added an exception in cases where \u201cthe insured has filed a petition in bankruptcy within two years of 002) (<HOLDING>); In re Henderson, 167 B.R. 67, 73 holding that the debtorinsured was entitled to exempt the cash surrender value of her life insurance policy naming her dependent son as a beneficiary under illinois statute providing exemption for all proceeds payable because of the death of the insured and the aggregate cash value of any or all life insurance policies payable to a wife or husband of the insured or to a child parent or other person dependent upon the insuredholding as unambiguous under iowa law the insurance policys exclusion of coverage to any obligation of the insured to indemnify another because of damages arising out of a bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insuredholding that a debtor in bankruptcy may claim as exempt the cash surrender value of a life insurance policy insuring the life of the debtor that is payable to a beneficiary other than the debtor under dccode ann 314716a2001 despite the absence of the term cash surrender from the statuteholding that the tennessee statute providing an exemption for a life insurance policy made for the benefit of the insureds spouse andor children or dependent relatives allows for the exemption of the cash surrender values of such policiesholding that where the debtor is the owner of a policy insuring his own life and listing his wife as the beneficiary upon his death the proceeds of the policy including the cash value thereof are exempt from the claims of the insureds creditors & \n\nUnited States\u201d of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.1 l(2)(a), as the exception to the more general scope of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(1), which reads: \u201cof a court of record in this state.\u201d Additionally, Kiesel applied (and the Balfour court relied on) the principle of statutory interpretation; which dictates that the latter portions of a statute, if in conflict with earlier portions, shall control. In interpreting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11, the Kiesel (state) and Balfour (federal) courts found that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(2)(a) controls post-judgment collection proceedings. It is important to note, however, that the holding in Balfour was expressly limited to the facts of that case, which involved a \u201cpost-judgment discovery request,\u201d six years after the initial default judgment was entered. See Balfour, 170 F.3d at 1051 (<HOLDING>). A few years later, in 2001, the Fourth holding that section 1001 controls over the limitations provision of the wrongful death statuteholding that when a statute and a guideline conflict the statute controlsholding that one year limitations period in insurance policy was reasonable and therefore enforceable to shorten the fifteen year statute of limitations for breach of contractholding that under such unique circumstances the five 5 year statute of limitations controlsrecognizing that a specific statute controls over a general one & \n\nare not applied strictly. Flexible applications of procedural statutes of limitations may be based on equitable principles, such as the discovery rule, e.g., Lopez v. Swyer, 62 N.J. 267, 300 A.2d 563 (1973), or estoppel, e.g., O\u2019Keeffe v. Snyder, 83 N.J. 478, 416 A.2d 862 (1980).\u201d In short, under varying circumstances we have recognized that tolling of the statute of limitations is the fair and responsible result, because the \u201c[ujnswerving \u2018mechanistic\u2019 application of statutes of limitations would at times inflict obvious and unnecessary harm upon individual plaintiffs without advancing [the] legislative purposes.\u201d Galligan v. Westfield Ctr. Serv., Inc., 82 N.J. 188, 192, 412 A.2d 122, 124 (1980). See also Peloso v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 56 N.J. 514, 521, 267 A.2d 498, 501 (1970) (<HOLDING>). III.

Subsection (d) preserved Rothmeier\u2019s opportunity to file his dismissed whistleblower claim in state court because the tolling provision was triggered when he \u201casserted\u201d the claim in federal court pursuant to subsection (a). See id. The federal court need not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claim for the statute of limitations to be tolled under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(d). See Obendorfer v. Gitano Group, Inc., 838 F.Supp. 950, 957 & n. 3 (D.N.J.1993); Winn v. North Am.

As a threshold matter, IAI and IAICMC owed holding that an insurer owes no duty of good faith to thirdparty claimants under the insurance code without reaching the question of a possible commonlaw dutyholding that a partner owes a duty to all other partners to exercise the utmost good faith fairness and loyaltyholding that the relationship of partners is of a fiduciary character and imposes upon them the obligation to exercise good faith and integrity in their dealingsholding that an insurer has a duty to act with the utmost good faith towards its insuredrecognizing that an attorney has a duty of loyalty to his client & \n\n(\u201cNew Jersey courts have applied the Cooper prejudice rule in various other contexts,\u201d including in cases \u201cinvolving both excess insurance and reinsurance despite the fact that reinsurance agreements are not contracts of adhesion.\u201d). The Cooper decision rejected prior case law that did not require that an insurer show appreciable prejudice when an insured breached a condition precedent to insurance coverage: Cf. Whittle v. Associated Indem. Corp., 130 N.J.L. 576, 33 A.2d 866, 868 (N.J.Err. & App.1943) (finding the insurance policy notice and cooperation provisions to be conditions precedent to coverage, and that the insured breach of those provisions permitted the insurer to disclaim coverage); Ebert v. Balter, 74 N.J.Super. 466, 181 A.2d 532, 535 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1962) (<HOLDING>). State National argues that the County\u2019s holding that an insurer can deny benefits based on late notice by the insured only when the insurer is prejudiced by the delayholding that the insureds liability has been established by the settlement and the insurer may not later relitigate the issueholding that a condition subsequent presupposes an existing obligation that is to be defeated or forfeited if the condition is not fulfilledholding that an insureds compliance with a condition precedent is not tested by the presence or absence of prejudice to the insurer but only by whether the condition has been fulfilled by the insured under all the circumstancesholding that right to payment does not accrue until condition precedent has been fulfilled & \n\nU.S. 490, 498, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Thus, in the absence of an injury and with no \u201creal and substantial\u201d dispute, the court properly declined to entertain Count I upon removal. In its Dismissal Opinion, the district court compared this proceeding to the situation in Bowen v. First Family Financial Services, Inc., 233 F.3d 1331 (11th Cir.2000). In Bowen, the class action plaintiffs lacked standing to question whether arbitration agreements are generally unenforceable under the Truth-in-Lending Act. The Eleventh Circuit so ruled because \u201cthere [was] no allegation that First Family has invoked, or threatened to invoke, the arbitration agreement to compel the plaintiffs to submit any claim to arbitration.\u201d Id. at 1339. This action is similar to Bo 02, 704 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (<HOLDING>). Notably, some courts have premised such holding that a dispute arising out of an insurance policy was not covered by the arbitration provision in the parties separate premium payment agreement because if the party had intended to subject this dispute to the arbitration provision it could easily clearly and unequivocally have done so either by including an arbitration provision in the insurance policy itself or by adding to the above arbitration provisionrecognizing as nonjusticiable challenge to arbitration provision absent sufficient indications that it would be invokedholding that an arbitration provision that waived class actions and thus required the consumer to pay a 125 fee to vindicate a 150 claim was substantively unconscionable but also holding that the waiver provision was severable from the remainder of the arbitration provision which would be enforcedholding that the trial court not the arbitrator must decide a challenge to an arbitration provision based on public policyholding that 4 does not empower court to rewrite venue provisions of arbitration clause or to order arbitration within district absent contractual provision so indicating & \n\nsentence. Specifically, Olmos-Esparza argues that the government\u2019s use of a certificate of nonexistence of record (\u201cCNR\u201d) and a warrant of deportation as evidence violated his Confrontation Clause rights under Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). The introduction of a CNR to prove that a defendant did not seek admission from the Attorney General to re-enter the United States does not constitute testimonial hearsay evidence prohibited by Crawford. Rather, it is properly admitted as a nontestimonial public record. United States v. Cervantes-Flores, 421 F.3d 825, \u2014, \u2014 (9th Cir.2005). Similarly, introduction of a warrant of deportation does not violate the Confrontation Clause. United States v. Bahena-Cardenas, 411 F.3d 1067, 1075 (9th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Thus, the district court did not err in holding that letters addressing dispute that was subject of litigation and that were written in anticipation of litigation did not fall under business record exception under rule 8036 of the federal rules of evidence and noting that it is wellestablished that one who prepares a document in anticipation of litigation is not acting in the regular course of businessholding that it is notholding that not all of claims file was prepared in anticipation of litigation and noting that the majority of cases that have dealt with the issue of whether investigative materials prepared by insurance claims adjusters is workproduct prepared in anticipation of litigation have held that since insurance companies have a routine duty to investigate accidents such materials are not prepared in anticipation of litigationholding that driving record is nontestimonial as it is not accusatory and does not describe specific criminal wrongdoing of the defendant it contains no expression of opinion or conclusion requiring the exercise of discretion and it merely represents the objective result of a public records searchholding a warrant of deportation nontestimonial because it was not made in anticipation of litigation and because it is simply a routine objective cataloging of an unambiguous factual matter & \n\nAct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 et seq. in interpreting ERISA's saving clause.

Southern Ry, 74 S.C. 27, 54 S.E. 211 (1906) (finding substantial compliance with provisions relating to service of notice upon the magistrate). Substantial compliance has also been applied in the insurance context. Home v. Gulf Life Ins. Co., 277 S.C. 336, 287 S.E.2d 144 (1982) (<HOLDING>). 14 . In Wilkie, the court analyzed a holding that a contractor who had substantially complied with the building specifications substantially performedholding that an insured has substantially complied with the change of beneficiary provisions of a life insurance policy when he has done all that he could to comply with the provisionsholding that insured substantially complied with the manner of changing the beneficiary as required by the policyholding that insured had not substantially complied with the policys change of beneficiary provisions when the hospitalized insured was physically unable to leave her bed and was unable to retrieve the policy from her lock box at the bank to return to the company for endorsement as required by the terms of the policyholding that the named insured was using an automobile when changing its tire & \n\nthe remedies previously available to insureds in certain scenarios involving bad-faith conduct by their insurers, inter alia, by authorizing punitive-damages awards. See generally Birth Center v. St. Paul Cos. Inc., 567 Pa. 386, 402, 787 A.2d 376, 386 (2001). Allstate removed the litigation to a federal district court. During pretrial proceedings, Wolfe filed an amended complaint and Allstate pursued summary relief, asserting that, as a third party to the Allstate\/Zierle insurance policy, Wolfe lacked standing to pursue damages under Section 8371. This position was grounded on two main premises. First, Allstate explained, under Ash v. Continental Insurance Co., 593 Pa. 523, 932 A.2d 877 (2007), Section 8371 created a form of an unliquidated tort claim. See id. at 536, 932 A.2d at 885 (<HOLDING>). Second, per longstanding Pennsylvania law, holding that an action for consequential damages to property whether the action is brought in contract or in tort is an action for injury to property within the threeyear statute of limitationsholding the twoyear period for filing a particular tort action such as assault and battery controls over the more general threeyear statute of limitations for tort actionsholding that connecticuts threeyear limitations period for tort suits set forth in conn genstat 52577 is the appropriate limitations period for civil rights actions under 1983holding in determining the appropriate limitations period that an action under 8371 is a statutorilycreated tort actionholding that an employees action against her employer for negligent supervision lies not in tort but with an action for breach of contract & \n\nstudent\u2019s education, \u201cincluding] the conduct and development of evaluations, eligibility determinations, IEPs, and educational placement.\u201d Michael C. ex rel Stephen C. v. Radnor Twp. Sch. Dist., 202 F.3d 642, 654 (3d Cir.2000). No such proceeding concerning E.M.\u2019s education has been initiated. Although the Majority devotes pages to discussing whether this case is a \u201cproceeding\u201d under \u00a7 1415, the proper inquiry is whether there exists a separate pending \u00a7 1415 proceeding, such as a due process complaint or an appeal of a ruling on such a complaint. Because \u201cstay put\u201d operates only \u201cMuring the pendency\u201d of such a proceeding, and no such proceeding has been initiated, \u00a7 1415\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d provision simply does not apply. See Moss by Mutakabbir v. Smith, 794 F.Supp. 11, 14 (D.D.C.1992) (<HOLDING>).

We agree with the district court that \u00a7 83-11-109 has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\u2019s risk and therefore the first Pireno factor weighs in favor of concluding \u00a7 83-11-109 regulates the business of insurance. American Bankers also argues that \u00a7 83-11-109 is not an integral part of the insurer-insured relationship and thus fails to meet the second Pireno factor. On the contrary, \u00a7 83-11-109 is an integral part of the insurer-insured relationship because it controls how disputes regarding uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage will be resolved.

Vivian, 601 N.W.2d at 874. The legislative history of the sex discrimination provision of Title VII is not substantial. Nevertheless, the federal courts which have examined Title VII\u2019s legislative history have found personal grooming codes that reflect customary modes of grooming having only an insignificant impact on employment opportunities do not constitute sex discrimination within the meaning of the Act. See, e.g., Barker v. Taft Broadcasting Co., 549 F.2d 400, 401-02 (6th Cir.1977); Knott, 527 F.2d at 1252; Dodge, 488 F.2d at 1337.

At the time of bankruptcy, \u00a7 172 of the Internal Revenue Code gave the debtor a claim for a tax refund if certain conditions were met. It was the combination of the law and the conditions made legally relevant by the law that conferred on the debtor a prepetition legal interest: the claim for a refund. In that way, the Segal debtors\u2019 claim for a refund is similar to the prepetition accrual of a cause of action that results in a post-petition judgment in the debtor\u2019s favor. In such eases, the debtor\u2019s cause of action is a prepetition legal interest \u2014 \u25a0\u00a7 541(a)(1) property- \u2014 -that brings the postpetition judgment into the estate as proceeds under \u00a7 541(a)(6).

Id. \u00a7 75-1-605(8). 136 This section of the UUTC directly conflicts with the holding of Banks. Under Banks, the settlor's intent at the time of creation of the trust was paramount because the settlor has created the trust he is no longer the owner of the trust property and has only such ability to deal with it as is expressly reserved to him in the trust instrument.\" Banks, 2002 UT 65, \u00b6 9, 52 P.3d 1190 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in Banks we noted that \"a settlor has the power to modify or revoke a trust only if and to the extent that such power is explicitly reserved by the terms of the trust.\" Id. Under this framework, a settlor may revoke or amend the trust only by strictly complying with its terms. See id. 112 (<HOLDING>). In contrast, the UUTC does not require strict holding that beneficiaries could not sue attorneys of the trust for legal malpractice because beneficiaries are not direct recipients of the attorneys servicesholding that nonsignatory settlor and trust beneficiaries could be compelled to arbitrate under account agreement between trustee and merrill lynch which contained an arbitration clause because agreement was the underlying basis for all the claims of the beneficiaries and there would have been no claims without the agreementholding that the settlor could divest the beneficiaries of their vested interests only by completely revoking the trust because she had limited her ability to eliminate the beneficiaries interests by including language in the trust stating that the interests of the beneficiaries shall continue until this trust is revoked or terminated internal quotation marks omittedholding that a union health trust had standing to sue tobacco companies to recover medical expenses paid by the trust and allegedly caused by beneficiaries smokingholding that trust beneficiaries have no authority to maintain an action as third party beneficiaries of contracts between the trustee and agents of the trustee concerning the internal affairs of the trust & \n\n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(8). Citing Foti, Zortman argues that because JCC\u2019s message indicated it was \u201cimportant\u201d that constitutes communicating information regarding a debt. Foti, 424 F.Supp.2d at 656 (noting that the message stated it that the \u201cmatter required immediate attention\u201d in concluding that the voicemail was a communication). JCC, for its part in the supplemental briefing, argued that its messages did not violate \u00a7 1692c(b) because they did not disclose that a particular consumer actually owed a debt. JCC points the Court to several cases, though not precisely on point, that indicate that a mere statement identifying a caller as a debt collector may not be sufficient to convey information regarding a debt. See Marx v. Gen. Revenue Corp., 668 F.3d 1174, 1177 (10th Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>); Zamos II v. Asset Acceptance, LLC, 423 holding that an entity engaged in collection activity on a defaulted debt acquired from another is a debt collector under the fdcpa even though it may actually be owed the debtholding that effect of discharge of debt under bankruptcy code is the same as it was under the 1898 bankruptcy act it is not an extinguishment of the debt but only a bar to enforcement of the debt as a personal obligation of the debt orholding that information was not fatally defective because while defendants name did not appear in the charging part of the information it did clearly appear in the caption and in the verification of the charge by the district attorneyholding that the name under which a debt collector is licensed to do business is the debt collectors true name for purposes of the fdcpaholding that a fax requesting employment information and verification did not convey information regarding a debt but also noting that the senders name and logo did not make explicit that the request was from a debt collector & \n\nof a plan...\u201d); \u00a7 1121(b) (\u201c...only the debtor may file a plan until after 120 days after the date of the order for relief\u2019). I find persuasive an additional reason why \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d should be construed to describe eligible transfers rather than to impose a temporal restriction on the transaction itself. As a description, \u201cunder a plan confirmed\u201d embodies an intent to exclude ordinary course of business and non-debtor transactions from the scope of \u00a7 1146(c).

Reasonableness, as shown by the movant, is essentially judged by looking to \u201cthe delay ... from the time the party is deemed to have notice of the grounds for its Rule 60(b) motion.\u201d Jones v. City of Richmond, 106 F.R.D. 485, 489 (E.D.Va.1985). In measuring this delay, however, there is no set time period distinguishing timely from untimely motions outside of the absolute, one-year time frame for Rule 60(b)(l)-(3) motions. What constitutes a reasonable time will generally depend on the facts of each case. See United States v. Wyle (In re Pacific Far East Lines, Inc.), 889 F.2d 242, 249 (9th Cir.1989). A major consideration may well be whether the nonmovant was prejudiced by the delay and whether the movant had a good reason for failing to take action sooner. Compare id. (<HOLDING>), with McLawhorn v. John W. Daniel & Co., 924 holding an internal error that caused the movant to receive the trustees notice of motion twentysix days after the court heard the trustees motion may have constituted excusable neglect had the movant made a prompt motion for reconsideration and pointing out it is the movants actions after he became aware of the existence of the trustees motion that reaches the level of willfulnessholding that the csu board of trustees and individual trustees sued in their official capacity are a political arm of the state and as such are immune from suitholding that a debtor could not relitigate the claim that the trustee breached his fiduciary duty because the bankruptcy court had already held that the trustees actions were not improperholding a bankruptcy trustees rule 60b6 motion timely despite a delay of eighteen months from the date of the court order and fifteen months from the denial of the trustees written request for a refund government found to have been put on notice of intention to reopen settlement by earlier actions of trusteeholding that the trustees preference actions against each of the defendants was precluded as a matter of law by the debtors earlier assumption of its agreements with them & \n\nhave uniform application within the class of those subject to its provisions. This attribute alone disqualifies WCTF\u2019s claim under \u00a7 65(8) from classification as a tax. B. The Principle of Equal Distribution. There is another reason, however, for treating claims under \u00a7 65(8) as non-tax claims. As noted above, Feiring teaches that the policies of the Bankruptcy Code establish the criteria upon which priority status of a claim is to be determined. 313 U.S. at 285, 61 S.Ct. 1028. Giving tax priority to WCTF\u2019s reimbursement claim here would enervate the Bankruptcy Code\u2019s central policy of equal distribution among similar creditors. See Lorber, 675 F.2d at 1067-68; New Neighborhoods, 886 F.2d at 718-19 (noting the need to limit priority claims in bankruptcy); Suburban II, 36 F.3d at 487 (<HOLDING>) (citing Begier v.

Furthermore, our sister courts have recently determined that, when the charged conduct arises out of. the same criminal episode, a charge for unlawful use of a two-way communications device under section 934.215 is subsumed within a charge of solicitation under section 847.0135(3) and subsumed within a charge of travelling to meet a minor after solicitation under section 847.0135(4).

Section 541(a)(7) makes property of the estate any interest in properly that the estate (not the debtor) acquires after the case. Here, the bankruptcy court found that the bonus constituted earnings from personal services of Mr. Markosian under \u00a7 1115(a)(2) and that ruling was not appealed. Thus, the earnings fall within the earnings exception stated in \u00a7 541(a)(6). We note however that there may be chapter 11 cases which are converted to chapter 7 where it is necessary to separate earnings from personal services by an individual from the earnings of a business. See FitzSimmons v. Walsh (In re FitzSimmons), 725 F.2d 1208, 1211 (9th Cir.1984) holding noncompete payments were not exempt from the debt ors bankruptcy estate as earnings from postpetition services under 541a6 because the noncompete agreement was inextricably intertwined with the debtors sale of stock that was an includable bankruptcy asset that predated debtors bankruptcy petitionholding that where the debtor is the owner of a policy insuring his own life and listing his wife as the beneficiary upon his death the proceeds of the policy including the cash value thereof are exempt from the claims of the insureds creditorsholding that proceeds of a personal injury settlement are not exempt under missouri lawholding that where subchapter s corporations revenue was generated from professional accounting services of its sole shareholder or from personal services performed under him funds generated by the business which shareholder withdrew to pay personal expenses although not denominated wages for purposes of bookkeeping could be considered wages for purposes of calculating preinjury wageholding that only the debtors earnings from his own personal services were exempt under 541a6 as opposed to all profits generated by his law practice & \n\nbut even if he is correct, AT & T would still be able to terminate his employment based on a mistaken application of the internal policy, if AT & T is correct that his employment was unconditionally at-will.

The doctrine of exhaustion \u201ccuts down on the holding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordrecognizing that exhaustion of state administrative remedies is not required as a prerequisite to bringing an action pursuant to 1983holding that under the apa exhaustion is a prerequisite to judicial review when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review so long as the administrative action is made inoperative pending that reviewholding that a courts authority to require exhaustion of administrative remedies in actions brought under the apa is limited when neither the statute nor agency rules specifically mandate exhaustion as a prerequisite to judicial reviewholding that judicial review under the apa is precluded when a remedy is available under a citizen suit provision of an environmental statute citations omitted & \n\nagency or an officer or employee thereof acted or failed to act in an official capacity or under color of legal authority shall not be dismissed nor relief therein be denied on the ground that it is against the United States or that the United States is an indispensable party. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702. The civil forfeiture in Plaintiffs\u2019 case was achieved by a consent judgment in judicial proceedings; the civil forfeiture did not involve agency action. By its own terms, \u00a7 702 only applies where the party seeks judicial review of agency action. Because the instant forfeiture took place in the context of a civil judicial proceeding, there is no agency action for the district court or this Court to review. See Comm, of Blind Vendors of D.C. v. District of Columbia, 28 F.3d 130, 134 (D.C.Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>). The APA therefore cannot be the basis for a holding that under the apa exhaustion is a prerequisite to judicial review when expressly required by statute or when an agency rule requires appeal before review so long as the administrative action is made inoperative pending that reviewholding that because here the statutes in issue provide for judicial review via citizen suit provisions yet do not set forth a standard for that review judicial review is limited to apa review on the administrative recordholding apa 5 usc 702 inapplicable because no agency proceeding took place for the court to reviewholding that the apa does not afford an implied grant of subjectmatter jurisdiction permitting federal judicial review of agency actionholding a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands & \n\nbecause CBFWA has alleged nineteen violations of the Agreement by BPA since 1991.

DEQ begins by observing that some federal courts have adopted a \u201crule of thumb\u201d that two years is an adequate time to obtain a final judicial decision on a challenge to a federal administrative agency order. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc., v. Hogan, 428 F3d 1059, 1064 (DC Cir 2005). The time it takes to fully litigate a challenge to a federal administrative agency order or rule, however, may be different from the time it would take to challenge an Oregon agency\u2019s order or rule under the Oregon Administrative Procedure Act. Moreover, the \u201crule of thumb\u201d that DEQ identifies does not appear to have been uniformly followed by federal courts, particularly in cases involving challenges to NPDES permits.

See generally S. Rep. 106-150 at 5, 7, 10. And GasPlus\u2019s interests were clearly regulated by the BIA\u2019s decision to void the Management Agreement. Indeed, GasPlus\u2019s basic argument in this lawsuit is that the BIA has imposed a greater burden on GasPlus (and the Nambe Pueblo) than what Congress intended when it amended Section 81. The prudential standing test, which \u201cis not meant to be especially demanding,\u201d Clarke v. Sec. Indus. Assoc., 479 U.S. 388, 399, 107 S.Ct. 750, 93 L.Ed.2d 757 (1987), is therefore satisfied. The other standing requirements are also satisfied. GasPlus has suffered an injury in fact: namely, the loss of its rights and benefits arising from the Management Agreement. See, e.g., Idaho Power Co. v. F.E.R.C., 312 F.3d 454, 460 (D.C.Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>).

The only exception to this doctrine occurs where the statute on which the federal cause of action is based constitutes an express or implied repeal of \u00a7 1738. We find no evidence of such a repeal in ERISA.

Alejandrino Manangan responds to the issue whether his petition for review should be dismissed. Manangan petitioned this court for review of a Merit Systems Protection Board decision denying his request for a deferred retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS). In the initial decision, the administrative judge determined that Manangan was not entitled to a Civil Service Retirement Act (CSRA) annuity because his service was pursuant to excepted temporary or indefinite appointments. See Rosete v. Office of Personnel Management, 48 F.3d 514 (Fed.Cir.1995) (upholding OPM\u2019s interpretation that an indefinite appointment is excluded from CSRS coverage); see also Casilang v. Office of Personnel Management, 248 F.3d 1381, 1383 (Fed.Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). Manangan argues in his response that his case holding that the appeal was properly before the court where the appellant appealed from an order amending a prior order without appealing from the prior orderholding that the revocation of executive order no 10180 in 1955 did not automatically convert indefinite excluded appointments into appointments covered by the csra because executive order no 10530 kept in place the exclusion of nonpermanent employees from coverage by the csra effected by executive order no 10180 until the civil service commission promulgated new regulations which it did in 1956holding that an order by the trial court remanding the cause to the agency to impose a sanction other than the one imposed by the agency was not a final and appealable order because it did not terminate the litigation between the parties on the meritsholding that when the executive branch defaults a district court has the authority to appoint a prosecutor for contempt proceedings in order to preserve respect for the judicial system itselfholding order granting a new trial is not a final appealable order because it does not terminate the action or any of the claims or parties in the action & \n\npublic interest.\u201d Administrative agencies are far better suited than \u00e1re courts to make determinations based on the broad policy question of what is in the \u201cpublic interest.\u201d Third, \u00a7 925(c) contains a restriction on the consideration of new evidence by the district courts, stating; \u201cThe court may in its discretion admit additional evidence where failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.\u201d This constraint on the admission of evidence suggests that the initial adjudication of applications is limited to the Secretary of the Treasury.

Notably, \u201cthe trial court\u2019s task at the summary judgment motion state of litigation is carefully limited to discerning whether there are genuine issues of material fact to be tried, not to decide them.

When more than one inference can be reasonably drawn, it is for the trier of fact to determine the proper one. Id. Thus, if a reasonable fact finder evaluating the evidence could draw more than one inference from the facts, and if that inference introduces a genuine issue of material fact, then the court should not grant the summary judgment motion. See Augusta Iron & Steel Works, Inc., 835 F.2d at 856. In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, it is well-established that the court may neither adjudge the credibility of the witnesses nor weigh the evidence. See Pita v.

Thus it was May 27, not May 26, when Harper fell from the tree. 5 . We have considered all of Harper's other arguments and find they lack merit. Harper claims, for example, that defendants could not have heard Perkins alert them to the gun in the tree because both defendants said they saw Harper holding the gun. Yet Harper testified that Gourley tasered him immediately after Perkins shouted the gun\u2019s location. From this testimony, which we must credit at summary judgment, we can only infer that defendants tasered Harper in response to Perkins's cry. The evidence does not support alternative inferences, e.g., that defendants would have tasered Harper even if they knew plaintiff could not reach the gun. See Mize v. Jefferson City Bd. of Educ., 93 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir. 1996) holding movant may not raise new grounds for summary judgment in reply to nonmovants responseholding that a superior court justice may not choose between conflicting inferences at summary judgment stageholding that district court should not have granted summary judgment solely on basis that motion for summary judgment was not opposedholding court need not withhold summary judgment if nonmovants inferences implausibleholding that nonmovants failure to except or respond cannot supply by default the grounds for summary judgment or the summary judgment proof necessary to establish the movants right & \n\nand as Next Friend of Jonathan Espeche, a minor, take nothing by reason of her suit....\u201d Because Espeche\u2019s live pleading at the time judgment was signed, November 5, contained a claim on behalf of Jonathan, the record demonstrates the trial court considered Espeche's second amended original petition. 7 . In addition, there is a practical reason why Ritzell\u2019s amended motion was not properly before the court. Had the trial court actually granted Ritzell leave to file the amended motion so close to the date of the hearing, Es-peche would have been entitled, pursuant to Rule 166a(c), to a period of time in which to file a response to the new ground presented in the amended motion.

As such, the appellant was blindsided by the trial court\u2019s judgment in that, prior to the judgment entry, it was never put on notice as to a Rule 55.09 justification for granting summary judgment. This would have been true even if the appellant had been given the requisite 30 days to respond. Without such notice, the appellant\u2019s due process right to respond to the respondent\u2019s motion was effectively denied by the trial court\u2019s failure to confine itself to the alleged undisputed facts of the summary judgment record made, providing an additional basis for us to reverse the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.

In conducting this review, \u201c[i]t is not our job to weigh the evidence.\u201d Gray v. Spillman, 925 F.2d 90, 95 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, disputed questions of fact must be resolved in favor of the non-moving party at the summary judgment stage. See Davis v.

The presentation of a potential genuine issue of material fact weighed against the lack of corroborating evidence indicates the need for discovery prior to the resolution of a motion for summary judgment.

Despite the fact that the plaintiff relies on holding that the court is in no position to decide whether there is a genuine dispute because the district court did not permit any discovery before issuing its rulingholding that an appellate court can affirm a district courts order on any basis for which there is a record sufficient to permit conclusions of law including grounds upon which the district court did not relyholding that summary judgment is not appropriate if there is a genuine dispute about a material factholding that the appeals court may affirm the ruling of the district court on any basis which the record supportsholding that when there is no ruling by the states highest court it is the duty of the federal court to determine as best it can what the highest court of the state would decide & \n\nLobby Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). The evidence, all facts, and any reasonable inferences from the facts must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v.

On appeal, WCI challenges the district court\u2019s determination that the assumption and indemnification clauses in the Purchase Agreement place the liability for the cleanup of the Edison Facility on WCI. WCI does not contest the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on its claims under CERCLA, the Spill Act, or negligence, and thus has waived its right to appellate review of these claims. See Bickel v. Korean Air Lines Co., 96 F.3d 151, 153 (6th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>).

However, cross motions for summary judgments do authorize the court to assume that there is no evidence which needs to be considered other than that which has been filed by the parties. Harrison W.

The District Court reserved decision. Because Jacob failed to renew his motion within ten days of the entry of final judgment, as is required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50, he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b); Williams v. Guzzardi, 875 F.2d 46, 50 n. 6 (3d Cir.1989). In his reply brief, Jacob argues that even if he waived his claim for judgment as a matter of law, we should nonetheless review his sufficiency of the evidence argument and, if we find that there was insufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, grant a new trial.

Therefore, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Defendant Lee on De Contreras\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim. B. De Contreras\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment Claim Against Lee and Mastaler for Fabricating Police Reports The record lacks any evidence to support Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that Lee or Mastaler fabricated their police reports. Furthermore, as De Contreras was convicted on the charges alleged in the police reports (see April 9, 2012 Minute Order Granting Motion to Dismiss at 7 (Doc.

Generally, Congress\u2019 intention to preempt may holding that in light of the presumption against preemption there is no field preemption of state unfair competition claims that rely on a substantial question of federal patent law because congress has not expressed its clear and manifest intention to preempt that area of lawholding that ejxcept in matters governed by the federal constitution or by acts of congress the law to be applied in any case is the law of the stateholding that the rights and duties of the united states on commercial paper which it issues are governed by federal law and that in the absence of an applicable act of congress it is for the federal courts to fashion the governing rule of law according to their own standardsholding that where a conflict between state and federal law is alleged it must be reasonable to conclude that congress would have intended to preclude the state law in question since it would make little sense to preempt state law in order to serve the purposes underlying federal legislation if congress itself would not require or admit of preemption of state authorityholding that preemption is not foreclosed by the fact that the federal statute intrudes into the range of subjects over which the states have traditionally exercised their police powers if congress intent to displace state law is clear & \n\nthe case must be adjudicated before the NLRB. See Baker v. IBP, Inc., 357 F.3d 685, 688 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cApplied to claims in federal court, and arising under federal law, Garmon has nothing to do with either preemption or subject-matter jurisdiction. It is a rule of primary jurisdiction, allocating to an administrative agency the first crack at certain matters.\u201d). Accordingly, Garmon preemption provides no basis for removal jurisdiction in federal court. A case falling within the scope of the doctrine must be adjudicated before the NLRB. The lower courts are uniform in finding that Garmon preemption under the NLRA does not completely preempt state laws so as to provide removal jurisdiction. See, e.g., Ethridge v. Harbor House Rest., 861 F.2d 1389, 1399-1400 (9th Cir.1988) (<HOLDING>); Suarez v. Gallo Wine Distribs.

See Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U.S. 202, 210-13, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 1910-12, 85 L.Ed.2d 206 (1985) (state law claims preempted by federal labor law where evaluation of the state claim requires consideration of the terms of a collective bargaining agreement); Lingle v.

Accordingly, we must reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Mrs. Tompkin\u2019s design defect and failure to warn claims. B. Mrs. Tompkin additionally contends that the district court erred in concluding that OPLA preempted her negligence and wilful and wanton misconduct claims. This court has applied OPLA to product Lability negligence claims and has therefore implicitly concluded that common law negligence claims have been preempted by OPLA. See Amendola, 1999 WL 1111515, at *2 (<HOLDING>). Additionally, the Faugh court, using the recognizing torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distressholding that the plaintiffs negligent misrepresentation and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims are governed by oplaholding that a party claiming negligent infliction of emotional distress cannot recover for emotional disturbance aloneholding that plaintiffs negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims are not independent of the breach of contract claim and summary judgment is warranted on these claimsholding negligent misrepresentation sufficient & \n\nthe Garmon doctrine is applicable subject to the existing exceptions. If it involves the NLRA and another federal statute, then the Garmon doctrine is inapplicable as a general rule unless the underlying federal claim is illegal only by way of the NLRA. That is, if the defendant\u2019s conduct is perfectly legal but for the proscriptions of the NLRA, then those determinations of potential illegality should be left to the expertise of the NLRB. Likewise, if the conduct in question is federally chargeable independent of the NLRA (even if it is also arguably covered by the NLRA), then the Garmon doctrine does not apply because the two implicated federal statutes may both be given their intended purpose. See, e.g., Smith v. Nat\u2019l Steel & Shipbuilding Co., 125 F.3d 751, 754-57 (9th Cir.1997) (<HOLDING>); United States v. International Brotherhood of holding that garmon preemption is inapplicable in eases involving the americans with disabilities actholding that a private party may bring an action in a federal district court seeking injunctive relief on the basis of garmon preemption for only arguably protected or prohibited activityholding that 502a may serve as an independent basis for preemption where 514a the blanket erisa preemption provision is inapplicableholding removal and preemption are distinct concepts erisa preemption does not allow removal unless complete preemption existsholding that garmon preemption provides no basis for removal jurisdiction in federal court and observing that the lower courts are uniform in finding that garmon preemption under the nlra does not completely preempt state laws so as to provide removal jurisdiction & \n\nclaims.

Anderson, 539 U.S. 1, 8, 123 S.Ct. 2058, 156 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003) (discussing the limited categories of cases where the Supreme Court has found complete preemption). The only circuit court to have considered whether the PMPA triggers the complete preemption doctrine is the Ninth Circuit, which found that it did not. Yorn v. Union Oil Co. of Calif., 952 F.2d 408 (tbl.), 1992 WL 2872 (9th Cir. Jan. 7, 1992) (un-pub.). In an unpublished opinion, the Ninth Circuit held that \u201c[wjhile the PMPA may provide Unocal with a viable pre-emption defense to Yorn\u2019s common law claims, it is for the California courts to make this determinatio .D.Pa.1986) (<HOLDING>). Sunoco cites one instance where a federal holding that pmpa preempted new york statutory law governing the termination or nonrenewal of franchises but did not preempt state contract claim which did not involve the termination of the franchise relationshipholding that fraud claim concerning nonrenewal of franchise agreement was preempted by pmpaholding that pmpa preempted state statute regarding the ter initiation and nonrenewal of franchises and state commonlaw claimholding that the plaintiffs state law claims were preempted by pmpa because they sought to impose standards more stringent than the pmpa regarding the termination or nonrenewal of his franchiseholding state law claim premised on implied duty of good faith was preempted by the pmpa because it concerned the termination of a petroleum franchise & \n\nexemption statutes like Mo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 513.-430(10)(e). A credible argument against ERISA\u2019s preemption of such state exemption statutes exists and has been adopted by what one court has called an \u201cemerging minority.\u201d In re Kazi, 125 B.R. 981 (Bankr.S.D.Ill.1991). The Eighth Circuit has recently resolved this issue against the position taken by the trustee, by holding, \u201c... ERISA does not preempt state law exemptions of pension plan benefits reasonably necessary for the support of a debtor.\u201d In re Vickers, 954 F.2d 1426 (8th Cir.1992). However, when the Debtors asserted their exemptions the courts within the Eighth Circuit that had considered this pre-emption question had reached conflicting results and the Circuit Court had not yet ruled. See In re Gaines, 121 B.R. 1015 (W.D.Mo.1990) (<HOLDING>), compare, In re Vickers, 116 B.R. 149 holding that erisa completely preempted certain state law claims and finding that erisa preempted an employees common law tort and contract claim when the employee sought benefits under the employers disability policyholding a state workers compensation regime preempted by erisa to the extent state law applied to pension plans governed by federal lawholding that erisa does not preempt revstatmo 51343010e because it is entirely consistent with both erisa and the bankruptcy codeholding that to the extent revstatmo 51343010e affects erisa it is preemptedholding that a state election law is preempted only to the extent that it conflicts with federal law & \n\nto prohibit arbitration in one type of contract, this is a determination by the Mississippi legislature to control the risks and harms caused by uninsured and underinsured motorists, see Id. We agree with the district court that \u00a7 83-11-109 has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\u2019s risk and therefore the first Pireno factor weighs in favor of concluding \u00a7 83-11-109 regulates the business of insurance. American Bankers also argues that \u00a7 83-11-109 is not an integral part of the insurer-insured relationship and thus fails to meet the second Pireno factor. On the contrary, \u00a7 83-11-109 is an integral part of the insurer-insured relationship because it controls how disputes regarding uninsured\/underinsured motorist coverage will be resolved. See West, 267 F.3d at 823 (<HOLDING>); accord McKnight, 358 F.3d at 858; Mut. holding that a missouri state law excepting insurance contracts from an arbitration law regulated the business of insurance because it applied to the processing of disputed claims and had a substantial effect on the insureiinsured relationshipholding that under georgia law a holder of a master insurance policy is an agent of the insurance company and not the insurerholding that the mccarranferguson act which bars application of a federal law in the face of a state law enacted for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance did not preclude the concurrent assertion of the federal rico statute and nevada insurance lawholding that erisa preempted state law claim brought by employer against insurance company for wrongful claims processingrecognizing that the duty arises not from the terms of the insurance contract but from an obligation imposed in law as a result of the special relationship & \n\n] the primary object of the patent laws\u201d to promote future innovation. Id. Preemption is therefore part and parcel with the \u00a7 101 inquiry. For example, we have often cited the lack of preemption concerns to support a determination that a claim is patent-eligible under \u00a7 101. See, e.g., McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc., 837 F.3d 1299, 1315-16 (Fed. Cir. 2016); BASCOM, 827 F.3d at 1352 (\u201c[T]he claims of the ... patent do not preempt the use of the abstract idea of filtering content on the Internet or on generic computer components performing conventional activities.\u201d). But we have consistently held that claims that are otherwise directed to patent-ineligible subject matter cannot be saved by arguing the absence of complete preemption. See, e.g., Synopsys, 839 F.3d at 1150 (<HOLDING>); FairWarning, 839 F.3d at 1098 (\u201cBut even holding that there was no federal question removal jurisdiction under the complete preemption exception to the wellpleaded complaint ruleholding that removal is proper based on complete preemption only when congress intended the federal cause of action to be exclusiveholding that an argument about the absence of complete preemption misses the markholding that a party did not waive its preemption defense where its answer did not specifically mention preemption but contained a broader defense that was capable of encompassing preemptionholding removal and preemption are distinct concepts erisa preemption does not allow removal unless complete preemption exists & \n\nhabeas federal district court failed to consider the substance of the statutory defense coded at ... \u00a7 25 ... when [it] deferred to the state [court\u2019s] ... dismissal .... \u201d); and 3 (\u201cThe federal district court[\u2019s] procedural ruling erred in determining that the State courts had made an \u2018adequate\u2019 determination within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).\u201d). We therefore deny COA on this argument. B. Allegedly Perjured Testimony Mr. Clark argued in his habeas petition that his due process rights had been violated because a witness falsely testified that she attended school with him. The district court held that such an allegation of state trial error did not present a federal question cognizable in a federal habeas corpus action. See Brinlee v. Crisp, 608 F.2d 839, 843 (10th Cir.1979) (<HOLDING>). The court held that Mr. Clark had failed to holding that an error pertaining to a mixed question of law and fact under state law is not cognizable in a federal habeas proceedingholding that claims of mere state court procedural or trial error not resulting in a deprivation of fundamental rights were not cognizable in a federal habeas corpus actionholding that the federal habeas corpus court could reach the merits of a due process claim even though there was no contemporaneous objection in state court trial where the state habeas corpus court reached the merits rather than rely on the procedural default defenseholding that consideration of a claim in a petition for habeas corpus can be barred by failure to comply with state procedural rulesholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nconditions on defendants\u2019 land.\u201d Wilkerson, 845 S.W.2d at 750. Although the Wilkerson court also noted that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim was \u201cfounded upon the duty of reasonable care owed to a social guest\/invitee by a social guest\/landowner,\u201d id., in light of the fact that the Statute does not itself distinguish between those duties, the Wilkerson case is best understood for its primary holding that the Statute does not apply where \u201c[t]he condition of the premises where the accident occurred is not at issue.\u201d Id. This holding is borne out by the substantial case law applying the Recreational Use Statute only in situations involving \u201cpremises liability\u201d and \u201cfailure to warn\u201d causes of action. See, e.g., Spence v. Tennessee Valley Authority, No. 3:05-0519, 2006 WL 1416759 at *4 (May 17, 2006) (<HOLDING>); Sumner v.

Plaintiffs state law failure to train claim is dismissed because it is expressly barred by La. R.S. \u00a7 9:2798. 1(B), which provides public officials with immunity for discretionary functions like training. See Smith v. Lafayette Parish Sheriffs Dpt., 874 So.2d 863, 867 (La. Ct.

Farmer, 430 U.S. at 305, 97 S.Ct. 1056. Thomas has not met either of these requirements. Therefore, because Thomas\u2019s wrongful discharge and civil conspiracy claims amount to a claim for a breach of the duty of fair representation and a Farmer exception to preemption does not apply, Thomas\u2019s claims are preempted by federal labor law. Because Thomas did not bring a federal claim within the applicable six-month statute of limitations for claims asserting a violation of the duty of fair representation, such a federal claim is now barred as untimely. See DelCostello v. International Bhd. of Teamsters, 462 U.S. 151, 169-70, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 2293-94, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983) (<HOLDING>); Arnold v.

Ala. R.Crim. P. 32.7(d). While the Court of Criminal Appeals refers to all three of these rules in its peitinent order, we focus our analysis on Rule 32.6(b), as Frazier\u2019s failure to provide \"full disclosure of the factual basis\u201d of the relevant claim was the sine qua non of the Court of Criminal Appeals\u2019s dismissal. 7 . It is uncontroversial that \"[i]f the petitioner has failed to exhaust state remedies that are no longer available, that failure is a procedural default which will bar federal habeas relief, unless either the cause and prejudice or the fundamental miscarriage of justice exception is established.\u201d Smith v. Jones, 256 F.3d 1135, 1138 (11th Cir.2001); see also Owen v. Sec\u2019y for Dep't of Corr., 568 F.3d 894, 908 (11th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>). Because we find no procedural default, we holding that a petitioner may overcome a procedural default by demonstrating either 1 an adequate cause for and actual prejudice arising from the default or 2 that a miscarriage of justice caused by a substantial denial of constitutional rights will occur if the petitioners federal claims are not considered quoting lynd v terry 470 f3d 1308 131314 11th cir2006holding that in the case of state procedural default a federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate among other things that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justiceholding that trial court must make entry of default prior to entry of default judgment and court may not make entry of default when there is no default in law or in factholding that a federal court may excuse a state habeas petitioners procedural default if the petitioner can show cause for the failure to raise the claim and prejudice resulting from such failureholding that the novelty of a petitioners claim can constitute cause for a procedural default & \n\nof his actual innocence. Accordingly, the court will deny claim six as procedurally barred. F. Claim Seven: Post-conviction Proceedings Violated Petitioner\u2019s Due Process And Equal Protection Rights In his seventh claim, petitioner contends that the Delaware Supreme Court\u2019s summary affirmance of his post-conviction appeal violated his right to equal protection and due process. He complains that the State Supreme Court failed to give a thorough and comprehensive review and analysis of his Massiah claims. The court concludes that this claim alleges a state law claim that is not cognizable on federal habeas relief, because petitioner\u2019s ultimate criticism is with the Delaware State Courts\u2019 analysis in a state collateral proceeding. See Hassine v. Zimmerman, 160 F.3d 941, 954 (3d Cir.1998)(<HOLDING>)(emphasis in original); see also Lambert v. holding habeas petitioners may show cause for such default in specific circumstances in states that require petitioners to raise iatc claims in initial state habeas proceedings rather than on direct appealholding that the federal role in reviewing an application for habeas corpus is limited to evaluating what occurred in the state or federal proceedings that actually led to the petitioners conviction what occurred in the petitioners collateral proceeding does not enter into the habeas proceedingholding federal habeas proceeding was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies when petitioners direct appeal from resentencing was still pending in state court at the time he sought habeas reliefholding that once federal jurisdiction has attached it is not defeated by the petitioners release prior to completion of the proceedings on his habeas applicationholding that federal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law & \n\nin federal court, \u201c[t]he state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.\u201d United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 725, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966). Congress codified this holding in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(a), which provides that when district courts have original jurisdiction, \u201cthe district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same ease or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\u201d Once a district court decides the state claims derive from the same operative facts, it possesses discretion to determine whether to deny exercising supplemental jurisdiction. See Gibbs, 383 U.S. at 726, 86 S.Ct. 1130 (<HOLDING>); Carnegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, 484 U.S. holding a district courts application of supplemental jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion not of plaintiffs rightholding that a district court retained supplemental jurisdiction over the plaintiffs statelaw claims after dismissing the plaintiffs federal claims and did not abuse its discretion by declining to remand the case to state courtholding that jurisdiction must be resolved before applying the act of state doctrine because that doctrine is a substantive rule of lawholding that district courts do not have appellate jurisdiction over state courtsholding law of case doctrine is procedural and does not go to jurisdiction of court & \n\nin the child\u2019s mother, Procanik; for a child\u2019s cystic fibrosis on a doctor who failed to test a symptomatic sibling for that genetic disease, Sckroeder; or for a child\u2019s Down\u2019s Syndrome on a doctor who failed to warn a pregnant woman that her age put her at increased risk of delivering a child with that condition, Berman. It is quite another to impose liability for prescribing a drug that had no connection with a birth defect. In one ease, the condition is the foreseeable result of the doctor\u2019s omission; in the other, it is not. The majority\u2019s result is unprecedented in any jurisdiction.

To determine the applicability of this enhancement, the district court may consider all relevant conduct. Id. at \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A)-(B). Since .the court may consider all relevant conduct, it follows that the court\u2019s assessment is not \u201climited to the charged conspiracy.\u201d See, e.g., United States v.

Thus, the clear and convincing proof standard reduces the risk to the alleged wrongdoer of having his or her reputation tarnished erroneously by increasing the plaintiffs burden of proof.

Under these requirements, Allstate has adequately alleged a violation of \u00a7\u00a7 25400 and 25500. According to Allstate, Stern willfully participated in the conveyance of misleading information to investors through its involvement in investigating, drafting, and reviewing the data set forth in the Official Statements. Given that role, Stern had a duty to disclose any known information necessary to prevent the Official Statements from being false or misleading. See Howard, 228 F.3d at 1061 (<HOLDING>). Allstate has further alleged that Stern holding a defendant may be convicted of mail fraud if he knowingly and willfully participates in a fraudulent scheme created and set in motion by othersholding that no judgment can be rendered against defendant who cannot be held liableholding that a person violates the bank fraud statute when he knowingly executes a scheme to obtain money from a financial institution by means of false or fraudulent representations if a defendant knowingly provided materially false information in order to induce the loan the crime is complete and it is irrelevant whether or not he intended to repay or was capable of repaying itholding that a defendant can be held liable when it knowingly participates in the creation of a false or misleading statementholding that the elements of a claim under 3729a2 are 1 that the defendant made used or caused to be made or used a record or statement to get a claim against the united states paid or approved 2 the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent and 3 the defendant knew that the record or statement and the claim were false or fraudulent emphasis added & \n\nthe website looked like Heather. But in analyzing a judicial deception claim, we need not scrutinize police investigative tactics in this fashion. 10 . As discussed above, the materiality of an omission is an issue for the court. 11 . The Ewings quote Shirk's testimony from Prater and Memory's trial, but the officers obviously did not have this information at the time they prepared the warrant affidavit. The Ewings also fault the officers for not asking Shirk more questions, such as whether he had been drinking, how long he looked at the female, whether her helmet face shield was up or down, and what the lighting conditions were. But judicial deception claims do not require an inquiry into the quality of the police investigation. See generally Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-36, 103 S.Ct. 2317 (<HOLDING>). 12 . After the Ewings' arrest, Contreras did holding that allegations in a pro se complaint are to be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the complaint submitted by a pro se plaintiff must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersholding that the allegations in a pro se complaint are held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyersrecognizing that because affidavits are typically drafted in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation by nonlawyers they must be read with an understanding of that context and accordingly held to a lower standard of scrutiny than that applied to pleadings filed in more formal proceedingsholding that affidavits for search warrants must be interpreted in a commonsense and realistic fashion because they are normally drafted by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation & \n\nversa. Id. This court reviews a district court\u2019s determination of inequitable conduct under a two-tiered standard: we review the underlying factual determinations of materiality and intent for clear error, and we review the ultimate decision as to inequitable conduct for an abuse of discretion. Star Scientific, 537 F.3d at 1365. If the district court\u2019s inequitable conduct determination rests on a clearly erroneous finding of materiality or intent, it constitutes an abuse of discretion and must be reversed. Id. We agree with Honda that the undisclosed 96RL information was material to the Three-Status patent because the jury found, and the court upheld, the asserted claims as anticipated by the 96RL system, and ACI has not appealed that decision to us. See Therasense, 649 F.3d at 1291-92 (<HOLDING>). The materiality of the undisclosed holding that in reviewing a defendants motion for judgment of acquittal based on insanity which the defendant must prove by clear and convincing evidence the court must determine whether no reasonable jury could have failed to find that the defendants criminal insanity at the time of the offense was established by clear and convincing evidenceholding that if a claim is properly invalidated in district court based on the deliberately withheld reference then that reference is necessarily material because a finding of invalidity in a district court requires clear and convincing evidence a higher evidentiary burden than that used in prosecution at the ptoholding that a finding of fraud may be reversed only for clear error but that the finding must be judged in view of the clear and convincing burden of proofholding that fraud on the court must be supported by clear unequivocal and convincing evidenceholding that appellate court may infer that district court considered sentencing guidelines policy statements despite district courts failure to make explicit reference to them & \n\nthe assets at stake were artwork or cash, the Defendants, through a series of complex transactions, have succeeded in moving such assets from trusts and accounts in which the Plaintiff had the right of access, to trusts and accounts in which she did not. Thus, all of the alleged predicates of mail fraud, wire fraud and money laundering are related insofar as they served either to execute the fraud, or mask it. See, e.g., Jacobson v. Cooper, 882 F.2d 717, 720 (2d Cir.1989) (although plaintiff alleged separate acts involving separate properties, relatedness present where all acts had purported effect of depriving plaintiff of his interest in real estate entity). At this stage, nothing more is required. See, e.g., Koal Indus. v. Asland, S.A., 808 F.Supp. 1143, 1161-62 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (<HOLDING>). The Plaintiff has also met the continuity holding that to prevail under civil rico plaintiff must prove that defendants participated in the conduct of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activityholding that plaintiff stated pattern of racketeering activity where defendants allegedly committed various predicates with common design of defrauding plaintiffs of money and obtaining control of coal mineholding that a pattern of racketeering activity required multiple illegal schemesholding that plaintiffs allegation that defendant engaged in multiple instances of mail and wire fraud did not allege pattern of racketeering activity with sufficient particularityholding that racketeering predicates must be related and amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity & \n\nthat Title VII hostile work environment plaintiffs need not prove a pattern, \u201csteady barrage,\u201d or other minimum quantum of discriminatory conduct in order to establish actionable harassment. See Torres v. Pisano, 116 F.3d 625, 631 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cOf course, even a single episode of harassment, if severe enough, can establish a hostile work environment.\u201d); Davis v.

A party claiming a breach of contract must establish by a preponderance of the evidence (1) that there was a contract, (2) that the other party breached the contract and, (3) that the party asserting breach of contract suffered damages as a result of the breach.

The alleged concealment of both the conflict of interest, Press, 218 F.3d at 130, and the excessive commissions, Ettinger, 835 F.2d at 1033, satisfy the materiality requirement. 55 . While the QPA-2 and the fixed portions of the other annuities were not \"securities\u201d under federal securities laws, because they were part of the putative pay-to-play scheme, they cannot be used to support a civil RICO claim. See Bald Eagle, 189 F.3d at 329-30 (<HOLDING>). As such, the Court rejects Plaintiff's holding breach of best execution duty is a material misrepresentation in connection with the purchase or sale of the securitiesholding that a plaintiff alleging securities fraud must show that a defendant 1 made a material misrepresentation or a material omission as to which he or she had a duty to speak 2 with scienter 3 in connection with the purchase or sale of securitiesholding that evidence was sufficient to support convictions for willfully engaging in fraudulent conduct in connection with sale of securities because kjnowledge that the act violates the securities laws is not relevantholding that a claim arises from the purchase or sale of a security only if there is an allegation of fraud in the purchase sale or issuance of the instrumentholding that 1 even if some conduct is not actionable as securities fraud that conduct cannot support a civil rico claim if it was also undertaken in connection with the purchase of a security and 2 conduct in maintaining ponzi scheme was conduct undertaken in connection with the purchase or sale of securities & \n\nclass members nationwide would predominate over common ones, given the lack of a national market or a nationwide conspiracy. Appellants contend that they should not have been required to prove national market or nationwide conspiracy at the class certification stage because these are not required elements of their antitrust claims. Recovery under \u00a7 4 of the Clayton Act, however, requires proof of antitrust impact, which in turn requires proof of the relevant market. Ala. v.

II. DISCUSSION A. Standard of Review A district court hearing an appeal from a Bankruptcy Court reviews the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s findings of fact under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard, see Fed.R.Bankr.P. 8013, while its conclusions of law are reviewed under the de novo standard.

Behm\u2019s argument that he cannot be found to have violated the rules at issue without an express finding of intent is also without merit. While this Court has held that \u201cin order to sustain a violation of rule 4-8.4(c), the Bar must prove intent,\u201d this Court has also stated that the intent ele ment can be satisfied \u201cmerely by showing that the conduct was deliberate or knowing.\u201d Fla. Bar v. Brown, 905 So.2d 76, 81 (Fla.2005); see also Fla. Bar v. Riggs, 944 So.2d 167, 171 (Fla.2006) (<HOLDING>); Fla. Bar v.
