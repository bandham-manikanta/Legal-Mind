Reasoning: This answer is derived from the general principles guiding the application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35(a)(1), which emphasizes the need for the condition to be ""in controversy"" and for the moving party to demonstrate ""good cause"" for the examination. This typically involves a showing that the mental examination is crucial for the just resolution of the case, taking into account the specific circumstances of the litigation. While the provided contexts do not directly address Rule 35(a)(1), the reasoning is based on standard legal interpretations of this rule in federal civil procedure.",llama3_gen_q006

Reasoning: This answer is inferred from the general understanding of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35(a)(1), which typically requires that for a court to order a mental examination, two key conditions must be met: (1) the mental condition in question must be ""in controversy,"" implying it is directly relevant to the issues of the case, and (2) ""good cause"" must be shown, indicating the examination is justified and necessary for resolving the controversy. This interpretation aligns with the rule's intent to balance the need for relevant evidence with the protection of parties' privacy and well-being.

Reasoning: This answer is inferred from the general principles of civil procedure, although the specific contexts provided (1-25) do not directly address Rule 35(a)(1). However, the reasoning can be deduced from the emphasis on discretion in judicial decision-making (Context 3), the requirement for specific standards for certain legal actions (implied across various contexts), and the principle that evidence or actions must be relevant and necessary for the case at hand (e.g., Context 14 discussing the burden of proof and relevance in evidence admission).",llama3_gen_q006

**Reasoning:** This answer is inferred from the general principles guiding the application of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35(a)(1), which typically requires that for a court to order a mental examination, two key conditions must be met: 
1. **""In Controversy"" Requirement**: The mental condition of the party must be directly at issue in the litigation. This means the case's outcome hinges, at least in part, on the party's mental state.
2. **""Good Cause"" Requirement**: There must be a sufficient reason for the examination, implying that the information sought cannot be obtained through other means (like discovery) and is crucial for resolving the case. This ensures the examination is not merely speculative or harassing.
