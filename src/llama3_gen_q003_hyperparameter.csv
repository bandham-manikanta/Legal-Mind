Alabama (2012), which held that mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles are unconstitutional.

Reasoning: This answer is derived from Context 8, which discusses the intersection of the Eighth Amendment and sentencing guidelines. The context clarifies that Miller v. Alabama (2012) is a pivotal case that altered the landscape for juvenile sentencing, making mandatory life sentences without parole for juveniles unconstitutional. This is in contrast to Harmelin v. Michigan (1991), which allowed for such sentences in the context of adult offenders. The distinction highlights that the unconstitutionality specifically pertains to the application of mandatory life sentences to juvenile defendants, underlining the importance of considering the defendant's age at the time of the offense in sentencing determinations.",llama3_gen_q003

Alabama, or one that fails to consider the sentencing factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a), leading to an unreasonable sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.

Reasoning: This answer is derived from the contexts provided, particularly Context 8, which discusses the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment in the context of juvenile defendants (Miller v. Alabama), and Contexts 1 and 3, which mention the review of sentences for ""reasonableness"" under an abuse-of-discretion standard, considering factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a).

0.5,0.7,0.0,0.8366521596908569,"Answer: A mandatory sentence of life without the possibility of parole for a non-homicide crime committed by a juvenile, as it violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, as established in Miller v. Alabama.
